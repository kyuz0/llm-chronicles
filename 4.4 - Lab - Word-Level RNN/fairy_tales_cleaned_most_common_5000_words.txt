the happy prince. high above the city on a tall column stood the statue of the happy prince. he was very much admired indeed. one night there flew over the city a little swallow. then when the autumn came they all flew away. what did he see the eyes of the happy prince were filled with tears and tears were running down his golden cheeks. his face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the little swallow was filled with pity. round the garden ran a very lofty wall but i never cared to ask what lay beyond it everything about me was so beautiful. my courtiers called me the happy prince and happy indeed i was if pleasure be happiness. so i lived and so i died. he was too polite to make any personal remarks out loud. one of the windows is open and through it i can see a woman seated at a table. his mother has nothing to give him but river water so he is crying. the king is there himself in his painted coffin. he passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing. at last he came to the poor house and looked in. then the swallow flew back to the happy prince and told him what he had done. and the little swallow began to think and then he fell asleep. thinking always made him sleepy. when day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath. when the moon rose he flew back to the happy prince. at noon the yellow lions come down to the waters edge to drink. pluck out one of them and take it to him. it was easy enough to get in as there was a hole in the roof. through this he darted and came into the room. dear prince i must leave you but i will never forget you and next spring i will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away. her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money and she is crying. she has no shoes or stockings and her little head is bare. then the swallow came back to the prince. all the next day he sat on the princes shoulder and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands. there is no mystery so great as misery. then he flew back and told the prince what he had seen. then the snow came and after the snow came the frost. but at last he knew that he was going to die. he had just strength to fly up to the princes shoulder once more. at that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue as if something had broken. it certainly was a dreadfully hard frost. so they pulled down the statue of the happy prince. if i bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn. if i bring her a red rose i shall hold her in my arms and she will lean her head upon my shoulder and her hand will be clasped in mine. but there is no red rose in my garden so i shall sit lonely and she will pass me by. surely love is a wonderful thing. she passed through the grove like a shadow and like a shadow she sailed across the garden. it is pleasant to sit in the green wood and to watch the sun in his chariot of gold and the moon in her chariot of pearl. she swept over the garden like a shadow and like a shadow she sailed through the grove. the young student was still lying on the grass where she had left him and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes. i am afraid not. she would not sacrifice herself for others. she thinks merely of music and everybody knows that the arts are selfish. still it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice. she sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl. then she gave one last burst of music. it floated through the reeds of the river and they carried its message to the sea. and at noon the student opened his window and looked out. i have never seen any rose like it in all my life. then he put on his hat and ran up to the professors house with the rose in his hand. only a student. the selfish giant. every afternoon as they were coming from school the children used to go and play in the giants garden. it was a large lovely garden with soft green grass. the birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them. when he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden. the poor children had now nowhere to play. they tried to play on the road but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones and they did not like it. they used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over and talk about the beautiful garden inside. then the spring came and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. only in the garden of the selfish giant it was still winter. the birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children and the trees forgot to blossom. the only people who were pleased were the snow and the frost. then they invited the north wind to stay with them and he came. he was dressed in grey and his breath was like ice. the autumn gave golden fruit to every garden but to the giants garden she gave none. so it was always winter there and the north wind and the hail and the frost and the snow danced about through the trees. one morning the giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music. what did he see he saw a most wonderful sight. through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in and they were sitting in the branches of the trees. in every tree that he could see there was a little child. and the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms and were waving their arms gently above the childrens heads. it was a lovely scene only in one corner it was still winter. he was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree and he was wandering all round it crying bitterly. the poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow and the north wind was blowing and roaring above it. and the giants heart melted as he looked out. so he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly and went out into the garden. but when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away and the garden became winter again. only the little boy did not run for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the giant coming. and the giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand and put him up into the tree. and the tree broke at once into blossom and the birds came and sang on it and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the giants neck and kissed him. and the other children when they saw that the giant was not wicked any longer came running back and with them came the spring. and when the people were going to market at twelve oclock they found the giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen. all day long they played and in the evening they came to the giant to bid him goodbye. but the children said that they did not know where he lived and had never seen him before and the giant felt very sad. every afternoon when school was over the children came and played with the giant. but the little boy whom the giant loved was never seen again. the giant was very kind to all the children yet he longed for his first little friend and often spoke of him. years went over and the giant grew very old and feeble. he did not hate the winter now for he knew that it was merely the spring asleep and that the flowers were resting. suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder and looked and looked. it certainly was a marvellous sight. its branches were all golden and silver fruit hung down from them and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved. downstairs ran the giant in great joy and out into the garden. he hastened across the grass and came near to the child. the devoted friend. but the little ducks paid no attention to her. they were so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in society at all. in fact i have never been married and i never intend to be. love is all very well in its way but friendship is much higher. he lived in a tiny cottage all by himself and every day he worked in his garden. in the winter also he was extremely lonely as the miller never came to see him then. that at least is my idea about friendship and i am sure i am right. it is quite a treat to hear you talk about friendship. you seem not to learn anything. i certainly will not allow hans nature to be spoiled. besides if hans came here he might ask me to let him have some flour on credit and that i could not do. flour is one thing and friendship is another and they should not be confused. that is the new method. that is the wonderful thing about it but i am afraid you dont understand the poetry of life. you dont mean to say you have sold it you see the winter was a very bad time for me and i really had no money at all to buy bread with. i know it is very generous of me and a great many people would think me extremely foolish for parting with it but i am not like the rest of the world. there is a very large hole in it and the corn will all get damp if i dont stop it up. how lucky you mentioned it so he jumped off the ladder and ran down the garden and looked over the wall. however he went on bravely and as last he reached the market. after he had waited there some time he sold the sack of flour for a very good price and then he returned home at once for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way. you must not mind my speaking quite plainly to you. of course i should not dream of doing so if i were not your friend. but what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means on no account cried little hans and he jumped out of bed and dressed himself and went up to the barn. they will come to you said the miller but you must take more pains. it took him the whole day to get there and back and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to sleep in his chair and did not wake up till it was broad daylight. it was a very wild night and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm. my little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself and i am going for the doctor. but he lives so far away and it is such a bad night that it has just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead of me. the night was so black that little hans could hardly see and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely stand. at last he lost his way and wandered off on the moor which was a very dangerous place as it was full of deep holes and there poor little hans was drowned. i will certainly take care not to give away anything again. and i quite agree with her. the remarkable rocket. he had waited a whole year for his bride and at last she had arrived. so pale was she that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered. when he saw her he sank upon one knee and kissed her hand. when the three days were over the marriage was celebrated. then there was a state banquet which lasted for five hours. the prince and princess sat at the top of the great hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal. after the banquet there was to be a ball. he played very badly but no one had ever dared to tell him so because he was the king. why i am very glad i have travelled. they wrote so much about it that nobody believed them and i am not surprised. it is like the moon and lives for ever. the bride and bridegroom for instance love each other very dearly. she was one of those people who think that if you say the same thing over and over a great many times it becomes true in the end. in fact he had a most distinguished manner. i am a very remarkable rocket and come of remarkable parents. he flew so high that the people were afraid that he would never come down again. you should be thinking about others. in fact you should be thinking about me. i am always thinking about myself and i expect everybody else to do the same. that is what is called sympathy. it is a beautiful virtue and i possess it in a high degree. suppose for instance anything happened to me tonight what a misfortune that would be for every one the prince and princess would never be happy again their whole married life would be spoiled and as for the king i know he would not get over it. why anybody can have common sense provided that they have no imagination. but i have imagination for i never think of things as they really are i always think of them as being quite different. fortunately for myself i dont care. but none of you have any hearts. there is nothing in you you are hollow and empty. what a terrible misfortune poor people to lose their only son it is really too dreadful if they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying anything more about the matter. then the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield and the stars began to shine and a sound of music came from the palace. the prince and princess were leading the dance. went the catherine wheel as she spun round and round. went the roman candle. every one was a great success except the remarkable rocket. he was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all. cried the court and the little princess laughed with pleasure. but they took no notice of him at all till they were just going away. then one of them caught sight of him. grand rocket that is what the man said. do you think it will be a wet afternoon he was very much annoyed that he could not get a word in. i am off to look for my daughters. i have six beautiful daughters and i am so afraid the pike may meet them. goodbye a second time i see my daughters in the distance and the little frog swam away. in fact you should take example by me you could not possibly have a better model. i am a great favourite at court in fact the prince and princess were married yesterday in my honour. i like hearing myself talk. however i dont care a bit. after some time a large white duck swam up to him. however i excuse your ignorance. a person of my position is never useful. there is neither society here nor solitude. however they did not seem to have much effect. i have not actually appeared myself but when i do so it will be a magnificent sight. gold stick that is what he said. the rocket was very damp so he took a long time to burn. at last however the fire caught him. and he went straight up into the air. there was no doubt about it. but nobody heard him not even the two little boys for they were sound asleep. then all that was left of him was the stick and this fell down on the back of a goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch. all the people throughout the city had heard of the wonderful property the cloth was to possess and all were anxious to learn how wise or how ignorant their neighbors might prove to be. i have never thought so myself and no one must know it now if i am so. no that must not be said either. what a splendid design this is indeed a terrible affair that would be the worst thing that could happen oh charming here is the mantle what colors how beautiful are our emperors new clothes certainly none of the emperors various suits had ever made so great an impression as these invisible ones. the emperor was vexed for he knew that the people were right but he thought the procession must go on now his kingdom was very small but still quite large enough to marry upon and he wished to marry. listen that was delightful the pot was boiling the whole evening and the whole of the following day. ah he travelled all over the world in hopes of finding such a lady but there was always something wrong. princesses he found in plenty but whether they were real princesses it was impossible for him to decide for now one thing now another seemed to him not quite right about the ladies. at last he returned to his palace quite cast down because he wished so much to have a real princess for his wife. all at once there was heard a violent knocking at the door and the old king the princes father went out himself to open it. it was a princess who was standing outside the door. she said she was a real princess. upon this bed the princess was to pass the night. the next morning she was asked how she had slept. i do not know what was in my bed but i had something hard under me and am all over black and blue. none but a real princess could have had such a delicate sense of feeling. the prince accordingly made her his wife being now convinced that he had found a real princess. wasnt this a lady of real delicacy in one of the houses not far from the new market a party was invited a very large party in order as is often the case to get a return invitation from the others. here sat two female figures a young and an old one.  but what she had yet to perform was something quite unusual. ii. this is too bad the principal person in the procession was a priest. not one was to be seen. it was a huge desolate plain some wild bushes stood up here and there while across the field flowed a broad canal or river. i shall speak about it at the first opportunity. i have half a mind to go back again and say what i suffer. oh i am ill i can scarcely bear myself any longer. it must be here on this very spot yet there is not the slightest idea of resemblance to such a degree has everything changed this night at all events here are some people up and stirring. oh oh so far all went on well. he did so but just as he was going the others remarked what he was about they laid hold of him by the legs and now happily for him off fell his fatal shoes and with them the charm was at an end. all seemed to him in proper order as usual it was east street splendid and elegant as we now see it. he lay with his feet towards a doorway and exactly opposite sat the watchman asleep. yes tis east street how splendid and light it is iii. thats a happy fellow and if one then marks down ones thoughts poetry is produced. but here was written
                  oh were i rich oh were i rich and the time came and officer was i but yet i grew not rich. alas poor me have pity thou who all mans wants dost see. then was i rich but not in gold poor me as thou dost know who all mens hearts canst see. she is so pretty clever and so kind      oh did she know whats hidden in my mind 
       a tale of old. would she to me were kind but im condemned to silence oh poor me as thou dost know who all mens hearts canst see. dark is the future now. alas poor me he has a home a wife and children who weep with him over his sorrows who rejoice with him when he is glad. so then the watchman was again watchman. when we die so at least says the student for whom my wife does the washing we shall fly about as light as a feather from one such a star to the other. now just listen to what happened to the watchman. they had a language too but surely nobody can expect that the soul of the watchman should understand it. the watchmans spirit understood the language of the inhabitants of the moon pretty well. now that would be a very pretty joke if the spirit when it came back and looked for the body in east street were not to find one. it took its direction towards the body in a straight line and a few seconds after life began to show itself in the man. iv. well there he stood. but now the rest of the body was to be got through oh for his neck there was room enough but for nothing more. the shoes of fortune had placed him in the most dreadful situation and unfortunately it never occurred to him to wish himself free. how was he to twist himself through i shall go wild i know not what to do. oh but you must not think that the affair is over now it grows much worse. the night passed the next day also but nobody came to fetch the shoes. he begged permission of the worthy audience and set his spectacles on his nose. this was an excellent opportunity to have said something clever. ah he was now in the heart of the wife of this worthy gentleman. but he was mistaken. it was the heart of a young military man a man as people said of talent and feeling. in the greatest perplexity he now came out of the last heart in the row he was unable to put his thoughts in order and fancied that his too lively imagination had run away with him. and why i should like to know are the police never to be wrong so he put them on quickly stuck his papers in his pocket and took besides a few under his arm intending to look them through at home to make the necessary notes. it was noon and the weather that had threatened rain began to clear up while gaily dressed holiday folks filled the streets. each one kept to his own opinion and so they separated. o heavens tis a long time since i have thought on those times. the good old soul she lived behind the exchange. such is my fate what is come to me never have i thought or felt like this before wonderful very wonderful and this what have i here close by stood a boy who dashed his stick into a wet ditch. yes he observed it perfectly and laughed in his heart. the shoes as is the case with anybody who does what he has to do properly could only attend to one thing at a time. unfortunately the pleasure lasted but a moment. for today however she would allow it and they must shut him in the empty cage that was standing in the window. i am well fed and get friendly treatment. i know i am a clever fellow and that is all i care about. come let us be men. for this they have covered you over they never do the like to me for i cost more. can a dog or a horse laugh no but they can cry. the gift of laughing was given to man alone. ha ha it is no doubt cold enough in your woods but there at least is the breath of liberty therefore fly away. in the hurry they have forgotten to shut your cage and the upper window is open. fly my friend fly away. at last he was forced to rest a little. the neighboring house had a something familiar about it a window stood open he flew in it was his own room. he perched upon the table. after all that was a very unpleasant disagreeable dream that haunted me it was his neighbor a young divine who lived on the same floor. he walked in. that is the highest aim of all my wishes but it must be far far away in short he was travelling. it began to snow a cold wind blew and roared as though it were seeking a bride. one of the travellers kept watch while the others slept. how close it was in the chamber i want something better than what is but what is fled in an instant. but what is it and where is it to be found yet i know in reality what it is i wish for. oh they both bent over the corpse. the fir tree 
out in the woods stood a nice little fir tree. in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hare would often come leaping along and jump right over the little tree. oh that made him so angry where did they go to what became of them but how does the sea look in reality when christmas came quite young trees were cut down trees which often were not even as large or of the same age as this fir tree who could never rest but always wanted to be off. we know whither they are taken what a longing do i suffer were christmas but come i am now tall and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year oh were i but already on the cart oh how i long how i suffer the departure was not at all agreeable. oh what was to happen it was really splendid beyond description splendid. and then i wonder what will happen perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to look at me the candles were now lighted what brightness what splendor now the tree did not even dare tremble. what a state he was in the older persons followed quietly the little ones stood quite still. so they fell upon it with such violence that all its branches cracked if it had not been fixed firmly in the ground it would certainly have tumbled down. but i shall tell only one story. and the children clapped their hands and cried. the fir tree stood quite still and absorbed in thought the birds in the wood had never related the like of this. yes yes there stood the tree quite hidden it seemed as if he had been entirely forgotten. how thoughtful that is how kind man is after all if it only were not so dark here and so terribly lonely not even a hare and out in the woods it was so pleasant when the snow was on the ground and the hare leaped by yes even when he jumped over me but i did not like it then and then another little one came. have you never been there how much you have seen so then the fir tree told the whole fairy tale for he could remember every single word of it and the little mice jumped for joy up to the very top of the tree. next night two more mice came and on sunday two rats even but they said the stories were not interesting which vexed the little mice and they too now began to think them not so very amusing either. now that too is over. all passed so quickly there was so much going on around him the tree quite forgot to look to himself. one of the youngest ran and tore off the golden star. each sigh was like a shot. the boys played about in the court and the youngest wore the gold star on his breast which the tree had had on the happiest evening of his life. however that was over now the tree gone the story at an end. all all was over every tale must end at last. the snow queen 
first story. when we are at the end of the story we shall know more than we know now but to begin. so then they thought they would fly up to the sky and have a joke there. this happened because the very smallest bit had the same power which the whole mirror had possessed. other pieces were put in spectacles and that was a sad affair when people put on their glasses to see well and rightly. second story. they were not brother and sister but they cared for each other as much as if they were. their parents lived exactly opposite. in winter there was an end of this pleasure. his name was kay hers was gerda. she is the largest of all and she can never remain quietly on the earth but goes up again into the black clouds. the little boy was frightened and jumped down from the chair it seemed to him as if at the same moment a large bird flew past the window. it was just one of those pieces of glass from the magic mirror that had got into his eye and poor kay had got another piece right in his heart. it will soon become like ice. it did not hurt any longer but there it was. theres nothing the matter with me. and look this one is quite crooked after all these roses are very ugly his games now were quite different to what they had formerly been they were so very knowing. it was so capital it was a lady her cloak and cap were of snow. it was the snow queen. ah the snow queen kissed kay once more and then he forgot little gerda grandmother and all whom he had left at his home. third story. where could he be nobody knew nobody could give any intelligence. nobody knew where he was many sad tears were shed and little gerda wept long and bitterly at last she said he must be dead that he had been drowned in the river which flowed close to the town. oh at last spring came with its warm sunshine. she rose and looked for many hours at the beautiful green banks. gerda called to them for she thought they were alive but they of course did not answer. she came close to them for the stream drifted the boat quite near the land. gerda called still louder and an old woman then came out of the cottage leaning upon a crooked stick. and gerda was so glad to be on dry land again but she was rather afraid of the strange old woman. she then took gerda by the hand led her into the little cottage and locked the door. the old woman feared that if gerda should see the roses she would then think of her own would remember little kay and run away from her. the next morning she went to play with the flowers in the warm sunshine and thus passed away a day. gerda knew every flower and numerous as they were it still seemed to gerda that one was wanting though she did not know which. one day while she was looking at the hat of the old woman painted with flowers the most beautiful of them all seemed to her to be a rose. but so it is when ones thoughts are not collected. gerda kissed the roses thought of her own dear roses at home and with them of little kay. those are the only two tones. how her silken robe is rustling the robe of the one was red that of the second blue and that of the third white. do the dancing maidens sleep or are they dead oh is little kay really dead it was one that said nothing about kay either. she knows her grandmother. but i will soon come home and then i will bring kay with me. and what did it say she looked round her thrice but no one followed her. at last she could run no longer she sat down on a large stone and when she looked about her she saw that the summer had passed it was late in the autumn but that one could not remark in the beautiful garden where there was always sunshine and where there were flowers the whole year round. fourth story. good day he could not say it better but he felt a sympathy for the little girl and asked her where she was going all alone. he moved his head backwards and forwards and flew away. the evening was closing in when the raven returned. she took it out of the kitchen where there is bread enough. you are hungry no doubt. oh how gerdas heart beat with anxiety and longing it was just as if she had been about to do something wrong and yet she only wanted to know if little kay was there. yes he must be there. they were now on the stairs. a single lamp was burning there and on the floor stood the tame raven turning her head on every side and looking at gerda who bowed as her grandmother had taught her to do. if you will take the lamp i will go before. one was white and in this lay the princess the other was red and it was here that gerda was to look for little kay. she bent back one of the red leaves and saw a brown neck. oh that was kay she called him quite loud by name held the lamp towards him the dreams rushed back again into the chamber he awoke turned his head and it was not little kay the prince was only like him about the neck but he was young and handsome. and out of the white lily leaves the princess peeped too and asked what was the matter. however they should have a reward. the next day she was dressed from head to foot in silk and velvet. they offered to let her stay at the palace and lead a happy life but she begged to have a little carriage with a horse in front and for a small pair of shoes then she said she would again go forth in the wide world and look for kay. the raven of the woods who was now married accompanied her for the first three miles. fifth story. at length the carriage stopped. in the midst of the large old smoking hall burnt a great fire on the stone floor. the poor animal kicked the girl laughed and pulled gerda into bed with her. the robbers sat round the fire sang and drank and the old female robber jumped about so that it was quite dreadful for gerda to see her. we have seen little kay she blew upon us young ones and all died except we two. but i do not wish you to be cold. on with them sixth story. she read it three times she then knew it by heart so she put the fish into the cupboard for it might very well be eaten and she never threw anything away. dont you see how great it is she must not hear of her power from us that power lies in her heart because she is a sweet and innocent child if she cannot get to the snow queen by herself and rid little kay of the glass we cannot help her. two miles hence the garden of the snow queen begins thither you may carry the little girl. i have not got my boots she ran on as fast as she could. little gerda repeated the lords prayer. the cold was so intense that she could see her own breath which came like smoke out of her mouth. the angels patted her hands and feet and then she felt the cold less and went on quickly towards the palace of the snow queen. he never thought of gerda and least of all that she was standing before the palace. seventh story. what took place in the palace of the snow queen and what happened afterward. the walls of the palace were of driving snow and the windows and doors of cutting winds. in the middle of this lake sat the snow queen when she was at home and then she said she was sitting in the mirror of understanding and that this was the only one and the best thing in the world. little kay was quite blue yes nearly black with cold but he did not observe it for she had kissed away all feeling of cold from his body and his heart was a lump of ice. where have you been so long they took each other by the hand and wandered forth out of the large hall they talked of their old grandmother and of the roses upon the roof and wherever they went the winds ceased raging and the sun burst forth. it was the little robber maiden who tired of being at home had determined to make a journey to the north and afterwards in another direction if that did not please her. she recognised gerda immediately and gerda knew her too. it was a joyful meeting. they entered and hastened up to their grandmothers room where everything was standing as formerly. he had exquisite manners and bowed to the company on all sides for he had noble blood and was moreover accustomed to the society of man alone and that makes a great difference. he made a jump all on one side into the lap of the princess who was sitting on a little golden stool close by. he had gone out and got his feet wet though nobody could imagine how it had happened for it was quite dry weather. pay attention i know the date said she but those below did not hear her for they were talking about old times. i thought you were dead and gone and lying down in the deep waters. many a night have i got up to see if the wind had not changed and changed it had sure enough but you never came. it was from you i opened it instantly and read i laughed and wept. i was so happy. what a blessed land that must be at the same moment came someone who embraced me. good heavens what weather it was and what a state the street was in and then we had our first little boy and then mary and nicholas and peter and christian. they looked at each other and held one another by the hand. oh it was wondrous beautiful the animal was strong and handsome and away they went at full gallop round the lawn. and now we are close to the church. away away nothing could be more charming. first they shone like silver then like gold and when they laid them on the heads of the old people each flower became a golden crown. and it seemed to both of them it contained much that resembled their own history and those parts that were like it pleased them best. i can remember i can tell things they closed their eyes and and  yes thats the end of the story the little boy lay in his bed he did not know if he had dreamed or not or if he had been listening while someone told him the story. and the old man who had been talking was just on the point of going out at the door and he did go. those persons who were walking outside the town where the houses were farther apart with gardens or little fields between them could see the evening sky still better and heard the sound of the bell much more distinctly. many persons now went to the wood for the sake of getting the place but one only returned with a sort of explanation for nobody went far enough that one not further than the others. however he said that the sound proceeded from a very large owl in a hollow tree a sort of learned owl that continually knocked its head against the branches. they all immediately felt a wish to go thither all except three. there were three therefore that did not go the others hastened on. the sun shone the birds sang and the children sang too and each held the other by the hand for as yet they had none of them any high office and were all of equal rank in the eye of god. was it that which people had heard both knew each other the boy was that one among the children who could not come because he had to go home and return his jacket and boots to the innkeepers son. this he had done and was now going on in wooden shoes and in his humble dress for the bell sounded with so deep a tone and with such strange power that proceed he must. and there were large calm lakes there too in which white swans were swimming and beat the air with their wings. the kings son often stood still and listened. he thought the bell sounded from the depths of these still lakes but then he remarked again that the tone proceeded not from there but farther off from out the depths of the forest. how magnificent was the sight from this height the sea the great the glorious sea that dashed its long waves against the coast was stretched out before him. and yonder where sea and sky meet stood the sun like a large shining altar all melted together in the most glowing colors. he had followed his own path and had reached the spot just as soon as the son of the king had done. the steps are as broad as those of a palace and as high as to a church tower. will you give this to the old man over the way from me afterwards there came a message it was to ask if the little boy himself had not a wish to come over and pay a visit and so he got permission of his parents and then went over to the old house. the little boy comes yes that was a picture book i cannot bear it any longer here it is not at all as it is over the way at your home where your father and mother spoke so pleasantly and where you and all your sweet children made such a delightful noise. nay how lonely the old man is do you think that he gets kisses do you think he gets mild eyes or a christmas tree he will get nothing but a grave there is the little boy it was exactly like the first time for over there one day and hour was just like another. it is too melancholy it would at least be a change. i cannot bear it longer now i know what it is to have a visit from ones old thoughts with what they may bring with them tell me something about little mary yes he is happy enough thats sure what became of him the old man sought and the little boy sought he was away and he stayed away. that day passed and the little boy went home and that week passed and several weeks too. he was driven out there but no one followed all his friends were dead and the little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was driven away. in the spring they pulled the house down for as people said it was a ruin. and then it was put to rights. oh what was that she had stuck herself. it was yes guess he laughed and then shook his head. they themselves knew not how old they were but they could remember very well that there had been many more that they were of a family from foreign lands and that for them and theirs the whole forest was planted. now they lived a very lonely and happy life and as they had no children themselves they had adopted a little common snail which they brought up as their own but the little one would not grow for he was of a common family but the old ones especially dame mother snail thought they could observe how he increased in size and she begged father if he could not see it that he would at least feel the little snails shell and then he felt it and found the good dame was right. one day there was a heavy storm of rain. you will see that it will be wet here i am very happy to think that we have our good house and the little one has his also there is more done for us than for all other creatures sure enough but can you not see that we are folks of quality in the world there need not however be any haste about that but you are always in such a tremendous hurry and the little one is beginning to be the same. but have you not thought of it where shall we get a wife for him and then the marriage was celebrated. the story of a mother 
a mother sat there with her little child. and the mother looked down in her lap and the tears ran down over her cheeks her head became so heavy she had not closed her eyes for three days and nights and now she slept but only for a minute when she started up and trembled with cold. and then the clock also stood still. but the poor mother ran out of the house and cried aloud for her child. i am fond of them. she then came to a large lake where there was neither ship nor boat. many flowers and trees have withered this night death will soon come and plant them over again but the distressed mother bent down over all the smallest plants and heard within them how the human heart beat and amongst millions she knew her childs. then he will be afraid and death stretched out his long hand towards the fine little flower but she held her hands fast around his so tight and yet afraid that she should touch one of the leaves. tell it me save the innocent save my child from all that misery rather take it away take it into gods kingdom hear me not i feel quite hot. i am quite changed. you will burn a hole in me. oh how well you can stretch your legs out it is the most graceful performance i have ever seen. you should have seen me then you should have seen me when i lay down but now it was only to the hot lands that a learned man had come from the cold there he thought that he could run about just as when at home but he soon found out his mistake. the narrow street with the high houses was built so that the sunshine must fall there from morning till evening it was really not to be borne.  it was lively both up and down the street. for they too had bells on. the door opposite was also opened late in the evening but it was dark within at least in the front room further in there was heard the sound of music. i shall master it yet it was like a piece of enchantment. and who lived there where was the actual entrance the light burnt in the room behind him and thus it was quite natural that his shadow should fall on his opposite neighbors wall. yes come now now yes so then it has actually gone last night and not come again. he made himself little he made himself great but no shadow came again. in the course of three weeks he had a very fair shadow which when he set out for his home in the northern lands grew more and more in the journey so that at last it was so long and so large that it was more than sufficient. the learned man then came home and he wrote books about what was true in the world and about what was good and what was beautiful and there passed days and years yes many years passed away. one evening as he was sitting in his room there was a gentle knocking at the door. i have got so much body. i have even got flesh and clothes. you certainly never thought of seeing me so well off. do you not know your old shadow you certainly thought i should never more return. things have gone on well with me since i was last with you. i have in all respects become very well off. as soon as you found i was capable to go out alone in the world i went my own way. i am in the most brilliant circumstances but there came a sort of desire over me to see you once more before you die you will die i suppose i also wished to see this land again for you know we always love our native land. i know you have got another shadow again have i anything to pay to it or you make thyself as free as anyone else. i was there for three weeks and that has as much effect as if one had lived three thousand years and read all that was composed and written that is what i say and it is right. yes i have seen her a single short moment but sleep came into my eyes father and mother sister and brother say thou to one another without regard to age or rank. was it there as in a holy church had you come over there you would not have been a man but i became so i became a man i took my way i tell it to you but you will not put it in any book i took my way to the cake woman i hid myself behind her the woman didnt think how much she concealed. this is in fact a base world i would not be a man if it were not now once accepted and regarded as something to be so had i written a newspaper it would have been read and so i became the man i am. and i now bid you farewell. years and days passed away then the shadow came again. you do not understand the world. you will become ill by it. you must travel i should like to have a travelling companion will you go with me as shadow will you be my shadow he was quite ill at last. you as a learned man certainly know how strange nature is. i just happen to have a very unusual shadow do you not see that person who always goes with me other persons have a common shadow but i do not like what is common to all. in our time water has wonderful powers. but i shall not leave the place for it now begins to be amusing here. she felt such respect for what he knew that is just as important so she went to the learned man by the door and she spoke to him about the sun and the moon and about persons out of and in the world and he answered with wisdom and prudence. now they were in the country where the princess reigned when she was at home. it is to deceive the whole country and the princess too i will tell everything and the soldiers presented arms. that was a marriage when she left home she had slippers on it is true but what was the good of that so the little maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet that were quite red and blue from cold. she carried a quantity of matches in an old apron and she held a bundle of them in her hand. she crept along trembling with cold and hunger a very picture of sorrow the poor little thing oh a match might afford her a world of comfort if she only dared take a single one out of the bundle draw it against the wall and warm her fingers by it. she drew one out. it was a warm bright flame like a candle as she held her hands over it it was a wonderful light. she rubbed another against the wall it burned brightly and where the light fell on the wall there the wall became transparent like a veil so that she could see into the room. she lighted another match. the little maiden stretched out her hands towards them when the match went out. the lights of the christmas tree rose higher and higher she saw them now as stars in heaven one fell down and formed a long trail of fire. she took the little maiden on her arm and both flew in brightness and in joy so high so very high and then above was neither cold nor hunger nor anxiety they were with god. but in the corner at the cold hour of dawn sat the poor girl with rosy cheeks and with a smiling mouth leaning against the wall frozen to death on the last evening of the old year. he ought to be sure to have read over his lesson again but that you know he could not do. now he said that there were just as many inhabitants as he had nails in his body and he was very proud.  plump one solitary tower only and some remains of a wall show where the castle once stood. again all suddenly disappeared. yes and whither it seemed to him just as if one turned over a leaf in a book. my town is just like a bottle and one gets in by the neck and by the neck one must get out again the latter lives there still. so very large you will suffer neither hunger nor thirst you will get on in the world you will be a rich and happy man you understand what i mean. it was bright day and he was now quite unable to call to mind his dream that however was not at all necessary for one may not know what the future will bring. and out of bed he jumped and read in his book and now all at once he knew his whole lesson. the naughty boy 
along time ago there lived an old poet a thoroughly kind old poet. let me in he looked exactly like a little angel but he was so pale and his whole body trembled with cold. the old poet seated himself beside his hearth and took the little fellow on his lap he squeezed the water out of his dripping hair warmed his hands between his own and boiled for him some sweet wine. then the boy recovered his cheeks again grew rosy he jumped down from the lap where he was sitting and danced round the kind old poet. the naughty boy to shoot the old poet in that way he who had taken him into his warm room who had treated him so kindly and who had given him warm wine and the very best apples the poor poet lay on the earth and wept for the arrow had really flown into his heart. yes he is forever following people. ask them only and you will hear what theyll tell you. he is forever running after everybody. only think he shot an arrow once at your old grandmother they were meant for the little girl. the little girl was called karen. on the very day her mother was buried karen received the red shoes and wore them for the first time. nothing in the world can be compared with red shoes. the rich shoemaker in the city took the measure of her little foot. all this looked charming but the old lady could not see well and so had no pleasure in them. in the midst of the shoes stood a pair of red ones just like those the princess had worn. how beautiful they were the shoemaker said also they had been made for the child of a count but had not fitted. yet such was the case. in the afternoon the old lady heard from everyone that the shoes had been red and she said that it was very wrong of karen that it was not at all becoming and that in future karen should only go in black shoes to church even when she should be older. and karen stretched out her little foot. she danced round the church corner she could not leave off the coachman was obliged to run after and catch hold of her and he lifted her in the carriage but her feet continued to dance so that she trod on the old lady dreadfully. at length she took the shoes off and then her legs had peace. the shoes were placed in a closet at home but karen could not avoid looking at them. now the old lady was sick and it was said she could not recover. but there was a great ball in the city to which karen was invited. she looked at the old lady who could not recover she looked at the red shoes and she thought there could be no sin in it she put on the red shoes she might do that also she thought. but then she went to the ball and began to dance. when she wanted to dance to the right the shoes would dance to the left and when she wanted to dance up the room the shoes danced back again down the steps into the street and out of the city gate. she danced and was forced to dance straight out into the gloomy wood. and she danced and must dance over fields and meadows in rain and sunshine by night and day but at night it was the most fearful. he wore long white garments he had wings which reached from his shoulders to the earth his countenance was severe and grave and in his hand he held a sword broad and glittering. dance shalt thou from door to door and where proud vain children dwell thou shalt knock that they may hear thee and tremble one morning she danced past a door which she well knew. then she knew that the old lady was dead and felt that she was abandoned by all and condemned by the angel of god. she danced and she was forced to dance through the gloomy night. come out and he touched the ceiling with the spray and the ceiling rose so high and where he had touched it there gleamed a golden star. for the church itself had come to the poor girl in her narrow chamber or else she had come into the church. her heart was so full of sunshine peace and joy that it broke. her soul flew on the sunshine to god and there no one asked after the red shoes. the gardener as you have heard already had a son who was a very handsome young man with most agreeable manners and every day he carried the best fruit of the garden to the king and all the prettiest flowers to his daughter. now this princess was wonderfully pretty and was just sixteen years old and the king was beginning to think it was time that she should be married. on hearing this the king was at first very angry and then he wept and sighed and declared that such a husband was not worthy of his daughter but the young princess was not to be turned from her resolution to marry the gardeners son. he traveled on for some days and presently reached a fountain beside which an old woman all in rags sat upon a stone. but the ministers son made no reply. that same evening the gardeners son rode up to the fountain upon his lame gray horse. go out of the town by the south gate and there you will find three little dogs of different colors the first will be white the second black the third red. then arrange the bones in their proper places and throw over them the ashes out of the three bags. the king will come back to life and will be just as he was when he was twenty years old. for your reward you must demand the bronze ring which has the power to grant you everything you desire. on going out of the town he found the white red and black dogs and killed and burnt them gathering the ashes in three bags. as to the poor princess she was sorrowful and angry enough about it. the king happened at that moment to be at the palace window. i cannot give your daughter away. several months passed. really they were quite wonderfully pretty. there were mice everywhere and nothing but mice. then the queen of the mice held a council. that is that you shall first bring me back a bronze ring which some clever magician has stolen from me. suddenly three mice arrived from a very distant country. when they reached the capital they landed and ran to the palace leaving only the blind mouse on the shore to take care of the boat. then they waited till it was night. the wicked old man lay down in bed and put the bronze ring into his mouth and very soon he was asleep. imagine the despair of the magician when he awoke and the bronze ring was nowhere to be found but by that time our three mice had set sail with their prize. naturally they began to talk about the bronze ring. the boat reached the island and the mice landed. the blind mouse was speedily deserted by her two sisters who went off to hunt flies but as she wandered sadly along the shore she found a dead fish and was eating it when she felt something very hard. at her cries the other two mice ran up. ah at last the port was reached. the captain landed and ran to the palace where he found the wicked old man asleep. so the king set out to seek a fairy and asked what he could do to win the princesss love. the king took a long step and quite thought he had the tail under his foot but the cat turned round so sharply that he only trod on air. and so it went on for eight days till the king began to think that this fatal tail must be full of quicksilver it was never still for a moment. so the king without losing a moment set his foot upon it heavily. the little prince had large blue eyes the prettiest eyes in the world and a sweet little mouth but alas his nose was so enormous that it covered half his face. he rode up to it and saw a little old woman who appeared to be at least a hundred years old. i loved your father as if he had been my brother. but never mind one may be a very worthy man though his nose is too long. i was telling you that i was your fathers friend he often came to see me in the old times and you must know that i was very pretty in those days at least he used to say so. they used to tell the queen my mother that it was so. for though you see what i am now i was the daughter of a great king. how stupid people are not to see their own faults for my part i never will be taken in by them. ah thanks. now let us speak of your father. when i went to his court he was only a little boy but that is forty years ago and i have been in this desolate place ever since. tell me what goes on nowadays are the ladies as fond of amusement as ever dear me what a long nose you have it cannot matter to you what it is like. however though i really cannot help your nose being a shock to me i will try not to say anything about it. i will even try to think that you have an ordinary nose. the old fairy who wished to make him happy at last hit upon a plan. she shut the dear little princess up in a palace of crystal and put this palace down where the prince would not fail to find it. his joy at seeing the princess again was extreme and he set to work with all his might to try to break her prison but in spite of all his efforts he failed utterly. in despair he thought at least that he would try to get near enough to speak to the dear little princess who on her part stretched out her hand that he might kiss it but turn which way he might he never could raise it to his lips for his long nose always prevented it. much good it was for me to talk to you about your nose he married the dear little princess and they lived happily ever after. the man went out to see what could be the matter and when he got out there stood a great big white bear. little enough had she to take away with her. she seated herself on his back with her bundle and thus they departed. and thus she rode far far away until they came to a great mountain. the white bear gave her a silver bell and told her that when she needed anything she had but to ring this bell and what she wanted would appear. so after she had eaten and night was drawing near she grew sleepy after her journey and thought she would like to go to bed. she rang the bell and scarcely had she touched it before she found herself in a chamber where a bed stood ready made for her which was as pretty as anyone could wish to sleep in. she never saw him however for he always came after she had put out her light and went away before daylight appeared. so all went well and happily for a time but then she began to be very sad and sorrowful for all day long she had to go about alone and she did so wish to go home to her father and mother and brothers and sisters. then the white bear asked what it was that she wanted and she told him that it was so dull there in the mountain and that she had to go about all alone and that in her parents house at home there were all her brothers and sisters and it was because she could not go to them that she was so sorrowful. everyone thought that he could never be sufficiently grateful to her for all she had done for them all. now they had everything that they wanted and everything was as good as it could be. they all asked her how she was getting on where she was. all was well with her too she said and she had everything that she could want. what other answers she gave i cannot say but i am pretty sure that they did not learn much from her. her mother wanted to talk with her alone in her own chamber. but she remembered what the white bear had said and would on no account go. but somehow or other her mother at last persuaded her and she was forced to tell the whole story. but i will teach you a way to see him. you shall have a bit of one of my candles which you can take away with you hidden in your breast. if you had but held out for the space of one year i should have been free. i have a stepmother who has bewitched me so that i am a white bear by day and a man by night but now all is at an end between you and me and i must leave you and go to her. then she asked him if she could not go with him. but no that could not be. so when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes and wept till she was weary she set out on her way and thus she walked for many and many a long day until at last she came to a great mountain. outside it an aged woman was sitting playing with a golden apple. of this woman too she inquired if she knew the way to the prince and where to find the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon. but it was only the same thing once again. so she did this and journeyed to the south wind neither was she very long on the way. when they had got there the west wind asked him if he could tell her the way to the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon for she was the girl who ought to marry the prince who lived there. if you like however i will go with you to my brother the north wind he is the oldest and strongest of all of us and if he does not know where it is no one in the whole world will be able to tell you. down below there was such a storm and thus they tore on and on and a long time went by and then yet more time passed and still they were above the sea and the north wind grew tired and more tired and at last so utterly weary that he was scarcely able to blow any longer and he sank and sank lower and lower until at last he went so low that the waves dashed against the heels of the poor girl he was carrying. next morning she sat down beneath the walls of the castle to play with the golden apple and the first person she saw was the maiden with the long nose who was to have the prince. so the princess got the golden apple but when the girl went up to the princes apartment that night he was asleep for the princess had so contrived it. the princess asked her what she wanted for it and she replied that it was not for sale either for gold or money but that if she could get leave to go to the prince and be with him during the night she should have it. but when she went up to the princes room he was again asleep and let her call him or shake him or weep as she would he still slept on and she could not put any life in him. when daylight came in the morning the princess with the long nose came too and once more drove her away. so she opened the window and asked what she would take for it. the girl said what she had said on each of the former occasions that it was not for sale either for gold or for money but if she could get leave to go to the prince who lived there and be with him during the night she should have it. so when the girl went into the princes room this time he was awake and she had to tell him how she had come there. the princess with the long nose began to wash as well as she could but the more she washed and rubbed the larger the spots grew. so she came in. 1

the yellow dwarf 
once upon a time there lived a queen who had been the mother of a great many children and of them all only one daughter was left. but then she was worth at least a thousand. her mother who since the death of the king her father had nothing in the world she cared for so much as this little princess was so terribly afraid of losing her that she quite spoiled her and never tried to correct any of her faults. when they saw this portrait they fell in love with the princess every one of them but upon each it had a different effect. how could they when they knew that any of them might have cut off his head five or six times a day just to please her and she would have thought it a mere trifle so little did she care this cake she prepared with her own hands and putting it in a little basket she set out to seek the fairy. but as she was not used to walking far she soon felt very tired and sat down at the foot of a tree to rest and presently fell fast asleep. the cake was all gone and to make matters worse at that moment she heard the roaring of the great lions who had found out that she was near and were coming to look for her. but when it was time to go on again the basket had disappeared and though she looked everywhere not a trace of it could she find. the more she hunted for it the more frightened she got and at last she began to cry. then all at once she saw before her the yellow dwarf. no. im sure she has not. she would have told me if she had. i have looked at you enough. i am so frightened. at last the chief men of the kingdom anxious to see their princess married sent to the queen to beg her to choose a husband for her as soon as possible. now he was a very handsome and powerful prince who had been in love with the princess for years but had not thought that she would ever care about him at all. at least that is what the king of the gold mines thought and he was never happy unless he was with her. as for the princess the more she saw of the king the more she liked him he was so generous so handsome and clever that at last she was almost as much in love with him as he was with her. how happy they were as they wandered about in the beautiful gardens together sometimes listening to sweet music this is one that she liked very much
  in the forest all is gay   when my princess walks that way. oh they really were as happy as the day was long. they said goodby to the princess so sadly that she could not help being sorry for them. at last the happy day came. you may imagine how much these had cost but then nothing could have been more brilliant except the beauty of the princess upon her head she wore a splendid crown her lovely hair waved nearly to her feet and her stately figure could easily be distinguished among all the ladies who attended her. ho ho princess your quarrel is with me only. i am your enemy and your rival. this new misfortune was the work of the wicked fairy of the desert who had come with the yellow dwarf to help him carry off the princess and had fallen in love with the handsome young king of the gold mines directly she saw him. now the fairy was so clever that she could not only seem beautiful to the king but even the poor princess thought her the most lovely being she had ever seen. must i also be made to know that the king of the gold mines ceased to love me as soon as he lost sight of me the fairy came back so delighted that she could not conceal her joy. alas alas why is my princess snatched from me and then the mermaid caught up the king and away they swam joyfully together. here she was received by the prettiest girls it was possible to find who had been carried there by the yellow dwarf who hastened to wait upon her and showed her every possible attention. we must now go back to the fairy of the desert. when she found that the king did not return she hastened out to look for him and reached the shore with a hundred of the ladies of her train loaded with splendid presents for him. struck with astonishment and sorrow she uttered a terrible cry and threw herself down beside the pretended king weeping and howling and calling upon her eleven sisters who were also fairies and who came to her assistance. for no sooner had he flashed it before their eyes than down they fell at his feet quite helpless and he killed them with one blow. now he hoped his difficulties were over but at the next turning he was met by one which he did not know how to overcome. we beg you not to insist upon going on. strike she was seated by the brook looking pale and weary when he reached her and he would have thrown himself down at her feet but she drew herself away from him with as much indignation as if he had been the yellow dwarf. let me explain everything. but alas the poor princess seeing her lover lying dead at her feet could no longer live without him she sank down by him and died of a broken heart. so ended these unfortunate lovers whom not even the mermaid could help because all the magic power had been lost with the diamond sword. this good woman had made for her a little red ridinghood which became the girl so extremely well that everybody called her little red ridinghood. he asked her whither she was going. the wolf was not long before he got to the old womans house. he knocked at the door tap tap. he then shut the door and went into the grandmothers bed expecting little red ridinghood who came some time afterward and knocked at the door tap tap. the sleeping beauty in the wood 
there were formerly a king and a queen who were so sorry that they had no children so sorry that it cannot be expressed. at last however the queen had a daughter. but as they were all sitting down at table they saw come into the hall a very old fairy whom they had not invited because it was above fifty years since she had been out of a certain tower and she was believed to be either dead or enchanted. in the meanwhile all the fairies began to give their gifts to the princess. the good old woman not knowing very well what to do in this affair cried out for help. the fairy came away immediately and she arrived about an hour after in a fiery chariot drawn by dragons. immediately upon her touching them they all fell asleep that they might not awake before their mistress and that they might be ready to wait upon her when she wanted them. all this was done in a moment. fairies are not long in doing their business. everyone answered according as they had heard. the common opinion was that an ogre lived there and that he carried thither all the little children he could catch that he might eat them up at his leisure without anybody being able to follow him as having himself only the power to pass through the wood. after that he went through several rooms full of gentlemen and ladies all asleep some standing others sitting. he approached with trembling and admiration and fell down before her upon his knees. in short they talked four hours together and yet they said not half what they had to say. the chief lady of honor being as sharp set as other folks grew very impatient and told the princess aloud that supper was served up. they had but very little sleep the princess had no occasion and the prince left her next morning to return to the city where his father must needs have been in pain for him. the queen spoke several times to her son to inform herself after what manner he did pass his time and that in this he ought in duty to satisfy her. and so the prince would never tell her one word. but when the king was dead which happened about two years afterward and he saw himself lord and master he openly declared his marriage and he went in great ceremony to conduct his queen to the palace. he had at the same time taken up little morning and carried her to his wife to conceal her in the lodging he had at the bottom of the courtyard. the king could not but be very sorry for she was his mother but he soon comforted himself with his beautiful wife and his pretty children. she had by a former husband two daughters of her own humor who were indeed exactly like her in all things. it happened that the kings son gave a ball and invited all persons of fashion to it. her godmother who saw her all in tears asked her what was the matter. this done she gave her a pair of glass slippers the prettiest in the whole world. the kings son who was told that a great princess whom nobody knew was come ran out to receive her he gave her his hand as she alighted out of the coach and led her into the ball among all the company. how handsome she is ha when she got home she ran to seek out her godmother and after having thanked her she said she could not but heartily wish she might go next day to the ball because the kings son had desired her. as she was eagerly telling her godmother whatever had passed at the ball her two sisters knocked at the door which cinderella ran and opened. could not i see her ah she left behind one of her glass slippers which the prince took up most carefully. the guards at the palace gate were asked
if they had not seen a princess go out. thereupon in came her godmother who having touched with her wand cinderellas clothes made them richer and more magnificent than any of those she had before. and now her two sisters found her to be that fine beautiful lady whom they had seen at the ball. she was conducted to the young prince dressed as she was he thought her more charming than ever and a few days after married her. aladdin and the wonderful lamp 
there once lived a poor tailor who had a son called aladdin a careless idle boy who would do nothing but play ball all day long in the streets with little idle boys like himself. this so grieved the father that he died yet in spite of his mothers tears and prayers aladdin did not mend his ways. he then turned to aladdin and asked him his trade at which the boy hung his head while his mother burst into tears. the next day the magician led aladdin into some beautiful gardens a long way outside the city gates. they then journeyed onward till they almost reached the mountains. at last they came to two mountains divided by a narrow valley. aladdin tried to run away but the magician caught him and gave him a blow that knocked him down. the stone came up quite easily and some steps appeared. aladdin found everything as the magician had said gathered some fruit off the trees and having got the lamp arrived at the mouth of the cave. the magician flew into a terrible passion and throwing some more powder on to the fire he said something and the stone rolled back into its place. though he alone knew where to find it he could only receive it from the hand of another. he had picked out the foolish aladdin for this purpose intending to get the lamp and kill him afterward. at last he clasped his hands in prayer and in so doing rubbed the ring which the magician had forgotten to take from him. when he came to himself he told his mother what had passed and showed her the lamp and the fruits he had gathered in the garden which were in reality precious stones. he then asked for some food. she begged him to sell it and have nothing to do with devils. the princess lifted her veil as she went in and looked so beautiful that aladdin fell in love with her at first sight. he went home so changed that his mother was frightened. he told her he loved the princess so deeply that he could not live without her and meant to ask her in marriage of her father. the grand vizier and the lords of council had just gone in as she entered the hall and placed herself in front of the sultan. he however took no notice of her. she went every day for a week and stood in the same place. she then told him of her sons violent love for the princess. the sultan granted this and told aladdins mother that though he consented to the marriage she must not appear before him again for three months. the unhappy viziers son jumped up and hid himself while the princess would not say a word and was very sorrowful. her mother did not believe her in the least but bade her rise and consider it an idle dream. she then confessed all bidding him to ask the viziers son if it were not so. the sultan told the vizier to ask his son who owned the truth adding that dearly as he loved the princess he had rather die than go through another such fearful night and wished to be separated from her. when the three months were over aladdin sent his mother to remind the sultan of his promise. she stood in the same place as before and the sultan who had forgotten aladdin at once remembered him and sent for her. aladdin made them set out to the palace two and two followed by his mother. those who had played with him in his childhood knew him not he had grown so handsome. when the sultan saw him he came down from his throne embraced him and led him into a hall where a feast was spread intending to marry him to the princess that very day. aladdins mother then dressed herself carefully and walked to the palace with her slaves while he followed her on horseback. at night the princess said goodby to her father and set out on the carpet for aladdins palace with his mother at her side and followed by the hundred slaves. she was charmed at the sight of aladdin who ran to receive her. next day aladdin invited the sultan to see the palace. the sultan was surprised to receive his jewels again and visited aladdin who showed him the window finished. aladdin had won the hearts of the people by his gentle bearing. he knew that the poor tailors son could only have accomplished this by means of the lamp and traveled night and day until he reached the capital of china bent on aladdins ruin. as he passed through the town he heard people talking everywhere about a marvellous palace. next morning the sultan looked out of the window toward aladdins palace and rubbed his eyes for it was gone. he sent for the vizier and asked what had become of the palace. the vizier looked out too and was lost in astonishment. he again put it down to enchantment and this time the sultan believed him and sent thirty men on horseback to fetch aladdin in chains. they met him riding home bound him and forced him to go with them on foot. the people however who loved him followed armed to see that he came to no harm. aladdin now begged to know what he had done. aladdin was so amazed that he could not say a word. his prayer was granted and he went forth sadly from the sultans presence. he came to the banks of a river and knelt down to say his prayers before throwing himself in. in so doing he rubbed the magic ring he still wore. as she was dressing one of her women looked out and saw aladdin. the princess ran and opened the window and at the noise she made aladdin looked up. she called to him to come to her and great was the joy of these lovers at seeing each other again. he is for ever speaking ill of you but i only reply by my tears. he changed clothes with the first person he met in the town and having bought a certain powder returned to the princess who let him in by a little side door. the princess then opened the door to aladdin and flung her arms round his neck but aladdin put her away bidding her leave him as he had more to do. the sultan who was sitting in his closet mourning for his lost daughter happened to look up and rubbed his eyes for there stood the palace as before aladdin told him what had happened and showed him the dead body of the magician that he might believe. he changed clothes with her colored his face like hers put on her veil and murdered her that she might tell no tales. when he got to the palace there was such a noise going on round him that the princess bade her slave look out of the window and ask what was the matter. when he had done the princess made him sit by her and begged him to stay with her always. the princess showed him the hall and asked him what he thought of it. he it was who put that wish into your wifes head. after this aladdin and his wife lived in peace. he succeeded the sultan when he died and reigned for many years leaving behind him a long line of kings. the tale of a youth who set out to learn what fear was 
a father had two sons of whom the eldest was clever and bright and always knew what he was about but the youngest was stupid and couldnt learn or understand anything. it makes one shudder nothing makes me shudder. he stood there in the night like one who meant harm. but at midnight it got so chill that in spite of the fire he couldnt keep warm. then he stirred the fire blew it up and placed them all round in a circle that they might warm themselves. but they sat there and did not move and the fire caught their clothes. then he sat down at his fire and fell asleep. if i could only shudder if i could only shudder the king had promised the man who dared to do this thing his daughter as wife and she was the most beautiful maiden under the sun. there was also much treasure hid in the castle guarded by evil spirits which would then be free and was sufficient to make a poor man more than rich. many had already gone in but so far none had ever come out again. some of them fled away and the others he struck dead and threw them out into the pond below. and as he sat thus his eyes refused to keep open any longer and a desire to sleep stole over him. then he looked around him and beheld in the corner a large bed. but when he wished to close his eyes the bed began to move by itself and ran all round the castle. all of a sudden crash crash in the morning the king came and when he beheld him lying on the ground he imagined the ghosts had been too much for him and that he was dead. the next morning the king came anxious for news. oh ha in it lay a dead man. he felt his face and it was cold as ice. when that too had no effect it occurred to him that if two people lay together in bed they warmed each other so he put him into the bed covered him up and lay down beside him after a time the corpse became warm and began to move. then the six men came and carried him out again. the old man drew near him in order to watch closely and his white beard hung right down. the youth drew out the axe and let him go. how i shudder how i shudder dear wife now it happened one day that he had an audience with the king and in order to appear a person of some importance he told him that he had a daughter who could spin straw into gold. so the poor millers daughter sat down and didnt know what in the world she was to do. she hadnt the least idea of how to spin straw into gold and became at last so miserable that she began to cry. as he had however six sons and six daughters he found that his money was not too much to let them all have everything they fancied as they were accustomed to do. their house caught fire and was speedily burnt to the ground with all the splendid furniture the books pictures gold silver and precious goods it contained and this was only the beginning of their troubles. indeed the daughters at first hoped that their friends who had been so numerous while they were rich would insist on their staying in their houses now they no longer possessed one. so nothing was left for them but to take their departure to the cottage which stood in the midst of a dark forest and seemed to be the most dismal place upon the face of the earth. only the youngest daughter had any doubt but that they would soon again be as rich as they were before or at least rich enough to live comfortably in some town where they would find amusement and gay companions once more. her father however was pleased but as he thought that at her age she certainly ought to like pretty presents he told her to choose something. thinking that this must be prepared for someone who was expected he sat down to wait till he should come and very soon fell into a sweet sleep. not even a servant was to be seen there was no sign of life in the palace this path had a hedge of roses on each side of it and the merchant thought he had never seen or smelt such exquisite flowers. they reminded him of his promise to beauty and he stopped and had just gathered one to take to her when he was startled by a strange noise behind him. was it not enough that i allowed you to be in my palace and was kind to you this is the way you show your gratitude by stealing my flowers on no other condition will i have her. you seem to be an honest man so i will trust you to go home. i give you a month to see if either of your daughters will come back with you and stay here to let you go free. if neither of them is willing you must come alone after bidding them goodby for ever for then you will belong to me. the merchant accepted this proposal though he did not really think any of his daughters could be persuaded to come. he promised to return at the time appointed and then anxious to escape from the presence of the beast he asked permission to set off at once. but the beast answered that he could not go until next day. but he was too terrified to eat and only tasted a few of the dishes for fear the beast should be angry if he did not obey his orders. when he had finished he heard a great noise in the next room which he knew meant that the beast was coming. then you will find your breakfast waiting for you here and the horse you are to ride will be ready in the courtyard. he will also bring you back again when you come with your daughter a month hence. farewell. then after a hasty breakfast he went to gather beautys rose and mounted his horse which carried him off so swiftly that in an instant he had lost sight of the palace and he was still wrapped in gloomy thoughts when it stopped before the door of the cottage. but he reminded them that he had promised to go back. then the girls were very angry with beauty and said it was all her fault and that if she had asked for something sensible this would never have happened and complained bitterly that they should have to suffer for her folly. who could have guessed that to ask for a rose in the middle of summer would cause so much misery but as i did the mischief it is only just that i should suffer for it. her father still tried to persuade her to go back but in vain. the merchant knew that this was meant for them and beauty who was rather less frightened now that she had passed through so many rooms and seen nothing of the beast was quite willing to begin for her long ride had made her very hungry. but they had hardly finished their meal when the noise of the beasts footsteps was heard approaching and beauty clung to her father in terror which became all the greater when she saw how frightened he was. this evidently pleased the beast. they were greatly surprised at the riches it contained. but she felt sure that her father was leaving her for ever so she was very sad when the bell rang sharply for the second time and warned them that the time had come for them to part. then beauty began to cry and wandered sadly back to her own room. but she soon found that she was very sleepy and as she had nothing better to do she lay down and instantly fell asleep. you are not so unfortunate as you suppose. here you will be rewarded for all you have suffered elsewhere. how can i set him free i dont understand it. but after all it was only a dream so why should i trouble myself about it tearing herself away from the portrait at last she passed through into a room which contained every musical instrument under the sun and here she amused herself for a long while in trying some of them and singing until she was tired. beauty found her supper served just at the time she preferred to have it but she did not see anyone or hear a sound and though her father had warned her that she would be alone she began to find it rather dull. then the beast asked her how she had been amusing herself and she told him all the rooms she had seen. then he asked if she thought she could be happy in his palace and beauty answered that everything was so beautiful that she would be very hard to please if she could not be happy. and after about an hours talk beauty began to think that the beast was not nearly so terrible as she had supposed at first. and after he was gone she was very soon in bed and asleep and dreaming of her unknown prince. why are you so unkind to me there was one room which she had not noticed particularly it was empty except that under each of the windows stood a very comfortable chair and the first time she had looked out of the window it had seemed to her that a black curtain prevented her from seeing anything outside. so everything went on for a long time until at last happy as she was beauty began to long for the sight of her father and her brothers and sisters and one night seeing her look very sad the beast asked her what was the matter. beauty had quite ceased to be afraid of him. so she answered that she was longing to see her home once more. beauty have you the heart to desert an unhappy beast like this what more do you want to make you happy take the four boxes you will find in the room next to your own and fill them with everything you wish to take with you. you will not need any chariot to bring you back. then she went to bed but could hardly sleep for joy. where could she be she got up and dressed hastily and then saw that the boxes she had packed the night before were all in the room. her brothers and sisters were all astonished at her appearance as they had never expected to see her again and there was no end to the questions they asked her. she had also much to hear about what had happened to them while she was away and of her fathers journey home. at any rate for two months she need not decide but could enjoy herself with her sisters. then her sisters seemed to have got quite used to being without her and even found her rather in the way so she would not have been sorry when the two months were over but for her father and brothers who begged her to stay and seemed so grieved at the thought of her departure that she had not the courage to say goodby to them. every day when she got up she meant to say it at night and when night came she put it off again until at last she had a dismal dream which helped her to make up her mind. beauty you are only just in time to save his life. see what happens when people do not keep their promises everything was just as before and her birds were so glad to see her but when it did come and no beast appeared she was really frightened so after listening and waiting for a long time she ran down into the garden to search for him. she rushed down it and sure enough there was the cave and in it lay the beast asleep as beauty thought. beauty you only came just in time. i was dying because i thought you had forgotten your promise. beauty answered politely and quite enjoyed telling him all that had happened to her. at the same moment the wheels of a chariot were heard upon the terrace and two ladies entered the room. the mastermaid 
once upon a time there was a king who had many sons. i do not exactly know how many there were but the youngest of them could not stay quietly at home and was determined to go out into the world and try his luck and after a long time the king was forced to give him leave to go. when he had traveled about for several days he came to a giants house and hired himself to the giant as a servant. in the morning the giant had to go out to pasture his goats and as he was leaving the house he told the kings son that he must clean out the stable. but what i set you to do must be done both well and thoroughly and you must on no account go into any of the rooms which lead out of the room in which you slept last night. but when evening was drawing near she said that it would now be better for him to clean out the stable before the giant came home. when he had done that he went back again into the room in which the giant had given him leave to stay and there he walked backward and forward on the floor and began to hum and sing. then came the giant home with the goats. then she asked him what he had to do that day. but the youth carefully watched his opportunity and just as it was rushing at him with open jaws he threw the bit straight into its mouth and the horse stood as quiet as a young lamb and there was no difficulty at all in getting it home to the stable. then the prince went back into his room again and began to hum and to sing. toward evening the giant came home. on the morning of the third day the giant again had to go into the wood with the goats. so he set out on his way and did exactly what the mastermaid had told him. he went to the rocky wall and took the club and knocked on it. it was lying inside the mountain like heaps of stones in a waste place and he got a load that was as large as he was able to carry and with that he went his way. next day the giant took him to the mastermaid. now when the giant had slept a good long time he began to stretch himself on the bench on which he was lying. so the giant lay down to sleep again and slept for a long long time. then he began to move about a little again. when he had slept again for many hours he began to move and stretch himself. but there was no one to give him an answer. when he saw this he understood what had happened and fell into such a rage that he hardly knew what he was doing. away he went after the prince and the mastermaid so fast that the wind whistled behind him and it was not long before he came to the water but he could not get over it. so at last the mastermaid had to yield for he was so absolutely determined to do it. but no sooner had he got the piece of apple in his mouth than he forgot the mastermaid and that he was to go back in the coach to fetch her. so she went away and when she had walked a short distance she came to a little hut which stood all alone in a small wood hard by the kings palace. she entered it and asked if she might be allowed to stay there. she took out her chest of gold and flung a handful of it or so into the fire and the gold boiled up and poured out over the whole of the hut until every part of it both inside and out was gilded. well as he had such a fine lot of money the mastermaid said she would have him so they sat down to talk. but scarcely had they sat down together before the mastermaid wanted to jump up again. so she promised to have him and he sat down on the bench by her to arrange about it but suddenly she said that she had forgotten to lock the door of the porch that night and must do it. the mastermaid answered him as she had answered the other two that if he had a great deal of money she would have him. so it was settled that he was to have the mastermaid. on the following day the wedding was to take place in the kings palace and the elder brother was to drive to church with his bride and the brother who had been with the giant with her sister. this went on for a long time and they could not get away from the palace so they were all in great trouble. but all at once just as they were starting the bottom of the coach fell in pieces. they were just setting out again but now the horses were not able to draw the coach. they had six horses already and now they put in eight and then ten and then twelve but the more they put in and the more the coachman whipped them the less good it did and the coach never stirred from the spot. it was already beginning to be late in the day and to church they must and would go so everyone who was in the palace was in a state of distress. so the king had to go himself and the mastermaid went with him immediately and as the king believed that she was more than she appeared to be he seated her in the place of honor by the youngest bridegroom. when they had sat at the table for a short time the mastermaid took out the cock and the hen and the golden apple which she had brought away with her from the giants house and set them on the table in front of her and instantly the cock and the hen began to fight with each other for the golden apple. so the prince knew her again and you may imagine how delighted he was. 1

why the sea is salt 
once upon a time long long ago there were two brothers the one rich and the other poor. when christmas eve came the poor one had not a bite in the house either of meat or bread so he went to his brother and begged him in gods name to give him something for christmas day. it was by no means the first time that the brother had been forced to give something to him and he was not better pleased at being asked now than he generally was. the poor one immediately thanked him and promised this. now the poor brother had both the money and the mill again. he asked if it could make salt. when he had gone a little way out to sea he took the mill on deck. the master cat or puss in boots 
there was a miller who left no more estate to the three sons he had than his mill his ass and his cat. the eldest had the mill the second the ass and the youngest nothing but the cat. scarce was he lain down but he had what he wanted. proud of his prey he went with it to the palace and asked to speak with his majesty. the cat continued for two or three months thus to carry his majesty from time to time game of his masters taking. help this cunning cat had hidden them under a great stone. the cat who had taken care to inform himself who this ogre was and what he could do asked to speak with him saying he could not pass so near his castle without having the honor of paying his respects to him. a little while after when puss saw that the ogre had resumed his natural form he came down and owned he had been very much frightened. puss no sooner perceived this but he fell upon him and ate him up. meanwhile the king who saw as he passed this fine castle of the ogres had a mind to go into it. so taking her pitcher she ran off in the clear moonlight to the fountain which was at some distance. six maids of honor carried her train and she leaned upon the arm of another. now the queen had been shut up in a great tower by the kings orders and when a great many days went by and still she heard nothing from the fairy she made her escape from the window by means of a rope ladder taking her little baby with her. when i had finished she touched me with a wand she held in her hand and instantly i became a hen and there was an end of my talking i was very sad and my husband who was out when it happened never knew what had become of me. after seeking me everywhere he believed that i must have been drowned or eaten up by wild beasts in the forest. it was one of them whom you threw out of your window yesterday. but we must not despair it seems to me after what you have told me that something must be going to happen soon. she found them nearly dying for want of water and hastily poured all that was left in the pitcher upon them. the fresh air soon made her open her pretty eyes and there before her stood the queen of the woods looking as charming as ever. he knelt upon one knee and kissed the queens hand. i could only bring prince pink to the place where you were being brought up hoping that when you grew up he might love you and by your care be restored to his natural form. and you see everything has come right as i hoped it would. your giving me the silver ring was the sign that the power of the charm was nearly over and my enemys last chance was to frighten you with her army of rats. how can i explain to you the cause of my hesitation i feel for the first time in my life how happy it would make me to be beloved. the prince and princess were married as soon as possible with great splendor and lived happily ever after. the white cat 
once upon a time there was a king who had three sons who were all so clever and brave that he began to be afraid that they would want to reign over the kingdom before he was dead. they bade farewell to the king who gave them presents of silver and precious stones and appointed to meet them at the same hour in the same place after a year had passed to see the little dogs they had brought for him. each one took a different road and the two eldest met with many adventures but it is about the youngest that you are going to hear. he was young and gay and handsome and knew everything that a prince ought to know and as for his courage there was simply no end to it. as soon as he had bought a pretty one he was sure to see a still prettier and then he had to get rid of all the others and buy that one as being alone he found it impossible to take thirty or forty thousand dogs about with him. he did not know his way and to make matters worse it began to thunder and the rain poured down. he took the first path he could find and after walking for a long time he fancied he saw a faint light and began to hope that he was coming to some cottage where he might find shelter for the night. there he saw a deers foot hanging by a chain of diamonds and he began to wonder who could live in this magnificent castle. he was so much surprised that he stood quite still until he felt himself pushed forward by other hands so that though he was somewhat uneasy he could not help going on. the sight of the latter made the prince feel as if he could not enjoy his supper at all but the white cat seeing this assured him that the dishes intended for him were prepared in a separate kitchen and he might be quite certain that they contained neither rats nor mice and the prince felt so sure that she would not deceive him that he had no more hesitation in beginning. to his great surprise he found it represented an extremely handsome young man who was so like himself that it might have been his own portrait and so the days passed in every kind of amusement until the year was nearly gone. he thanked her a thousand times and said goodby quite sadly when the time came for him to set out. after all the prince was the first to arrive at the castle where he had agreed to meet his brothers but they came soon after and stared in amazement when they saw the wooden horse in the courtyard jumping like a hunter. fond as they all were of one another the two eldest could not help being glad to think that their dogs certainly had a better chance. the next morning they started in the same chariot. when they reached the palace everyone crowded round to welcome them as they went into the kings great hall and when the two brothers presented their little dogs nobody could decide which was the prettier. he opened it quickly and there upon a white cushion they saw a dog so small that it could easily have been put through a ring. the prince laid it upon the ground and it got up at once and began to dance. the king did not know what to say for it was impossible that anything could be prettier than this little creature. the brothers were not very willing to set out again but the two eldest consented because it gave them another chance and they started as before. the youngest again mounted the wooden horse and rode back at full speed to his beloved white cat. the hands hastened to meet him and led the wooden horse off to the stable while he hurried in to find the white cat. you can imagine how fast he traveled when i tell you that they reached the kings palace in just half the time it had taken the wooden horse to get there. seated in a gallery from which she could see his arrival the white cat waited for him. sometimes the prince could not help asking the white cat how it was she could talk. days go by so quickly when one is very happy that it is certain the prince would never have thought of its being time to go back when one evening as they sat together the white cat said to him that if he wanted to take a lovely princess home with him the next day he must be prepared to do what she told him. on the way they had to pass near an old castle belonging to the fairies. nobody had ever been into it but it was reported to be full of the most wonderful things and my mother remembered to have heard that the fairies had in their garden such fruits as were to be seen and tasted nowhere else. she began to wish to try them for herself and turned her steps in the direction of the garden. now the more difficult it became to obtain the fruit the more the queen was determined that have it she would. my dear madam cried the queen is there nothing else that you will take for the fruit you see they grew upon fairy trees. at first the queen was afraid to tell him but when as soon as they reached the palace five frightful little dwarfs were sent by the fairies to fetch me she was obliged to confess what she had promised. the king was very angry and had the queen and myself shut up in a great tower and safely guarded and drove the little dwarfs out of his kingdom but the fairies sent a great dragon who ate up all the people he met and whose breath burnt up everything as he passed through the country and at last after trying in vain to rid himself of this monster the king to save his subjects was obliged to consent that i should be given up to the fairies. there i grew up surrounded with everything that was beautiful and rare and learning everything that is ever taught to a princess but without any companions but a parrot and a little dog who could both talk and receiving every day a visit from one of the old fairies who came mounted upon the dragon. one day however as i sat at my window i saw a handsome young prince who seemed to have been hunting in the forest which surrounded my prison and who was standing and looking up at me. but after that he came again many times and at last i consented to marry him but the question was how was i to escape from my tower. before he had time to defend himself my unhappy lover was swallowed up by the dragon. as the princess was as kind and clever as she was beautiful you may imagine what a delightful journey the prince found it for everything the princess said seemed to him quite charming. the prince saw his brothers walking upon the terrace each with a lovely princess and they came to meet him asking if he had also found a wife. at which they laughed very much and asked him if he was afraid of being eaten up by mice in the palace. and then they set out together for the town. after them came the youngest prince and last of all the crystal chair at which everybody looked with admiration and curiosity. when the courtiers saw them coming they hastened to tell the king. and when they answered that nobody had ever before seen such lovely princesses he seemed quite annoyed. their hut was quite hidden by trees and none saw their beauty but the sun by day and the moon by night and the eyes of the stars. the thread had to be fine and even and when done was locked up in a secret chamber by the old woman who twice or thrice every summer went a journey. before she went she gave out work for each day of her absence and always returned in the night so that the girls never saw what she brought back with her neither would she tell them whence the gold flax came nor what it was to be used for. the sun had set when he awoke and began once more to try and find his way out of the forest. after three days search they found the hut. the prince was still sitting by the door and had been so happy in the maidens company that the time had seemed like a single hour. before leaving he promised to return and fetch her to his fathers court where he would make her his bride. she was furiously angry and told the maiden that she had brought down misery both on herself and on the prince. the maiden could not rest for thinking of this. at last she could bear it no longer and resolved to seek help from the prince. the raven promised faithfully to do her bidding and spreading its wings flew away. when the prince heard it he was very sorrowful and took counsel with his friends how to free the maiden. the maiden thanked the bird heartily and went home telling no one what she had heard. on this night she crept quietly out of the house and waited trembling at some little distance from the hut. the moon shone so brightly that they had no difficulty in seeing the marked trees. next morning when the youngest girl did not come to her work the old woman asked where she was. mother of the wind carry with thee this magic ball. the horse on which the prince and the maiden were riding had just reached the middle when the magic ball flew by. but none could cure him. a year afterward he came suddenly upon the bridge where his beloved met her death. as he recalled the misfortune he wept bitterly and would have given all he possessed to have her once more alive. in the midst of his grief he thought he heard a voice singing and looked round but could see no one. before he went to bed the eldest made a cake of magic herbs which she gave him to eat. in the night he dreamed that he was living in the forest and could understand all that the birds said to each other. having promised this he joyfully returned home and as he was riding through the forest he could perfectly understand all that the birds said. there he waited hoping to hear the song. there is near it a large stone. he then grasped them and rose to the surface letting the water flow over the flower. at last he saw it and close by the large stone. she was ten times more beautiful than before and wore a magnificent pale yellow robe sparkling with jewels. she thanked him for having freed her from the cruel witchs power and willingly consented to marry him. but when they came to the bridge where he had left his horse it was nowhere to be seen for though the prince thought he had been a crab only a few hours he had in reality been under the water for more than ten days. in this they drove to the palace. great was their delight and astonishment when the prince entered leading the beautiful maiden by the hand. have you forgotten the two poor maidens who helped you in your distress must they spin gold flax for ever have no pity on the old witch. the maidens had dreamed that he was coming and were ready to go with him but first they made a cake in which they put poison and left it on a table where the old woman was likely to see it when she returned. the terrible head 
once upon a time there was a king whose only child was a girl. no man ever saw her and she never saw even the fields and the sea but only the sky and the sun for there was a wide open window in the roof of the house of brass. now one day it seemed to her that the sky opened above her and a great shower of shining gold fell through the window in the roof and lay glittering in her room. not very long after the princess had a baby a little boy but when the king her father heard of it he was very angry and afraid for now the child was born that should be his death. there was a beautiful lady and a little boy. so he took them home and was very kind to them and brought up the boy till he was a young man. now when the boy had come to his full strength the king of that country fell in love with his mother and wanted to marry her but he knew that she would never part from her boy. so he thought of a plan to get rid of the boy and this was his plan a great queen of a country not far off was going to be married and this king said that all his subjects must bring him wedding presents to give her. now these women were so awful to look on that whoever saw them was turned at once into stone. and two of them could not be put to death but the youngest whose face was very beautiful could be killed and it was her head that the boy had promised to bring. you may imagine it was no easy adventure. so he went out from the feast where they all sat drinking and making merry and he walked alone beside the sea in the dusk of the evening at the place where the great chest with himself and his mother in it had been cast ashore. then he felt some one touch him on the shoulder and he turned and saw a young man like a kings son having with him a tall and beautiful lady whose blue eyes shone like stars. and with these shoes you will fly as fleet as a bird or a thought over the land or over the waves of the sea wherever the shoes know the way. and these roads have you to travel. now first you must go to the three gray sisters who live far off in the north and are so very cold that they have only one eye and one tooth among the three. but behold they had vanished he knew not how or where there in a blue cave of the ice he found the three gray sisters the oldest of living things. now the opening of the cave in the ice was narrow and it was not easy to pass in without touching one of the gray sisters. but he said he would never give them the eye till they told him the way to the fairies of the garden. but at last they told him to keep always south and with the land on his left and the sea on his right till he reached the island of the fairies of the garden. then he gave them back the eye and they began to look out once more for the old times coming back again. there he alighted and there he found the three fairies of the garden. they were like three very beautiful young women dressed one in green one in white and one in red and they were dancing and singing round an apple tree with apples of gold and this was their song
       the song of the western fairies 
     round and round the apples of gold        round and round dance we      thus do we dance from the days of old        about the enchanted tree      round and round and round we go      while the spring is green or the stream shall flow        or the wind shall stir the sea these grave dancing fairies were very unlike the grey women and they were glad to see the boy and treated him kindly. but the youngest slept between her two sisters and she lay on her back with her beautiful sad face turned to the sky and though she slept her eyes were wide open. if the boy had seen her he would have been changed into stone by the terror and the pity of it she was so awful but he had thought of a plan for killing her without looking on her face. as soon as he caught sight of the three from far off he took his shining shield from his shoulders and held it up like a mirror so that he saw the dreadful women reflected in it and did not see the terrible head itself. the girl was so frightened or so tired that she was only prevented from falling by the iron chain about her waist and there she hung as if she were dead. the boy was very sorry for her and flew down and stood beside her. when he spoke she raised her head and looked round but his voice only seemed to frighten her. then he remembered that he was wearing the cap of darkness and that she could only hear him not see him. and he thought her the most beautiful girl in the world. and she told him that she was the daughter of the king of that country and that she was tied there to be eaten by a monstrous beast out of the sea for the beast came and devoured a girl every day. now the lot had fallen on her and as she was just saying this a long fierce head of a cruel sea creature rose out of the waves and snapped at the girl. but the beast had been too greedy and too hurried so he missed his aim the first time. and when the sea beast leaped out once more its eyes fell on the head and instantly it was turned into a stone. then the boy and the girl went to the palace of the king her father where everyone was weeping for her death and they could hardly believe their eyes when they saw her come back well. there he left them and there they were found by the man and woman who had met him at home beside the sea and had helped him to start on his journey. but whom should he meet in the very street of the town but his own mother flying for her life from the wicked king who now wished to kill her because he found that she would never marry him she did not know of course where the boy had gone but thought the king had slain him secretly. so now she was running for her very life and the wicked king was following her with a sword in his hand. then behold she ran into her sons very arms but he had only time to kiss her and step in front of her when the king struck at him with his sword. now all the people rejoiced because the wicked king should rule them no longer. and they asked the boy to be their king but he said no he must take his mother home to her fathers house. so the people chose for king the man who had been kind to his mother when first she was cast on the island in the great chest. but the boy and his wife and his mother went back to the kingdom that was theirs and lived long and happily after all their troubles. the story of pretty goldilocks 
once upon a time there was a princess who was the prettiest creature in the world. she always wore a crown of flowers and her dresses were embroidered with diamonds and pearls and everybody who saw her fell in love with her. now one of her neighbors was a young king who was not married. he was very rich and handsome and when he heard all that was said about pretty goldilocks though he had never seen her he fell so deeply in love with her that he could neither eat nor drink. after he had started nothing else was talked of at court and the king felt so sure that the princess would consent that he set his people to work at pretty dresses and splendid furniture that they might be ready by the time she came. she only answered that she was very much obliged to the king but she had no wish to be married. now there was at the court a young man who was more clever and handsome than anyone else. the poor prisoner had only a little straw for his bed and but for a little stream of water which flowed through the tower he would have died of thirst. but charming said that he only wanted a good horse to ride and the king who was delighted at his being ready to start so promptly gave him letters to the princess and bade him good speed. it was on a monday morning that he set out all alone upon his errand thinking of nothing but how he could persuade the princess goldilocks to marry the king. in leaping after little flies she had thrown herself high upon the bank where she had lain till she was nearly dead. charming had pity upon her and though he couldnt help thinking that she would have been very nice for dinner he picked her up gently and put her back into the water. another day as he journeyed on he saw a raven in great distress. the poor bird was closely pursued by an eagle which would soon have eaten it up had not charming quickly fitted an arrow to his bow and shot the eagle dead. the raven perched upon a tree very joyfully. before the sun rose he found himself in a thick wood where it was too dark for him to see his path and here he heard an owl crying as if it were in despair. when he arrived he thought everything he saw delightful and magnificent. looking at strangers out of the window then charming was led in and was so struck with astonishment and admiration that at first not a word could he say. but she answered that she did not want any presents and that he was to remember what she had just told him. but what could i do but very soon he arrived at the palace with the giants head of which she was still terrified though it could no longer do her any harm. the beautiful things will always remain beautiful and the ugly things become lovely. if one is young one never grows old and if one is old one becomes young. he is going to the cavern alone though if he had a hundred men with him he could not succeed. charming knew he could not be far from the gloomy cavern and on looking about him he saw a black hideous rock from which came a thick smoke followed in a moment by one of the dragons with fire blazing from his mouth and eyes. charming thanked her with all his heart and joyfully hastened back to the town. he went straight to the palace and gave the flask to the princess who had no further objection to make. so she thanked charming and ordered that preparations should be made for her departure and they soon set out together. when pretty goldilocks heard what had happened she threw herself at the kings feet and begged him to set charming free but the more she cried the more angry he was and at last she saw that it was useless to say any more but it made her very sad. not knowing what to do she had hastily swept away the pieces of crystal and then remembered that in the kings room she had seen a flask of exactly the same shape also filled with sparkling water. so without saying a word she fetched it and stood it upon the queens shelf. everybody was delighted that he should be king and the wedding which took place at once was the prettiest that can be imagined and prince charming and princess goldilocks lived happily ever after. when he saw the streets covered with dirt instead of gold and found himself in a strange place without a friend without food and without money. people are too apt to reproach those who beg with being idle but give themselves no concern to put them in the way of getting business to do or considering whether they are able to do it which is not charity. at last miss alice his masters daughter was informed of it and then she took compassion on the poor boy and made the servants treat him kindly. this he put into his pocket being determined to lay it out to the best advantage and the next day seeing a woman in the street with a cat under her arm he ran up to know the price of it. she then offered to lay down something for him but the merchant told his daughter that would not do it must be something of his own. he immediately put down miss puss who killed a great number of them. the king rejoiced greatly to see his old enemies destroyed by so small a creature and the queen was highly pleased and desired the cat might be brought near that she might look at her. the merchant however made him come in and ordered a chair to be set for him. the king her father gave her more dresses and jewels in a month than he gave the others in a year but she was so generous that she shared everything with her sisters and they were all as happy and as fond of one another as they could be. what made you dress yourself all in white she does not think me worthy of her consideration i consider that it means strange things against me therefore i order you to take her away into the forest and kill her and that i may be sure it is done you must bring me her heart and her tongue. i have never done you any harm and have always spoken well of you to the king. if i had deserved my fathers anger i would suffer without a murmur but alas it was such a little one not bigger than the princesss thumb that they decided sorrowfully that it was of no use at all the king would not have been taken in by it for a moment but when the captain of the guard would have taken her tongue it turned out to be quite black so that would not have deceived the king either. alas it is not always kings and princes who are the happiest people in the world. this the king touched with his foot and immediately it fell down and he invited the princess to enter without fear. the wonderful sheep begged that the princess would consider herself queen over all that she saw and assured her that though for some years he had been very sad and in great trouble she had it in her power to make him forget all his grief. i was once a king and my kingdom was the most splendid in the world. do not think that you can deceive me you fancy you are going to escape but i assure you that you are going to stay here and the first thing i shall give you to do will be to keep my sheep they are very good company and speak quite as well as you do. i did not lose the power of speech or of feeling the misery of my present state. the young slave of whom i told you about is one of these i have seen her often and it has been a great pleasure to me. oh princess i have loved you so long and yet how dare i tell you of my love so the princesss days passed very gaily while she waited for the happy time to come. however the fear of not getting away made her leave before the marriage was over. the king who had hoped to join the unknown princess and find out who she was was dreadfully disappointed when she disappeared so suddenly and gave orders that if she ever came again the doors were to be shut that she might not get away so easily. after some time came the news that the kings second daughter was going to be married. this request made him feel very sad as if some misfortune must surely come of it but his love for the princess being stronger than anything else he did not like to refuse her. so with the same escort she set out and reached the palace as the marriage ceremony began. everybody was delighted to see her she was so pretty that they thought she must be some fairy princess and the princes who were there could not take their eyes off her. she felt more at ease when the king came up to her and with the greatest respect begged her not to run away so soon but at least to honor him by staying for the splendid feast which was prepared for the princes and princesses. but while she was thus enjoying herself with the king and her sisters the king of the sheep was waiting impatiently for the time of her return and when it came and went and no princess appeared his anxiety became so great that he could bear it no longer. oh but what a sight met her eyes at the very entrance of the palace there lay her dear kind sheep silent and motionless upon the pavement she threw herself out of the chariot and ran to him crying bitterly for she realized that her broken promise had cost him his life and for a long long time she was so unhappy that they thought she would have died too. the eldest was but ten years old and the youngest only seven. he was very little and when born no bigger than ones thumb which made him be called little thumb. however having considered what a grief it would be to her to see them perish with hunger she at last consented and went to bed all in tears. little thumb heard every word that had been spoken for observing as he lay in his bed that they were talking very busily he got up softly and hid himself under his fathers stool that he might hear what they said without being seen. they went into a very thick forest where they could not see one another at ten paces distance. when the children saw they were left alone they began to cry as loud as they could. they dared not go in but sat themselves down at the door listening to what their father and mother were saying. where are now our poor children what are they now doing in the forest alas he threatened to beat her if she did not hold her tongue. they sat down to supper and ate with such a good appetite as pleased both father and mother whom they acquainted how frightened they were in the forest speaking almost always all together. night now came on and there arose a terribly high wind which made them dreadfully afraid. they fancied they heard on every side of them the howling of wolves coming to eat them up. they scarce dared to speak or turn their heads. he came down and when upon the ground he could see it no more which grieved him sadly. however having walked for some time with his brothers toward that side on which he had seen the light he perceived it again as he came out of the wood. they knocked at the door and a good woman came and opened it she asked them what they would have. little thumb told her they were poor children who had been lost in the forest and desired to lodge there for gods sake. poor babies whither are ye come upon this she hid them under the bed and went to open the door. the ogre presently asked if supper was ready and the wine drawn and then sat himself down to table. he drank a dozen glasses more than ordinary which got up into his head and obliged him to go to bed. they had been put to bed early with every one a crown of gold upon her head. well pleased with what he had done he went to bed again to his wife. they stole down softly into the garden and got over the wall. they kept running about all night and trembled all the while without knowing which way they went. the ogre fearing his wife would be too long in doing what he had ordered went up himself to help her. he was no less amazed than his wife at this frightful spectacle. they took his advice and got home presently. little thumb came up to the ogre pulled off his boots gently and put them on his own legs. the boots were very long and large but as they were fairies they had the gift of becoming big and little according to the legs of those who wore them so that they fitted his feet and legs as well as if they had been made on purpose for him. he went immediately to the ogres house where he saw his wife crying bitterly for the loss of the ogres murdered daughters. he went say they to the king and told him that if he desired it he would bring him news from the army before night. the king promised him a great sum of money upon that condition. one day when ali baba was in the forest he saw a troop of men on horseback coming toward him in a cloud of dust. he was afraid they were robbers and climbed into a tree for safety. a door opened in the rocks and having made the troop go in he followed them and the door shut again of itself. they stayed some time inside and ali baba fearing they might come out and catch him was forced to sit patiently in the tree. at last the door opened again and the forty thieves came out. he went in and the door shut behind him. he bade her keep the secret and he would go and bury the gold. he soon found the place and the door in the rock. he named several different sorts of grain all but the right one and the door still stuck fast. he was so frightened at the danger he was in that he had as much forgotten the word as if he had never heard it. on entering the cave they saw all the bags laid ready and could not imagine how anyone had got in without knowing their secret. the first thing he saw on entering the cave was his dead brother. two men must have known it we have killed one we must now find the other. the thief meantime told his comrades of his discovery. the captain thanked him and bade him show him the house he had marked. the captain now resolved to go himself but wiser than the others he did not mark the house but looked at it so closely that he could not fail to remember it. meanwhile her lamp went out and she had no more oil in the house. she filled her oil pot went back to the kitchen and having lit her lamp went again to the oil jar and filled a large kettle full of oil. when this brave deed was done she went back to the kitchen put out the fire and the lamp and waited to see what would happen. in a quarter of an hour the captain of the robbers awoke got up and opened the window. he listened and as none of his men seemed to stir he grew uneasy and went down into the yard. he found all the gang was dead and missing the oil out of the last jar became aware of the manner of their death. he then forced the lock of a door leading into a garden and climbing over several walls made his escape. seeing a man he started back in terror. remember he would eat no salt with you and what more would you have look at him at the end of a year ali baba hearing nothing of the two remaining robbers judged they were dead and set out to the cave. he brought away as much gold as he could carry and returned to town. the children too had not been able to sleep for hunger and had heard what their stepmother had said to their father. then they all set out together on the way to the forest. when they awoke at last it was pitch dark. the children must be got rid of well lead them deeper into the wood this time so that they wont be able to find their way out again. but the children were awake and had heard the conversation. they received their bit of bread but it was even smaller than the time before. the woman led the children still deeper into the forest farther than they had ever been in their lives before. then they fell asleep and evening passed away but nobody came to the poor children. they wandered about the whole night and the next day from morning till evening but they could not find a path out of the wood. they were very hungry too for they had nothing to eat but a few berries they found growing on the ground. and at last they were so tired that their legs refused to carry them any longer so they lay down under a tree and fell fast asleep. on the third morning after they had left their fathers house they set about their wandering again but only got deeper and deeper into the wood and now they felt that if help did not come to them soon they must perish. you dear children who led you here when four weeks had passed and hansel still remained thin she lost patience and determined to wait no longer. how the poor little sister sobbed as she carried the water and how the tears rolled down her cheeks gracious how they rejoiced and fell on each others necks and jumped for joy and kissed one another and as they had no longer any cause for fear they went in the old hags house and here they found in every corner of the room boxes with pearls and precious stones. the man had not passed a happy hour since he left them in the wood but the woman had died. thus all their troubles were ended and they lived happily ever afterward. my story is done. see the figure got up looked at them kindly but said nothing and vanished into the wood. and when they told their mother of their adventure she said what they had seen must have been the angel that guards good children. in winter snowwhite lit the fire and put on the kettle which was made of brass but so beautifully polished that it shone like gold. beside them on the ground lay a little lamb and behind them perched a little white dove with its head tucked under its wings. then the beast stretched himself in front of the fire and growled quite happily and comfortably. the children soon grew quite at their ease with him and led their helpless guest a fearful life. children spare my life youre already two too many for me. they ran forward and recognized their old friend the dwarf. he clung on with all his might to every rush and blade of grass but it didnt help him much he had to follow every movement of the fish and was in great danger of being drawn into the water. i cant appear like this before my own people. the evening sun shone on the glittering stones and they glanced and gleamed so beautifully that the children stood still and gazed on them. the dwarf jumped up in great fright but he hadnt time to reach his place of retreat for the bear was already close to him. ill give you all my treasure. look at those beautiful precious stones lying there. spare my life what pleasure would you get from a poor feeble little fellow like me you wont feel me between your teeth. in the meantime the real princess was left standing below in the courtyard. he went at once to the royal chamber and asked the bride who it was she had brought with her and had left thus standing in the court below. then he followed her through the field and hid himself behind a bush on the common. the eldest was so much like her in the face and humor that whoever looked upon the daughter saw the mother. they were both so disagreeable and so proud that there was no living with them. one day as she was at this fountain there came to her a poor woman who begged of her to let her drink. come hither fanny look what comes out of thy sisters mouth when she speaks. wouldst not thou be glad my dear to have the same gift given thee oh the kings son then on his return from hunting met her and seeing her so very pretty asked her what she did there alone and why she cried. she thereupon told him the whole story and so the kings son fell in love with her and considering himself that such a gift was worth more than any marriage portion conducted her to the palace of the king his father and there married her. as for the sister she made herself so much hated that her own mother turned her off and the miserable wretch having wandered about a good while without finding anybody to take her in went to a corner of the wood and there died. that night when he was alone in his room a beautiful lady suddenly appeared before him her long dress was as white as snow and she had a crown of white roses upon her head. the good king was very much surprised to see her for he knew his door had been tightly shut and he could not think how she had got in. if you had refused to help me i should have been certain that you were wicked. i thank you for the kindness you have shown me which has made me your friend for ever. i have but one son whom i love very dearly that is why he is called prince darling. you know well he would still be unhappy. for some time he behaved so well that the ring never pricked him and that made him so contented that his subjects called him prince darling the happy. instantly his ring pricked him sharply as if it had been a pin. he was very much surprised and sat down in a corner of his room feeling quite ashamed of himself. the fact was he had been brought up by a foolish nurse who had spoiled him when he was little. he gave himself up to doing every foolish thing that occurred to him until he became quite wicked and nobody could like him any longer. one day when the prince was walking about he saw a young girl who was so very pretty that he made up his mind at once that he would marry her. all day long the remembrance of what she had said annoyed him but as he loved her he could not make up his mind to have her punished. keep her in prison and feed her on bread and water for a little while and then if she still says she will not marry you have her head cut off to teach other people that you mean to be obeyed. he had a lions head a bulls horns a wolfs feet and a snakes body. so he ran toward the wood but before he had gone many yards he fell into a deep pit which had been made to trap bears and the hunters who were hiding in a tree leaped down and secured him with several chains and led him into the chief city of his own kingdom. i knew his heart and am certain that if it had not been for the bad influence of those who surrounded him he would have been a good king and a father to his people. he left off tearing at the iron bars of the cage in which he was shut up and became as gentle as a lamb. the queen said she would like to have this wonderful little dog and the prince would have been very happy in his new home if he could have forgotten that he was a man and a king. so poor prince darling was terribly hungry all day long but he was very patient about it. one day when they gave him his little loaf for breakfast he thought he would like to eat it out in the garden so he took it up in his mouth and trotted away toward a brook that he knew of a long way from the palace. but he was surprised to find that the brook was gone and where it had been stood a great house that seemed to be built of gold and precious stones. but what seemed very strange was that those people who came out of the house were pale and thin and their clothes were torn and hanging in rags about them. he remembered that white was the favorite color of the fairy truth and began to hope that he might at last win back her favor. he gave up the throne joyfully to the prince and remained always the most faithful of his subjects. in short everything succeeded so well that the youngest daughter began to think the master of the house not to have a beard so very blue and that he was a mighty civil gentleman. as soon as they returned home the marriage was concluded. but for this little one here it is the key of the closet at the end of the great gallery on the ground floor. her neighbors and good friends did not stay to be sent for by the new married lady so great was their impatience to see all the rich furniture of her house not daring to come while her husband was there because of his blue beard which frightened them. she then took the little key and opened it trembling but could not at first see anything plainly because the windows were shut. these were all the wives whom blue beard had married and murdered one after another. she thought she should have died for fear and the key which she pulled out of the lock fell out of her hand. after having somewhat recovered her surprise she took up the key locked the door and went upstairs into her chamber to recover herself but she could not she was so much frightened. next morning he asked her for the keys which she gave him but with such a trembling hand that he easily guessed what had happened. you were resolved to go into the closet were you not she would have melted a rock so beautiful and sorrowful was she but blue beard had a heart harder than any rock the distressed wife came down and threw herself at his feet all in tears with her hair about her shoulders. the poor lady turning about to him and looking at him with dying eyes desired him to afford her one little moment to recollect herself. the poor wife was almost as dead as her husband and had not strength enough to rise and welcome her brothers. and so they crossed the seas and journeyed till they reached the town where the princess of the golden roof dwelt. and as she was about to carry away the glittering water she turned round and saw the stranger and asked him who he was. she stepped on to the ship and the king led her inside. many hours passed thus and she was so happy that she did not notice that the ship was sailing away. he ceased playing and listened to what they were saying for he understood their language. but whos to do that but whats the good let him alone he is ever my most trusty john. of a sudden she grew deadly white and fell to the ground as if she were dead. my most trusty john pardon pardon then the king was full of joy and when he saw the queen coming he hid trusty john and the two children in a big cupboard. the brave little tailor 
one summers day a little tailor sat on his table by the window in the best of spirits and sewed for dear life. but the flies who didnt understand english refused to let themselves be warned off and returned again in even greater numbers. before he set forth he looked round about him to see if there was anything in the house he could take with him on his journey but he found nothing except an old cheese which he took possession of. im just on my way there. but first he thought hed test him so taking up a stone in his hand he squeezed it till some drops of water ran out. the giant didnt know what to say for he couldnt have believed it of the little fellow. to prove him again the giant lifted a stone and threw it so high that the eye could hardly follow it. but the little tailor was far too weak to hold the tree down and when the giant let go the tree swung back into the air bearing the little tailor with it. i jumped over the tree because the huntsmen are shooting among the branches near us. but the bed was too big for the little tailor so he didnt get into it but crept away into the corner. the little tailor continued to follow his nose and after he had wandered about for a long time he came to the courtyard of a royal palace and feeling tired he lay down on the grass and fell asleep. but he didnt dare to send him away for he feared he might kill him along with his people and place himself on the throne. he gave however as good as he got and they became so enraged that they tore up trees and beat each other with them till they both fell dead at once on the ground. then the little tailor jumped down. still the king didnt want to give him the promised reward and made a third demand. the tailor was to catch a wild boar for him that did a great deal of harm in the wood and he might have the huntsmen to help him. the little tailor summoned the huntsmen together that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes. so the wedding was celebrated with much splendor and little joy and the tailor became a king. that night he and his wife went to bed at the usual time and when she thought he had fallen asleep she got up opened the door and then lay down again. so the little tailor was and remained a king all the days of his life. twelve of our crew died from hard labor and bad food and the rest were in a very weak condition. i was extremely tired and with the heat of the weather i found myself much inclined to sleep. when i woke it was just daylight. i attempted to rise but could not for as i happened to be lying on my back i found my arms and legs were fastened on each side to the ground and my hair which was long and thick tied down in the same manner. i could only look upward. the sun began to grow hot and the light hurt my eyes. i heard a confused noise about me but could see nothing except the sky. in the meantime i felt at least forty more following the first. i was in the utmost astonishment and roared so loud that they all ran back in a fright and some of them were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground. however they soon returned and one of them who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face lifted up his hands in admiration. moreover they shot another flight into the air of which some fell on my face which i immediately covered with my left hand. from this one of them who seemed to be a person of quality made me a long speech of which i could not understand a word though i could tell from his manner that he sometimes threatened me and sometimes spoke with pity and kindness. they supplied me as fast as they could with a thousand marks of wonder at my appetite. i then made a sign that i wanted something to drink. however i could not wonder enough at the daring of these tiny mortals who ventured to mount and walk upon my body while one of my hands was free without trembling at the very sight of so huge a creature as i must have seemed to them. he seemed to understand me well enough for he shook his head though he made other signs to let me know that i should have meat and drink enough and very good treatment. it seems that when i was discovered sleeping on the ground after my landing the emperor had early notice of it and determined that i should be tied in the manner i have related which was done in the night while i slept that plenty of meat and drink should be sent me and a machine prepared to carry me to the capital city. but the difficulty was to place me on it. fifteen hundred of the emperors largest horses each about four inches and a half high were then employed to draw me toward the capital. but while all this was done i still lay in a deep sleep and i did not wake till four hours after we began our journey. where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple supposed to be the largest in the whole kingdom and here it was determined that i should lodge. then i rose up feeling as melancholy as ever i did in my life. the better to behold him i lay down on my side so that my face was level with his and he stood three yards off. however i have had him since many times in my hand and therefore cannot be deceived. his voice was shrill but very clear. but the colonel ordered six of them to be seized and delivered bound into my hands. i put five of them into my coat pocket and as to the sixth i made a face as if i would eat him alive. but i soon set them at ease for cutting the strings he was bound with i put him gently on the ground and away he ran. i treated the rest in the same manner taking them one by one out of my pocket and i saw that both the soldiers and people were delighted at this mark of my kindness. toward night i got with some difficulty into my house where i lay on the ground as i had to do for a fortnight till a bed was prepared for me out of six hundred beds of the ordinary measure. the first words i learned were to desire that he would please to give me my liberty which i every day repeated on my knees but he answered that this must be a work of time and that first i must swear a peace with him and his kingdom. he told me also that by the laws of the nation i must be searched by two of his officers and that as this could not be done without my help he trusted them in my hands and whatever they took from me should be returned when i left the country. i took up the two officers and put them into my coat pockets. in the left pocket we saw a huge silver chest with a silver cover which we could not lift. some of the white which appeared to be silver were so large and heavy that my comrade and i could hardly lift them. i amused the emperor one day in a very extraordinary manner. i took nine sticks and fixed them firmly in the ground in a square. i fastened my handkerchief to the nine sticks that stood erect and extended it on all sides till it was as tight as the top of a drum and i desired the emperor to let a troop of his best horse twentyfour in number come and exercise upon this plain. but i immediately relieved them both and covering the hole with one hand i set down the troop with the other as i had taken them up. however he agreed at length though he succeeded in himself drawing up the conditions on which i should be set free. he ordered his coach to wait at a distance and desired that i would give him an hours audience. the emperor and his whole court stood on the shore awaiting me. i asked them to present my most humble respects to the emperor their master whose royal person i resolved to attend before i returned to my own country. this he granted me but in a very cold manner of which i afterward learned the reason. it was commanded that the plan of starving you by degrees should be kept a secret but the sentence of putting out your eyes was entered on the books. but in this it soon appeared i was deceived. he said that as for sending me bound his brother knew it was impossible. in about a month i was ready to take leave. having thus prepared all things as well as i was able i set sail. however i took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket which after great astonishment clearly convinced him. the eldest was quite willing to go to the meadow he would watch the grass he said and he would do it so well that neither man nor beast nor even the devil himself should have any of it. so the next oldest son was willing to show what he could do. everything was quiet and everything stayed quiet and when he had lain still a short time he heard something that sounded as if a horse were standing chewing just outside the barn door. so he mounted it and rode away to a place which no one knew of but himself and there he tied it up. when he went home again his brothers laughed and asked how he had got on. then the boy rode this horse too away to the place where he kept the other and then went home again. then he mounted it and rode away to the place where he had the two others and then he went home again. they did go and this time too the grass was standing looking as fine and as thick as ever. upon the very top of this the kings daughter was to sit with three gold apples in her lap and the man who could ride up and take the three golden apples should marry her and have half the kingdom. the princess was very beautiful and all who saw her fell violently in love with her even in spite of themselves. when the two brothers got to the glass hill all the princes and knights were trying to ride up it and their horses were in a foam but it was all in vain for no sooner did the horses set foot upon the hill than down they slipped and there was not one which could get even so much as a couple of yards up. but they were all eager to win the kings daughter and half the kingdom so they rode and they slipped and thus it went on. the other knights all called out to him that he might just as well spare himself the trouble of trying to ride up the glass hill for it was of no use to try but he did not heed them and rode straight off to it and went up as if it were nothing at all. thus he rode for a long way it may have been a third part of the way up but when he had got so far he turned his horse round and rode down again. but when he had come down from off the hill he rode away and that so fast that no one knew what had become of him. but no one had anything to show. one knight presented himself after the other and none could show the apple. when they had tired out their horses so that they could do no more they again had to stop altogether. but nothing was to be seen of him. the princess liked this knight still better than she had liked the other and sat longing that he might be able to get up above and when she saw him turning back she threw the second apple after him and it rolled into his shoe and as soon as he had got down the glass hill he rode away so fast that no one could see what had become of him. in the evening when everyone was to appear before the king and princess in order that he who had the golden apple might show it one knight went in after the other but none of them had a golden apple to show. on the third day everything went just as on the former days. at last after a long time came a knight riding upon a horse that was such a fine one its equal had never yet been seen. he rode straight away to the glass hill and galloped up it as if it were no hill at all so that the princess had not even time to wish that he might get up the whole way. when the two brothers came home again at night they had much to tell of how the riding had gone off that day and at last they told about the knight in the golden armor too. next day all the knights and princes were to appear before the king and princess it had been too late for them to do it the night before in order that he who had the golden apple might produce it. they all went in turn first princes and then knights but none of them had a golden apple. they were the last of all so the king inquired of them if there was no one else in the kingdom left to come. the sultan paid them the money he promised them and that very day they gave orders for the preparations for their travels and took their leave of the sultan that they might be the more ready to go the next morning. at night when they were at supper together they all agreed to travel for a year and to meet at that inn and that the first that came should wait for the rest that as they had all three taken their leave together of the sultan they might all return together. the next morning by break of day after they had embraced and wished each other good success they mounted their horses and took each a different road. in short he looked upon it as an impossible thing for the princes his younger brothers to meet with anything to be compared with it. you shall judge yourself whether i am or no when i have told you its property and i hope you will value it at as high a price as those i have showed it to already who had as bad an opinion of me as you. when the princes met they showed each other their treasures and immediately saw through the glass that the princess was dying. they then sat down on the carpet wished themselves with her and were there in a moment. while the princess was dressing the princes went to throw themselves at the sultan their fathers feet and pay their respects to him. but as he could not imagine what had become of his arrow he stole away from his attendants and resolved to search after it that he might not have anything to reproach himself with. ii 
when prince ahmed came pretty nigh to these rocks he perceived an arrow which he gathered up looked earnestly at it and was in the greatest astonishment to find it was the same he shot away. but madam may i without being guilty of ill manners dare to ask you by what adventure you know me i could also charm you with my gardens but we will let that alone till another time. first i dont think it proper for you to tell the sultan your father of our marriage nor of my quality nor the place where you have been. as it was not a great way to his fathers capital prince ahmed soon arrived there. dont you remember the promise you made to go and see him often so he sent for a female magician who was introduced by a back door into his apartment. the magician seeing him coming followed him with her eyes till on a sudden she lost sight of him and his attendants. the magician who saw it was in vain for her to search any farther was obliged to be satisfied with the discovery she had made and returned to give the sultan an account. when she was laid down again the two women covered her up. prince ahmed never expected that the sultan his father would have asked such a thing which at first appeared so difficult not to say impossible. youll see presently that i am in earnest. when the tent was set up in the great plain which we have before mentioned he found it large enough to shelter an army twice as large as he could bring into the field. but the sultan was not yet satisfied. ill tell you presently the use of it. in the second place you must have two horses one you must ride yourself and the other you must lead which must be loaded with a sheep cut into four quarters that must be killed today. in the third place you must be provided with a bottle which i will give you to bring the water in. in short how can he suppose that i should lay hold of a man so well armed though he is but little the giant had done this for many years when jack resolved to destroy him. he covered the top over so as to make it look like solid ground. jack then returned home to cheer his friends with the news. soon after the giant went to fetch his brother who was likewise a giant to take a meal off his flesh and jack saw with terror through the bars of his prison the two giants approaching. as jack had but little money he went on as fast as possible. at length he came to a handsome house. jack said he was a traveler who had lost his way on which the giant made him welcome and let him into a room where there was a good bed to sleep in. jack took off his clothes quickly but though he was weary he could not go to sleep. he laid it in his own place in the bed and then hid himself in a dark corner of the room. early in the morning jack put a bold face upon the matter and walked into the giants room to thank him for his lodging. dear me is it you pray how did you sleep last night scarcely had he entered the forest when he beheld a monstrous giant dragging along by the hair of their heads a handsome knight and his lady. the knight and his lady thanked jack for their deliverance and invited him to their house to receive a proper reward for his services. jacks fame had now spread through the whole country and at the kings desire the duke gave him his daughter in marriage to the joy of all his kingdom. she bade her look out o her back door and see what she could see. they lifted her down and took her in and sent the bull to the field for the night. they lifted her down took her in and sent the bull to the field for the night. the bull returned and sought for but never could find her. so the young man set out to seek his fortune. this old man also told him to beware of the next beasts that he should meet for they were of a very different kind from any he had yet seen. and when he had got him out he told him that if he could answer him three questions his life should be spared. the second was whether man was made for woman or woman for man he told his mother that the time was now come for him to go away upon his travels also so she requested him to take the can to the well for water that she might bake a cake for him. so his mother gave him a can to go to the well and bring home water that she might bake him a cake for his journey. when he came to the place where the monstrous beasts were standing he did not stop nor run away but went boldly through among them. and then he put the three questions to him but the young man had been told everything by the good fairy so he was able to answer all the questions. next day they a set out for the kings court and a gallant company they made. no children you are mistaken. once upon a time there was a piece of wood. far from it. i do not know how this really happened yet the fact remains that one fine day this piece of wood found itself in the shop of an old carpenter. he turned frightened eyes about the room to find out where that wee little voice had come from and he saw no one he looked under the bench no one he peeped inside the closet no one he opened the door to look up and down the street and still no one might it be that this piece of wood has learned to weep and cry like a child i can hardly believe it. yet might someone be hidden in it if so the worse for him. he threw it to the floor against the walls of the room and even up to the ceiling. he waited two minutes nothing five minutes nothing ten minutes nothing. oh stop it ha ha ha when he opened his eyes he found himself sitting on the floor. his face had changed fright had turned even the tip of his nose from red to deepest purple. in that very instant a loud knock sounded on the door. thus having settled their accounts they shook hands and swore to be good friends for the rest of their lives. little as geppettos house was it was neat and comfortable. over the fire there was painted a pot full of something which kept boiling happily away and sending up clouds of what looked like real steam. as soon as he reached home geppetto took his tools and began to cut and shape the wood into a marionette. this name will make his fortune. after the eyes geppetto made the nose which began to stretch as soon as finished. in despair he let it alone. next he made the mouth. the mouth stopped laughing but it stuck out a long tongue. not wishing to start an argument geppetto made believe he saw nothing and went on with his work. after the mouth he made the chin then the neck the shoulders the stomach the arms and the hands. he glanced up and what did he see his yellow wig was in the marionettes hand. the legs and feet still had to be made. as soon as they were done geppetto felt a sharp kick on the tip of his nose. pinocchios legs were so stiff that he could not move them and geppetto held his hand and showed him how to put out one foot after the other. he came to the open door and with one leap he was out into the street. away he flew but the people in the street seeing a wooden marionette running like the wind stood still to stare and to laugh until they cried. the little old man wanted to pull pinocchios ears. think how he felt when upon searching for them he discovered that he had forgotten to make them all he could do was to seize pinocchio by the back of the neck and take him home. one person after another gathered around the two. some said one thing some another. i deserve it however very little time did it take to get poor old geppetto to prison. on reaching home he found the house door half open. he slipped into the room locked the door and threw himself on the floor happy at his escape. what i know is that tomorrow at dawn i leave this place forever. if i stay here the same thing will happen to me which happens to all other boys and girls. they are sent to school and whether they want to or not they must study. as for me let me tell you i hate to study perhaps he did not think he would strike it. but sad to relate my dear children he did hit the cricket straight on its head. if the crickets death scared pinocchio at all it was only for a very few moments. for as night came on a queer empty feeling at the pit of his stomach reminded the marionette that he had eaten nothing as yet. think how he felt his long nose became at least two inches longer. a bone left by a dog would have tasted good to him but he found nothing. and meanwhile his hunger grew and grew. if he were here now i wouldnt be so hungry it was an egg. it is impossible to describe it you must picture it to yourself. or shall i drink you in the pan instead of oil or butter he poured a little water. if i had not run away from home and if father were here now i should not be dying of hunger. pinocchio hated the dark street but he was so hungry that in spite of it he ran out of the house. the night was pitch black. pinocchio was greatly afraid of thunder and lightning but the hunger he felt was far greater than his fear. the whole village was dark and deserted. the stores were closed the doors the windows. in the streets not even a dog could be seen. it seemed the village of the dead. as he no longer had any strength left with which to stand he sat down on a little stool and put his two feet on the stove to dry them. there he fell asleep and while he slept his wooden feet began to burn. at dawn he opened his eyes just as a loud knocking sounded at the door. it was the voice of geppetto. in falling he made as much noise as a sack of wood falling from the fifth story of a house. oh dear oh dear at first he was very angry but on seeing pinocchio stretched out on the floor and really without feet he felt very sad and sorrowful. the thunder was so noisy and the lightning so bright and i was hungry. and then the talking cricket said to me you deserve it you were bad and i said to him careful cricket and he said to me you are a marionette and you have a wooden head and i threw the hammer at him and killed him. it was his own fault for i didnt want to kill him. oh oh bad very bad i am better than all of them and i always tell the truth. when poverty shows itself even mischievous boys understand what it means. after a while he returned. the poor fellow was in his shirt sleeves and the day was cold. then clever as i am i can earn a lot of money. cloth did i say no it shall be of gold and silver with diamond buttons. on this cold day too . he stopped to listen. those sounds came from a little street that led to a small village along the shore. otherwise. . he felt he had to make up his mind for either one thing or another. should he go to school or should he follow the pipes no sooner said than done. he started down the street going like the wind. . suddenly he found himself in a large square full of people standing in front of a little wooden building painted in brilliant colors. then ill read it to you. he hesitated he wondered he could not make up his mind. then and there the book changed hands. the curtain was up and the performance had started. am i asleep or awake it is our brother pinocchio with a third he landed on the stage. he had such a fearful appearance that one look at him would fill you with horror. his beard was as black as pitch and so long that it reached from his chin down to his feet. one could almost hear a fly go by. be quiet more wood was needed to finish cooking it. then frightened by a look from their master they left the kitchen to obey him. i dont want to die the way was just as good as any other to show the kindness of his heart. poor old man i feel sorry for him however i ought to be sorry for myself too just now. my good dinner is spoiled. i have no more wood for the fire and the lamb is only half cooked. never mind in your place ill burn some other marionette. hey there i have spared you. come officers tie me up and throw me on those flames. even the officers who were made of wood also cried like two babies. i feel sorry for him. here take these five gold pieces. the lame fox leaned on the cat and the blind cat let the fox lead him along. if he had only kept his words to himself after eating the bird he cleaned his whiskers closed his eyes and became blind once more. he talks too much. home is near and im going where father is waiting for me. how unhappy he must be that i have not yet returned i have learned this at my own expense. . . . . . in this field you dig a hole and in the hole you bury a gold piece. however not one of them was very hungry. that was all. he felt ill he said and could not eat another bite. pinocchio ate least of all. he asked for a bite of bread and a few nuts and then hardly touched them. before starting out well take a little nap. he dreamed he was in the middle of a field. it was the innkeeper who had come to tell him that midnight had struck. he walked on not knowing where he was going for it was dark so dark that not a thing was visible. round about him not a leaf stirred. who goes there who goes. . . once again the road was plunged in darkness. if we were to allow it everyone would try to be father and mother to us everyone even the talking cricket. take me for example. at least i have never believed in them nor ever will. and then even if i were to meet them on the road what matter remember that you cant fool with me but in case they dont run away i can always run myself. . the two figures leaped toward him as softly as if they were ghosts. so thats the game you have the money hidden under your tongue. all was of no use. they would not open. fancy his surprise when he saw that it was not a hand but a cats paw. seeing himself lost he climbed up a giant pine tree and sat there to see what he could see. they gathered a bundle of wood piled it up at the foot of the pine and set fire to it. pinocchio saw the flames climb higher and higher. what was there to do they fell right into the middle of the pool. suddenly he saw a little cottage gleaming white as the snow among the trees of the forest. after a hard race of almost an hour tired and out of breath pinocchio finally reached the door of the cottage and knocked. no one answered. the same silence followed. at the noise a window opened and a lovely maiden looked out. her eyes were closed and her hands crossed on her breast. ah you do not answer happily for him pinocchio was made of very hard wood and the knives broke into a thousand pieces. throwing the rope over the high limb of a giant oak tree they pulled till the poor marionette hung far up in space. but after three hours the marionettes eyes were still open his mouth still shut and his legs kicked harder than ever. a few minutes went by and then a wild wind started to blow. death was creeping nearer and nearer and the marionette still hoped for some good soul to come to his rescue but no one appeared. he closed his eyes opened his mouth stretched out his legs and hung there as if he were dead. fly immediately to him. in a quarter of an hour the coach was back. one after another the doctors came a crow and owl and a talking cricket. however that marionette is not a stranger to me. think how surprised everyone was when on raising the sheets they discovered pinocchio half melted in tears afterwards he tells a lie and in punishment his nose grows longer and longer. as soon as the three doctors had left the room the fairy went to pinocchios bed and touching him on the forehead noticed that he was burning with fever. he lifted it to his mouth and once more stuck his nose into it. i smell it. i wont. i wont quick please i dont want to die in a twinkling pinocchio felt fine. with one leap he was out of bed and into his clothes. when i awoke they were gone and i started out in the darkness all alone. as he spoke his nose long though it was became at least two inches longer. the fairy sat looking at him and laughing. no matter how he tried it would not go through the door. but when she saw him pale with fright and with his eyes half out of his head from terror she began to feel sorry for him and clapped her hands together. he was right. oh my poor friend the cat tried to answer but he became so terribly twisted in his speech that the fox had to help him out. ill answer for him. about an hour ago we met an old wolf on the road. he was half starved and begged for help. having nothing to give him what do you think my friend did out of the kindness of his heart why dont you listen to me will you come with us well be there in half an hour. then he ended by doing what all boys do when they have no heart and little brain. he dug the hole put the four gold pieces into it and covered them up very carefully. if the marionette had been told to wait a day instead of twenty minutes the time could not have seemed longer to him. he walked impatiently to and fro and finally turned his nose toward the field of wonders. or if instead of two thousand i should find five thousand or one hundred thousand but he saw nothing he took a few steps forward and still nothing he stepped into the field. he went up to the place where he had dug the hole and buried the gold pieces. again nothing as he did so he heard a hearty burst of laughter close to his head. i too believed that once and today i am very sorry for it. today but too late they took the four gold pieces which you have buried and ran away as fast as the wind. he would not believe the parrots words and began to dig away furiously at the earth. he dug and he dug till the hole was as big as himself but no money was there. every penny was gone. the judge listened to him with great patience. a kind look shone in his eyes. he became very much interested in the story he felt moved he almost wept. when the marionette had no more to say the judge put out his hand and rang a bell. there he had to remain for four long weary months. and if it had not been for a very lucky chance he probably would have had to stay there longer. taking off his cap he bowed low and opened the door of the prison and pinocchio ran out and away with never a look backward. fancy the happiness of pinocchio on finding himself free without saying yes or no he fled from the city and set out on the road that was to take him back to the house of the lovely fairy. but he kept on bravely. i will always have my own way. i wonder if father is waiting for me. will i find him at the fairys house it is so long poor man since i have seen him and i do so want his love and his kisses. and will the fairy ever forgive me for all i have done she who has been so good to me and to whom i owe my life what was the matter how frightened was poor pinocchio the serpent never moved. it is so long since i have seen him on the contrary the green serpent who had seemed until then wide awake and full of life became suddenly very quiet and still. his eyes closed and his tail stopped smoking. without a moments hesitation he started to step over him but he had just raised one leg when the serpent shot up like a spring and the marionette fell head over heels backward. pinocchio freed himself from his awkward position and once more began to run in order to reach the fairys house before dark. woe to him went his legs. pinocchio as you may well imagine began to scream and weep and beg but all was of no use for no houses were to be seen and not a soul passed by on the road. night came on. tomorrow well settle matters. a long iron chain was tied to the collar. yes i deserve it i have never obeyed anyone and i have always done as i pleased. oh if i could start all over again poor beast he was so good digging busily with teeth and claws they opened the little door and slipped in. the one who had done the trick was pinocchio who not satisfied with that dragged a heavy stone in front of it. that done he started to bark. i could punish you now but ill wait in the morning you may come with me to the inn and there youll make a fine dinner for some hungry mortal. the dead are gone and they cannot defend themselves. he became terribly frightened and running as fast as he could he finally came to the spot where it had once stood. the little house was no longer there. he fell to the ground and covering the cold marble with kisses burst into bitter tears. why did i not die who am so bad instead of you who are so good and my father where can he be please dear fairy tell me where he is and i shall never never leave him again you are not really dead are you if you love me you will come back alive as before. dont you feel sorry for me im so lonely. what shall i do alone in the world now that you are dead and my father is lost where shall i eat where shall i sleep who will make my new clothes oh i want to die yes i want to die he even tried to tear his hair but as it was only painted on his wooden head he could not even pull it. just then a large pigeon flew far above him. he was much larger than a turkey. hes my father my poor dear father has he perhaps spoken to you of me will you take me to him is he still alive answer me please not at all. the marionette looked to see what was below them. his head swam and he was so frightened that he clutched wildly at the pigeons neck to keep himself from falling. they flew all day. pinocchio jumped off the pigeons back and the pigeon not wanting any thanks for a kind deed flew away swiftly and disappeared. and pinocchio standing on a high rock tired out with searching waved to him with hand and cap and even with his nose. it looked as if geppetto though far away from the shore recognized his son for he took off his cap and waved also. he seemed to be trying to make everyone understand that he would come back if he were able but the sea was so heavy that he could do nothing with his oars. suddenly a huge wave came and the boat disappeared. they waited and waited for it but it was gone. just then a desperate cry was heard. in a twinkling he was far away from land. at last he was completely lost to view. and what a horrible night it was at dawn he saw not far away from him a long stretch of sand. it was an island in the middle of the sea. pinocchio tried his best to get there but he couldnt. the sun came out in full splendor and the sea became as calm as a lake. then the marionette took off his clothes and laid them on the sand to dry. he looked over the waters to see whether he might catch sight of a boat with a little man in it. he searched and he searched but he saw nothing except sea and sky and far away a few sails so small that they might have been birds. but whom shall i ask after walking a half hour he came to a small country called the land of the busy bees. everyone worked everyone had something to do. what was to be done there were only two means left to him in order to get a bite to eat. he had either to work or to beg. all others should work and if they didnt and went hungry so much the worse for them. pinocchio did not eat he devoured. tell me that it is you dont make me cry any longer if you only knew you left me when i was a little girl and now you find me a grown woman. for a long time i have wanted a mother just like other boys. i also want to grow a little. look at me i want to become a good boy and be a comfort to my father. he grasped the fairys hands and kissed them so hard that it looked as if he had lost his head. there is always hope for boys with hearts such as yours though they may often be very mischievous. this is the reason why i have come so far to look for you. a man remember whether rich or poor should do something in this world. no one can find happiness without work. in the morning bright and early pinocchio started for school. they laughed until they cried. everyone played tricks on him. one even attempted to tie strings to his feet and his hands to make him dance. for a while pinocchio was very calm and quiet. with that kick and that blow pinocchio gained everybodys favor. pinocchios only fault was that he had too many friends. those bad companions will sooner or later make you lose your love for study. you can go there tomorrow. at the signal the little troop with books under their arms dashed across the fields. pinocchio led the way running as if on wings the others following as fast as they could. now and again he looked back and seeing his followers hot and tired and with tongues hanging out he laughed out heartily. unhappy boy one is wounded. pinocchio is arrested. going like the wind pinocchio took but a very short time to reach the shore. he glanced all about him but there was no sign of a shark. the sea was as smooth as glass. from the answers and the laughter which followed them pinocchio understood that the boys had played a trick on him. if you study and we dont we pay for it. you may not be afraid of us but remember we are not afraid of you either and with the words he gave pinocchio a terrible blow on the head. wherever they landed they left their painful mark and the boys could only run away and howl. enraged at not being able to fight the marionette at close quarters they started to throw all kinds of books at him. but pinocchio was keen of eye and swift of movement and the books only passed over his head landed in the sea and disappeared. the fish thinking they might be good to eat came to the top of the water in great numbers. he might as well have spoken to the wind. go to bed and sleep it was pinocchios pride. among all his books he liked that one the best. at the sight of that pale little corpse the boys were so frightened that they turned tail and ran. in a few moments all had disappeared. all except pinocchio. open your eyes and look at me why dont you answer i was not the one who hit you you know. believe me i didnt do it. if you keep them shut ill die too. oh dear me how shall i ever go home now how shall i ever look at my little mother again what will happen to me where shall i go where shall i hide oh how much better it would have been a thousand times better if only i had gone to school why did i listen to those boys they always were a bad influence and to think that the teacher had told me and my mother too beware of bad company thats what she said. i listen but always i do as i wish. and then i pay. ive never had a moments peace since ive been born oh dear what will become of me again and again he called to his little friend when suddenly he heard heavy steps approaching. the marionette walked swiftly along the road to the village. but the poor fellow hardly knew what he was about. he felt ill. his eyes saw everything double his legs trembled his tongue was dry and try as he might he could not utter a single word. pinocchio ran fast and the dog ran faster. but they were disappointed for the dog and pinocchio raised so much dust on the road that after a few moments it was impossible to see them. as soon as he set foot on the beach pinocchio gave a leap and fell into the water. strange though it may seem the dog could not swim. he beat the water with his paws to hold himself up but the harder he tried the deeper he sank. i promise the poor dog was so weak he could not stand. however pinocchio not wishing to trust him too much threw himself once again into the sea. you did me a good turn and in this world what is given is always returned. at last he thought he had reached a safe place. so much the better. he tried to escape but he was too late. at the same time he saw a fisherman come out of the cave a fisherman so ugly that pinocchio thought he was a sea monster. in place of hair his head was covered by a thick bush of green grass. green was the skin of his body green were his eyes green was the long long beard that reached down to his feet. after that he threw them into a large empty tub. many times he repeated this performance. the last to come out of the net was pinocchio. a crab indeed i am no such thing. beware how you deal with me so much the better. but cant you understand that im not a fish do you think that i want to lose the opportunity to taste such a rare fish a marionette fish does not come very often to these seas. leave it to me. i know youll like it. oh oh then he pulled a wooden bowl full of flour out of a cupboard and started to roll the fish into it one by one. when they were white with it he threw them into the pan. pinocchios turn came last. seeing himself so near to death and such a horrible death he began to tremble so with fright that he had no voice left with which to beg for his life. then he took him by the head and . . . he closed his eyes and waited for the final moment. and he drew back his foot to give the dog a kick. then what did he do with one great leap he grasped that bundle in his mouth and holding it lightly between his teeth ran through the door and disappeared like a flash then they bid each other goodby and the dog went home. all the wonderful things i have said are not true at all. if you want it take it. he took the bag which happened to be empty and after cutting a big hole at the top and two at the sides he slipped into it as if it were a shirt. along the way he felt very uneasy. what will she say when she sees me will she forgive this last trick of mine i am sure she wont. oh no she wont. and i deserve it as usual pinocchio went straight to the fairys house firmly resolved to knock at the door. when he found himself there he lost courage and ran back a few steps. a second time he came to the door and again he ran back. a third time he repeated his performance. he waited and waited and waited. at that second knock a window on the third floor opened and the same snail looked out. and two hours on a dreadful night like this are as long as two years. a few minutes later midnight struck then one oclock two oclock. and the door still remained closed he kicked so hard that his foot went straight through the door and his leg followed almost to the knee. poor pinocchio the rest of the night he had to spend with one foot through the door and the other one in the air. as dawn was breaking the door finally opened. that brave little animal the snail had taken exactly nine hours to go from the fourth floor to the street. at the sight of all these good things the marionette felt much better. instead either from pain or weakness he fell to the floor in a dead faint. only remember to return home before dark. in a little more than an hour all his friends were invited. some accepted quickly and gladly. he went a second time and again a third but still without success. where could he be pinocchio searched here and there and everywhere and finally discovered him hiding near a farmers wagon. believe me if you dont come youll be sorry. where can you find a place that will agree better with you and me in that blessed place there is no such thing as study. in the land of toys every day except sunday is a saturday. that is the place for me all countries should be like it at night one goes to bed and next morning the good times begin all over again. yes or no i have promised my kind fairy to become a good boy and i want to keep my word. just see the sun is setting and i must leave you and run. oh h h finally the wagon arrived. it made no noise for its wheels were bound with straw and rags. and the driver of the wagon no sooner did any boy see him than he fell in love with him and nothing satisfied him but to be allowed to ride in his wagon to that lovely place called the land of toys. i could not permit such a thing. no sooner said than done. he approached the first donkey and tried to mount it. but the little animal turned suddenly and gave him such a terrible kick in the stomach that pinocchio was thrown to the ground and fell with his legs in the air. the little fat man did not laugh. in the meantime pinocchio lifted himself up from the ground and with one leap landed on the donkeys back. again the boys shouted with laughter. but the little man instead of laughing became so loving toward the little animal that with another kiss he bit off half of his left ear. you have done as you wished. oh how well i know this how well i can prove it to you he jumped to the ground ran up to the donkey on whose back he had been riding and taking his nose in his hands looked at him. think how great was his surprise when he saw that the donkey was weeping weeping just like a boy mount quickly and let us go. the wagon started again. this great land was entirely different from any other place in the world. the oldest were about fourteen years of age the youngest eight. no more school they became everybodys friend. who could be happier than they do you admit it if today i am a really happy boy it is all because of you. but my children there came a morning when pinocchio awoke and found a great surprise awaiting him a surprise which made him feel very unhappy as you shall see. everyone at one time or another has found some surprise awaiting him. what was it he found that during the night his ears had grown at least ten full inches you must know that the marionette even from his birth had very small ears so small indeed that to the naked eye they could hardly be seen. he went in search of a mirror but not finding any he just filled a basin with water and looked at himself. there he saw what he never could have wished to see. i leave you to think of the terrible grief the shame the despair of the poor marionette. and tears now are useless. i wanted to return home. why do you want to go to school come with me to the land of toys. there well never study again. oh if i had only had a bit of heart i should never have abandoned that good fairy who loved me so well and who has been so kind to me and by this time i should no longer be a marionette. i should have become a real boy like all these friends of mine but when he reached it remembering his donkey ears he felt ashamed to show them to the public and turned back. he took a large cotton bag from a shelf put it on his head and pulled it far down to his very nose. thus adorned he went out. he asked everyone whom he met about him but no one had seen him. another surprise awaited pinocchio there in the room stood his friend with a large cotton bag on his head pulled far down to his very nose. two and then a scene took place which is hard to believe but it is all too true. i am the little man the driver of the wagon which brought you here. outside the room the little man grew more and more impatient and finally gave the door such a violent kick that it flew open. in fact he did not have to wait very long for an offer. and now do you understand what the little mans profession was this horrid little being whose face shone with kindness went about the world looking for boys. lazy boys boys who hated books boys who wanted to run away from home boys who were tired of school all these were his joy and his fortune. he took them with him to the land of toys and let them enjoy themselves to their hearts content. my dear children i do not know. but pinocchio did not like that any better. at that second beating pinocchio became very quiet and said no more. after that the door of the stable was closed and he was left alone. just now instead of hay i should be eating some good bread and butter. he had eaten it all during the night. patience oh no you are to help me earn some fine gold pieces do you hear come along now. he was a handsome donkey indeed observe i beg of you the savage look of his eye. with all my kindness however i never succeeded in gaining my donkeys love. he is still today as savage as the day i found him. before i leave you i wish to state that there will be another performance tomorrow night. as he ran the master raised his arm and a pistol shot rang in the air. at the shot the little donkey fell to the ground as if he were really dead. at all that noise pinocchio lifted his head and raised his eyes. there in front of him in a box sat a beautiful woman. and what was his grief when on looking up toward the boxes he saw that the fairy had disappeared the fourth time at a look from his master he leaped through it but as he did so his hind legs caught in the ring and he fell to the floor in a heap. we want pinocchio no one saw pinocchio again that evening. i want only his skin. pinocchio sank immediately. not at all dear master. dont laugh at me one beautiful morning i awoke to find myself changed into a donkey long ears gray coat even a tail i hope you will never experience one like it dear master. one night during a performance i had a bad fall and became lame. but feeling sorry for me you tied a stone to my neck and threw me to the bottom of the sea. that was very good and kind of you to want me to suffer as little as possible and i shall remember you always. they thought i was really a dead donkey and began to eat me. here dear master you have my story. but as he spoke he gave a quick leap and dived into the sea. after swimming for a long time pinocchio saw a large rock in the middle of the sea a rock as white as marble. there was something very strange about that little goat. pinocchios heart beat fast and then faster and faster. do you know what it was poor pinocchio the sight of that monster frightened him almost to death he tried to swim away from him to change his path to escape but that immense mouth kept coming nearer and nearer. the monster will get you there he is there he is he came close to the rock. the goat leaned over and gave him one of her hoofs to help him up out of the water. alas it was too late. when he recovered his senses the marionette could not remember where he was. he listened for a few moments and heard nothing. once in a while a cold wind blew on his face. he chased me and swallowed me without even a by your leave read this chapter my children and you will know. he found a little table set for dinner and lighted by a candle stuck in a glass bottle and near the table sat a little old man white as the snow eating live fish. at this sight the poor marionette was filled with such great and sudden happiness that he almost dropped in a faint. at last with a great effort he was able to let out a scream of joy and opening wide his arms he threw them around the old mans neck. have i found you at last it is i look at me oh my dear father how good you are and to think that i oh but if you only knew how many misfortunes have fallen on my head and how many troubles i have had i ran and they ran after me always after me till they hanged me to the branch of a giant oak tree. it grew and it grew till i couldnt get it through the door of the room. and then i went with the fox and the cat to the field of wonders to bury the gold pieces. the parrot laughed at me and instead of two thousand gold pieces i found none. she was dead and the pigeon seeing me crying said to me i have seen your father building a boat to look for you in america and i said to him oh if i only had wings and he said to me do you want to go to your father and i said perhaps but how
and he said get on my back. where did you find the candle when they reached the throat of the monster they stopped for a while to wait for the right moment in which to make their escape. because of this pinocchio was able to catch a glimpse of the sky filled with stars as he looked up through the open jaws of his new home. the sea is calm and the night is as bright as day. they climbed up the throat of the monster till they came to that immense open mouth. the tongue was so wide and so long that it looked like a country road. to make matters worse the candle went out and father and son were left in the dark. they then crossed the whole tongue and jumped over three rows of teeth. who knows perhaps a little of both. he felt he could not go on much longer and the shore was still far away. hang onto my tail both of you and let me lead you. not in the least. as soon as they reached the shore pinocchio was the first to jump to the ground to help his old father. it was the fox and the cat but one could hardly recognize them they looked so miserable. the cat after pretending to be blind for so many years had really lost the sight of both eyes. that sly thief had fallen into deepest poverty and one day he had been forced to sell his beautiful tail for a bite to eat. pinocchio turned the key and the door opened. as soon as they went in they looked here and there and everywhere but saw no one. throw a hammer at me now. i deserve it . after he had cried a long time he wiped his eyes and then he made a bed of straw for old geppetto. he has some cows. he had never worked so hard in his life. he was worn out from hunger and too much work. from that day on for more than five months pinocchio got up every morning just as dawn was breaking and went to the farm to draw water. and every day he was given a glass of warm milk for his poor old father who grew stronger and better day by day. but he was not satisfied with this. he learned to make baskets of reeds and sold them. with the money he received he and his father were able to keep from starving. with it he wanted to buy himself a new suit. what is she doing does she remember me does she still love me is she very far away from here oh how sorry i am my poor dear little fairy if i had a million i should run to her with it here they are. i was just going to buy some clothes. i should like to sell these rags i have on to help her more. go and hurry. come back here within a couple of days and i hope to have more money for you until today i have worked for my father. now i shall have to work for my mother also. after that he went to bed and fell asleep. in reward for your kind heart i forgive you for all your old mischief. what was his surprise and his joy when on looking himself over he saw that he was no longer a marionette but that he had become a real live boy he looked all about him and instead of the usual walls of straw he found himself in a beautifully furnished little room the prettiest he had ever seen. in a twinkling he jumped down from his bed to look on the chair standing near. there he found a new suit a new hat and a pair of shoes. pinocchio ran to the mirror. he hardly recognized himself. surrounded by so much splendor the marionette hardly knew what he was doing. he rubbed his eyes two or three times wondering if he were still asleep or awake and decided he must be awake. under          broke          does           keep           only           turkey           warm           ugly           water 
a duck made her nest under some leaves. she sat on the eggs to keep them warm. at last the eggs broke one after the other. little ducks came out. only one egg was left. it was a very large one. said the old duck. can he be a turkey we will see. splash splash the mother duck was in the water. they all jumped in and began to swim. he is my own little duck. i want you to see the other ducks. they all went into the duck yard. what a noise the ducks made they are all pretty but one. the hens all bit him. the big ducks walked on him. he did not want to be so ugly. but he could not help it. he ran to hide under some bushes. the little birds in the bushes were afraid and flew away. so he ran away. at night he came to an old house. the house looked as if it would fall down. it was so old. an old woman lived there with her cat and her hen. the next day he went for a walk. he saw a big pond. but all of the animals made fun of him. he was so ugly. summer        away            cake           winter        swans           spring           flew          bread           leaves 
the summer went by. then the leaves fell and it was very cold. it is too sad to tell what he did all winter. at last it was spring. the birds sang. one day he flew far away. soon he saw three white swans on the lake. he put his head down to the water. what did he see he saw himself in the water. but he was not an ugly duck. he was a white swan. the other swans came to see him. and they gave him bread and cake. the little pine tree 
          pine          leaves          other           woods         needles         better           fairy         gold            sleep 
a little pine tree was in the woods. it had no leaves. it had needles. all the other trees in the woods have pretty leaves. i want leaves too. but i will have better leaves. night came and the little tree went to sleep. a fairy came by and gave it gold leaves. woke          cried           glass           little        again           pretty 
when the little tree woke it had leaves of gold. night came. a man came by with a bag. he saw the gold leaves. he took them all and put them into his bag.        
          night         sunshine        bright           looked        wind            blew 
so the little tree went to sleep. the fairy came by and put the glass leaves on it. the little tree woke and saw its glass leaves. how pretty they looked in the sunshine then a wind came up. it blew and blew. the glass leaves all fell from the tree and were broken. again         green           goat          hungry 
again the little tree had no leaves. i want green leaves. and the little tree went to sleep. when it woke it was like other trees. it had green leaves. a goat came by. he saw the green leaves on the little tree. the goat was hungry and he ate all the leaves. i will not have green leaves nor glass leaves nor gold leaves. and the little tree went to sleep. the fairy gave it what it wanted. when it woke it had its needles again. then the little pine tree was happy. the little match girl. almost        match           across           dark          running         bare           year          slippers        fell 
it was very cold. the snow fell and it was almost dark. it was the last day of the year. a little match girl was running in the street. she had no hat on. her feet were bare. but they were so large that she lost them when she ran across the street. she had a little bunch in her hand. but she could not sell her matches. no one would buy them. she was cold and hungry. the snow fell on her curly hair. but she did not think about that. she saw lights in the houses. she was afraid to go home. she knew her papa would whip her if she did not take some money to him. it was as cold at home as in the street. they were too poor to have a fire. they had to put rags in the windows to keep out the wind. she had to sleep on a pile of rags.        
          frozen        candle          sitting           lighted       thought         stove           near          think           step 
she sat down on a door step. her little hands were almost frozen. she took a match and lighted it to warm her hands. the match looked like a little candle. it was so bright. she put the match near her feet to warm them. then the light went out. she did not think that she was by the stove any more. now she thought she could look into a room. in this room was a table. a white cloth and pretty dishes were on the table. there was a roast turkey too. it was cooked and ready to eat. the knife and fork were in his back. the turkey jumped from the dish and ran to the little girl. the light went out and she was in the cold and dark again. then she thought she was sitting by a christmas tree. very many candles were on the tree. it was full of pretty things. the light went out. the lights on the christmas tree went up up until she saw they were the stars. but she was dead. the little girl lighted another match. it made a big light. she never looked so pretty before. she looked so sweet and happy. when the light goes out you will go away. the matches made it very light. they went up up where they would never be cold or hungry. they were with god. some men found a little girl in the street. she was dead. in her hand were the burned matches. they did not know how happy she was in heaven. little red ridinghood. red ridinghood was very glad to go. she put the things into her little basket and ran off.        
          wolf          mill            shall           going         first           wood 
when red ridinghood came to the wood she met a big wolf. said the wolf. said the wolf. the wolf made his voice as soft as he could. the wolf pulled the string and the door opened. he ran in and ate the poor old lady. then he jumped into her bed and put on her cap. then the cruel wolf jumped up and ate poor little red ridinghood.        
          just          hunter          scream           killed        heard           open 
just then a hunter came by. he heard red ridinghood scream. the hunter ran into the house and killed the old wolf. hood. once          hills           field           journey       rocks           cattle           walked        pieces          three 
once upon a time three of the gods went on a journey. loki was ugly and mean. the gods liked to walk over the hills and rocks. they could go very fast for they were so big. the gods walked on and on. at last they got very hungry. then they came to a field with cattle. meat          share           talking           cross         eagle           right 
they made a big fire but the meat would not cook. they made the fire bigger and bigger but the meat would not cook. then the gods were very cross. the gods looked to see who was talking. there in an oak tree was a big eagle. supper        stuck           enough           minute        claws           stones           pole          against         flew 
the supper was ready in a minute. then the eagle flew down to get his share. this made loki cross for he was very hungry. he took a long pole to hit the eagle. but the pole stuck to the eagles claws. the other end stuck to loki. then the eagle flew away. he did not fly high. he flew just high enough for loki to hit against the stones. and the eagle hit him against the stones. then loki knew the eagle was a giant and not a bird. this giant had a suit of eagles feathers. he was flying in his eagle suit when he saw loki. when the gods felt they were growing old they ate the apples and were young again. the giant wanted to be like the gods. loki and the eagle went to the city. the eagle stayed by the gate but loki went into the city. she was putting the apples into a beautiful golden box. it is only a little way. he picked her up in his claws. then he flew away with her to his home. the gods did not have the golden apples to eat so they began to get old. he did not tell a story that time. he looked like a big bird flying. when loki came to the giants home he was glad the giant was not there. the golden apples were gone too. then the giant put on his eagle suit and flew after loki. loki heard the eagle coming. loki flew faster. the eagle flew faster and faster. then the gods got on the walls to look for loki. they saw him coming and the eagle after him. so they made fires on the walls. at last loki flew over the walls. then the gods lighted the fires. the eagle flew into the fire and was burned. the gods ate the beautiful golden apples and were young again. she went out on the porch and fell asleep. loki came along. he was always playing tricks. then she ran to hide. at last he found her crying. somebody has cut it off. it was a man. he is always getting into mischief. pretty soon he found him. it was very dark down there. the only light came from the dwarfs fires. the dwarfs were ugly little black men. they were not any bigger than your thumb. they had crooked backs and crooked legs. so the busy little dwarfs worked all night. morning       showed          laughed           spear         wonderful       three           ship          standing        brother           nobody        stepped         else 
when morning came the dwarfs gave loki his crown of golden hair. they gave him a spear and a ship too. then the gods all came up to him. he showed them the things. he heard loki say that. this made the dwarfs angry. their eyes grew big. a ship that can go anywhere. a little fly came in and bit him on the hand. he took out a golden pig from the fire. stand         lump            ring 
he next put a lump of gold into the fire. then the same fly came in and bit him again. the same mean fly came again and bit him on the forehead. it bit so hard that the blood ran into his eyes. he took the hammer out of the fire. all the gods came around to see. then loki came up to show his things. then he took out the ship. loki felt very proud for he thought his things were the best. they thought lokis things were fine. it can go faster than any horse. when i was making it loki turned himself into a fly and made me spoil it. the fly bit me so hard that i had to stop blowing. so the handle is a little short. but it is a wonderful hammer. the gods picked up the hammer and passed it around. the hammer lost and found. everything    planned 
the frost giants did not like the sunshine. they did not like to see the flowers. they did not like to hear the birds sing. they wanted to spoil everything. but they did not know how. they talked and planned all night. i will dress in a bird suit. he took the hammer and flew away with it. it was gone. the frost giants have taken it. if i had a gold suit you could have it. he flew over the city. all the people saw him flying. they did not know that it was loki going for the hammer. it is buried eight miles deep in the ground. and she was very angry. she shook so hard that she broke her necklace and it fell to the floor. you will all laugh at me. the dinner was ready on time. the table was full of good things. all sat down. said the frost giants. she was so glad to come. fire flew from it. the fire burned the house and the frost giants ran away. the story of the sheep. he had two little children a boy and a girl. they were good children and loved each other very much. one day they were playing in the garden. said the boy. there on the grass was a fine large sheep. this sheep had a fleece of gold and his horns were gold too. when they went near he ran away on the clouds. grew          golden          hold           tame          ride            tight 
every day they played in the garden and every day the sheep came too. first he helped his sister on the sheeps back. then he got on and held to the horns. the boy felt very bad to lose his sister but went right on. he killed the sheep and gave the golden fleece to the king. by the tree was a dragon. the dragon never went to sleep. he would not let any one but the king come to the tree. so no one could get the golden fleece. he lived a little way from the kings city. one day the king gave a big party and invited jason. when he came to the kings house he had but one shoe. so he knew jason was to be king. jason was glad to go and asked many brave men to go with him. to get the golden fleece they would have to fight wild men and animals. there were two strong men on the ship. they had wings and could fly. this poor king had a hard time. they had claws of iron and scratched people when they tried to drive them away. when jason and his men came the king told them all about it. jason said they would help him. food          drowned         tired           swords        hurt            flying 
they all sat down to the table. jason and his men took their swords. then the two men with wings flew up in the air. the men flew after them. then the men with wings came back. now the blind king could eat all he wanted. the king thanked them over and over again for helping him. when they said goodbye he told them how to get to the land where they would find the golden fleece. on the sea where jason and his men had to sail were two big rocks. they were as high as a big hill. they would come close to each other then they would go far apart. fishes        pieces          dove           past          break           together           row           almost          rocks 
when fishes swam in the water the rocks would come together and kill the fishes. if birds flew in the air the rocks would come together and kill birds. if a boat sailed on the water the rocks would come together and break the boat into little pieces. these rocks had been put in the sea so no one could go to the land where the golden fleece was. the rocks came together when the dove was almost past. then they went far apart. jason made his men row as hard as they could. the rocks began to come together. just as they got past the rocks hit but jason and his men were all right. the brass bulls. the king wanted to keep the fleece. the brass bulls looked like real bulls but they were larger and stronger. they had to be tied with strong iron chains. daughter      medea           carriage           snakes        through         pulled 
when the dragons teeth were planted iron men grew up. they always killed the one who had planted them. the king wanted the bulls to kill jason. the king had a daughter named medea. she saw jason was a brave young man and did not want him killed. she knew how to help him. she stepped into her carriage which was pulled by flying snakes. then medea flew through the air. she took the flowers home and cooked them. when he did this he was as strong as a giant. nothing could hurt him then. fire could not burn him and swords could not cut him. they had good seats where they could see well. the little boys climbed the trees so they could see better. then jason came to the place. the door was opened and jason went in. pushed        kicked          until 
the bulls were very angry and blew fire and smoke from their mouths. this made the cruel king glad. but the people who saw it were afraid. they did not want jason killed. they did not know that the princess had helped him. jason pushed the bulls heads down to the ground. then they kicked at him with their feet but could not hurt him. handle        slowly          noon           wheat         lie             just 
jason took the chains in one hand. the bulls jumped and wanted to run away. but jason held so hard they had to go very slowly. then jason let the bulls go. they were so angry that they ran away to the woods. the king gave him his hat full. then jason planted the dragons teeth just as a man plants wheat. by this time he was very tired so he went to lie down. evening       knees           marble           threw         growing         fight 
in the evening he came back. the iron men were growing up. some of the men had only their feet in the ground. some of them were in the ground up to their knees. some had only their heads out. they all tried to get out so they could kill jason. then jason did what medea told him he should do. he took a giants marble and threw it near the men. all the iron men wanted to get the marble. so they began to fight each other. as soon as one had his feet out of the ground he cut at the man next to him. so they killed each other. then jason took his sword and cut off all the heads that were out of the ground. so all the iron men were killed and the king was very angry. but medea and the people were glad. jason and the dragon. my father will not give it to you. he is always hungry and eats people if they go near him. i can not kill him but i can make him sleep. he is very fond of cake. became        climbed         angry 
so medea made the cakes and jason took them and threw them to the dragon. the dragon ate them all and went to sleep. then jason climbed over the dragon and took the nail out of the tree. medea went with him and became his wife. oh how angry the king was he had lost the golden fleece and the brass bulls and the dragons teeth. and now his daughter was gone. through       nine            stones 
he sent his men in ships to take jason but they could not get him. jasons father was there. he was a very old man. jason wanted his father to be king so he asked medea to make the old man young. then medea took her carriage and flew through the air. she did not come back for nine days. she picked flowers from the hills. she found all kinds of stones too. stick         died            woke 
when she went home she put all these things into a pot and cooked them. then she put a stick into the pot and leaves grew on it. his white hair turned black and teeth grew in his mouth. when he woke up he looked and felt like a young man. he lived many years and when he died jason was king. now it so happened that on one occasion the princesss golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it but on to the ground beyond and rolled straight into the water. the kings daughter followed it with her eyes but it vanished and the well was deep so deep that the bottom could not be seen. on this she began to cry and cried louder and louder and could not be comforted. she did not listen to it but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog who was forced to go back into his well again. and because i cried so the frog brought it out again for me and because he so insisted i promised him he should be my companion but i never thought he would be able to come out of his water youngest princess open the door for me princess youngest princess but when he fell down he was no frog but a kings son with beautiful kind eyes. he by her fathers will was now her dear companion and husband. then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself and that tomorrow they would go together into his kingdom. the carriage was to conduct the young king into his kingdom. faithful henry helped them both in and placed himself behind again and was full of joy because of this deliverance. what are you saying the mouse at once asked what name had been given to the third child. i have never seen it in print. you are a true friend you have devoured all when you were standing godmother. they were so poor however that they no longer had daily bread and did not know how to get food for her. each day she opened one of them until she had made the round of the twelve. she stayed there awhile and looked at everything in amazement then she touched the light a little with her finger and her finger became quite golden. immediately a great fear fell on her. she shut the door violently and ran away. she called the girl before her and asked to have the keys of heaven back. she wanted to cry out but she could bring forth no sound. into this she crept when night came and here she slept. here too she found a shelter from storm and rain but it was a miserable life and bitterly did she weep when she remembered how happy she had been in heaven and how the angels had played with her. roots and wild berries were her only food and for these she sought as far as she could go. in the autumn she picked up the fallen nuts and leaves and carried them into the hole. before long her clothes were all torn and one bit of them after another fell off her. as soon however as the sun shone warm again she went out and sat in front of the tree and her long hair covered her on all sides like a mantle. thus she sat year after year and felt the pain and the misery of the world. when he had at last forced his way through he saw a wonderfully beautiful maiden sitting under the tree and she sat there and was entirely covered with her golden hair down to her very feet. although she could not speak she was still so beautiful and charming that he began to love her with all his heart and it was not long before he married her. after a year or so had passed the queen brought a son into the world. she heard all this and could say nothing to the contrary but the king would not believe it for he loved her so much. thereupon a trial was held and as she could not answer and defend herself she was condemned to be burnt alive. he will never be good for anything as long as he lives. then the boy called to him for the third time and as that was also to no purpose he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs so that it fell down ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. thereupon he rang the bell went home and without saying a word went to bed and fell asleep. he has thrown my husband down the steps and made him break his leg. i am quite innocent. he was standing there by night like one who is intending to do some evil. go out of my sight. and as he was cold he lighted himself a fire but at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire he could not get warm. then he stirred the fire blew it and set them all round it to warm themselves. but they sat there and did not stir and the fire caught their clothes. the king had promised that he who would venture should have his daughter to wife and she was the most beautiful maiden the sun shone on. great treasures likewise lay in the castle which were guarded by evil spirits and these treasures would then be freed and would make a poor man rich enough. already many men had gone into the castle but as yet none had come out again. then the youth went next morning to the king and said if he were allowed he would watch three nights in the haunted castle. and as he thus sat his eyes would keep open no longer and he felt a desire to sleep. then he looked round and saw a great bed in the corner. when he was just going to shut his eyes however the bed began to move of its own accord and went over the whole of the castle. in the morning the king came and when he saw him lying there on the ground he thought the evil spirits had killed him and he was dead. then it was quiet for awhile and at length with a loud scream half a man came down the chimney and fell before him. he lay down and quietly fell asleep. next morning the king came to inquire after him. he felt his face but it was cold as ice. after a short time the dead man became warm too and began to move. then came the six men and carried him away again. he was old however and had a long white beard. the old man placed himself near and wanted to look on and his white beard hung down. the youth drew out the axe and let him go. ah one day she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. truly men are like that. but who should come in but the wolf they were terrified and wanted to hide themselves. but the wolf found them all and used no great ceremony one after the other he swallowed them down his throat. when the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself off laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside and began to sleep. soon afterwards the old goat came home again from the forest. ah what a sight she saw there she sought her children but they were nowhere to be found. she called them one after another by name but no one answered. then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children. at length in her grief she went out and the youngest kid ran with her. what rejoicing there was they embraced their dear mother and jumped like a sailor at his wedding. when the wolf at length had had his sleep out he got on his legs and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty he wanted to go to a well to drink. but when he began to walk and move about the stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. he is still of tender age and cannot always know how to guide himself. i should have no rest day or night until i had seen it with my own eyes. i will give my life to win her. then they sailed across the sea and sailed on until they came to the town wherein dwelt the princess of the golden dwelling. faithful john bade the king stay behind on the ship and wait for him. and when she was just turning round to carry away the sparkling water she saw the stranger and asked who he was. the things i have here are not to be compared with those my master has in his ship. then she got into the ship and the king led her within. many hours went by whilst she was seeing everything and in her delight she did not observe that the ship was sailing away. after she had looked at the last she thanked the merchant and wanted to go home but when she came to the side of the ship she saw that it was on the deep sea far from land and hurrying onwards with all sail set. on this he stopped playing and listened to what they were saying to each other for that he well understood. but who knows that the young king went towards it and was about to take hold of it but faithful john pushed him away seized it with gloves on carried it quickly to the fire and burnt it. then the king was full of joy and when he saw the queen coming he hid faithful john and the two children in a great cupboard. then they dwelt together in much happiness until their death. dont you know better than that he still waited a long while until evening came on and he was forced to go home. but no one would come and pay it. he was led before the king who sat there with his daughter and asked him what injury he had suffered. after three days had passed according to the kings command the peasant went before the king. afterwards he went to an inn and counted out his money. it was not long before a fox came creeping through the trees towards him. the musician tied a long string round the little hares neck the other end of which he fastened to the tree. full of anger and rage he hurried after the musician and wanted to tear him to pieces. and as he thus stood the wolf the fox and the hare came up and he saw well that they had some evil design. the musician however played once more to the man out of gratitude and then went onwards. they each kept watch in turn and sat on the highest oak and looked towards the tower. they lived together ten years in the little hut and the time did not appear long to them. the little daughter which their mother the queen had given birth to was now grown up she was good of heart and fair of face and had a golden star on her forehead. she walked the whole day and in the evening she came to the bewitched hut. then they were all rejoiced and fell on her neck and kissed and loved her with all their hearts. she wished to give her brothers pleasure and plucked the twelve flowers and thought she would present each brother with one while at dinner. why didst thou not leave the twelve white flowers growing then the king came by and saw the beautiful kings daughter with the golden star on her brow and was so charmed with her beauty that he called to ask her if she would be his wife. she made no answer but nodded a little with her head. so he climbed up the tree himself carried her down placed her on his horse and bore her home. and now as she dared to open her mouth and speak she told the king why she had been dumb and had never laughed. as they were thin people who did not take up much room the cock let them both get in but they had to promise him and his little hen not to step on their feet. late in the evening they came to an inn and as they did not like to go further by night and as the duck also was not strong on her feet and fell from one side to the other they went in. now he was thoroughly angry and suspected the guests who had come so late the night before and when he went and looked about for them they were gone. may heaven pity us. if our mother only knew the next day when they awoke the sun was already high in the sky and shone down hot into the tree. with this she tied the little beast and led it on and she walked deeper and deeper into the forest. and if only the brother had had his human form it would have been a delightful life. for some time they were alone like this in the wilderness. but it happened that the king of the country held a great hunt in the forest. the king and the huntsmen saw the pretty creature and started after him but they could not catch him and when they thought that they surely had him away he sprang through the bushes and could not be seen. ho the huntsman took notice of it all and went to the king and told him what he had seen and heard. now when she heard that they were so happy and so well off envy and hatred rose in her heart and left her no peace and she thought of nothing but how she could bring them again to misfortune. she gave her too the shape and the look of the queen only she could not make good the lost eye. but in order that the king might not see it she was to lie on the side on which she had no eye. in the evening when he came home and heard that he had a son he was heartily glad and was going to the bed of his dear wife to see how she was. but at midnight when all slept the nurse who was sitting in the nursery by the cradle and who was the only person awake saw the door open and the true queen walk in. then she went quite silently out of the door again. what is this the king dared not speak to her but on the next night he watched again. then she told the king the evil deed which the wicked witch and her daughter had been guilty of towards her. the king ordered both to be led before the judge and judgment was delivered against them. at length the woman hoped that god was about to grant her desire. these people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs. it was however surrounded by a high wall and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress who had great power and was dreaded by all the world. if he was to have any rest her husband must once more descend into the garden. when she was twelve years old the enchantress shut her into a tower which lay in a forest and had neither stairs nor door but quite at the top was a little window. after a year or two it came to pass that the kings son rode through the forest and went by the tower. then he heard a song which was so charming that he stood still and listened. the kings son wanted to climb up to her and looked for the door of the tower but none was to be found. he rode home but the singing had so deeply touched his heart that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it. he led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received and they lived for a long time afterwards happy and contented. the girls were acquainted with each other and went out walking together and afterwards came to the woman in her house. she informed her father how it had turned out. the next morning when the two girls got up there stood before the mans daughter milk for her to wash in and wine for her to drink but before the womans daughter stood water to wash herself with and water for drinking. on the second morning stood water for washing and water for drinking before the mans daughter as well as before the womans daughter. and on the third morning stood water for washing and water for drinking before the mans daughter and milk for washing and wine for drinking before the womans daughter and so it continued. the ground is frozen and besides the snow has covered everything. and why am i to go in this paper frock far and wide there was nothing but snow and not a green blade to be seen. when she got into the wood she saw a small house out of which peeped three dwarfs. in her joy she hastily gathered her basket full thanked the little men shook hands with each of them and ran home to take her stepmother what she had longed for so much. thereupon she related what had happened to her in the wood but with every word she spoke gold pieces fell from her mouth until very soon the whole room was covered with them. the girl went into the forest and straight up to the little house. and when she opened her mouth and was about to tell her mother what had happened to her in the wood with every word she said a toad sprang out of her mouth so that every one was seized with horror of her. then the stepmother was still more enraged and thought of nothing but how to do every possible injury to the mans daughter whose beauty however grew daily greater. once however when the king had gone out and no one else was present the wicked woman seized the queen by the head and her daughter seized her by the feet and they lifted her out of the bed and threw her out of the window into the stream which flowed by. then the ugly daughter laid herself in the bed and the old woman covered her up over her head. at last the mother was once so overcome with anger and impatience that she beat her on which the girl began to weep loudly. now at this very moment the queen drove by and when she heard the weeping she stopped her carriage went into the house and asked the mother why she was beating her daughter so that the cries could be heard out on the road let me have your daughter with me in the palace. when they had arrived at the palace she led her up into three rooms which were filled from the bottom to the top with the finest flax. when therefore she was alone she began to weep and sat thus for three days without moving a finger. when the first room was empty she went to the second and at last to the third and that too was quickly cleared. the boy was called hansel and the girl grethel. the two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger and had heard what their stepmother had said to their father. hansel stooped and put as many of them in the little pocket of his coat as he could possibly get in. then they all set out together on the way to the forest. when they had walked a short time hansel stood still and peeped back at the house and did so again and again. it was not however the axe it was a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. when at last they awoke it was already dark night. they walked the whole night long and by break of day came once more to their fathers house. the children were however still awake and had heard the conversation. their bit of bread was given to them but it was still smaller than the time before. the woman led the children still deeper into the forest where they had never in their lives been before. then they fell asleep and evening came and went but no one came to the poor children. they walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening but they did not get out of the forest and were very hungry for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries which grew on the ground. and as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep. and when it had finished its song it spread its wings and flew away before them and they followed it until they reached a little house on the roof of which it alighted and when they came quite up to little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes but that the windows were of clear sugar. hansel and grethel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. do come in and stay with me. afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen and hansel and grethel lay down in them and thought they were in heaven. when a child fell into her power she killed it cooked and ate it and that was a feast day with her. he might scream as he liked that was of no use. when four weeks had gone by and hansel still continued thin she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. oh then they began to run rushed into the parlour and threw themselves into their fathers arms. the man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest the woman however was dead. then all anxiety was at an end and they lived together in perfect happiness. when the king heard that he owed the victory to him alone he raised him above all the others gave him great treasures and made him the first in the kingdom. the king had a daughter who was very beautiful but she was also very strange. after a time a second snake crept out of the hole and when it saw the other lying dead and cut in pieces it went back but soon came again with three green leaves in its mouth. then it took the three pieces of the snake laid them together as they ought to go and placed one of the leaves on each wound. the leaves were left lying on the ground and a desire came into the mind of the unhappy man who had been watching all this to know if the wondrous power of the leaves which had brought the snake to life again could not likewise be of service to a human being. so he picked up the leaves and laid one of them on the mouth of his dead wife and the two others on her eyes. the king came down himself and opened the door and there he found both strong and well and rejoiced with them that now all sorrow was over. he was astonished when he saw them come alone and asked what had happened to them. nothing was hidden from him and it seemed as if news of the most secret things was brought to him through the air. but he had a strange custom every day after dinner when the table was cleared and no one else was present a trusty servant had to bring him one more dish. it was covered however and even the servant did not know what was in it neither did anyone know for the king never took off the cover to eat of it until he was quite alone. this had gone on for a long time when one day the servant who took away the dish was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help carrying the dish into his room. when he had carefully locked the door he lifted up the cover and saw a white snake lying on the dish. no sooner had it touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices outside his window. eating the snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals. now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most beautiful ring and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty servant who was allowed to go everywhere. in his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought how to help himself out of his trouble. the servant stood by and listened. the servant refused everything and only asked for a horse and some money for traveling as he had a mind to see the world and go about a little. he stood on the shore and considered what he should do when suddenly he saw three fishes come swimming towards him and they were the very fishes whose lives he had saved. full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him the promised reward. presently the kings daughter herself came down into the garden and was amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him. but he heard a rustling in the branches and a golden apple fell into his hand. but when she had reached the middle and heard the water rushing beneath her she was after all afraid and stood still and ventured no farther. the straw however began to burn broke in two pieces and fell into the stream. it would have been all over with her likewise if by good fortune a tailor who was traveling in search of work had not sat down to rest by the brook. what good will it do you to kill me go back and call him. and behind the cottage there was a small yard with hens and ducks and a little garden with flowers and fruit. with that they ate something and went to bed. look you couldnt we be the king over all that land he did not wish to go but yet he went. there is only one emperor in the land. an emperor the flounder cannot make you go at once if he can make a king he can make an emperor. then they opened the doors to him which were of pure gold. go to him directly. and yet in the midst of the sky there was still a small bit of blue though on every side it was as red as in a heavy storm. he pushed his way through the crowd. at length the sun began to rise and when the woman saw the red of dawn she sat up in bed and looked at it. before he went away he sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could take with him however he found nothing but an old cheese and that he put in his pocket. in front of the door he observed a bird which had caught itself in the thicket. it had to go into his pocket with the cheese. the road led him up a mountain and when he had reached the highest point of it there sat a powerful giant looking about him quite comfortably. i am just on my way thither and want to try my luck. nevertheless he wished to try him first and took a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out of it. then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high that the eye could scarcely follow it. the bird delighted with its liberty rose flew away and did not come back. but the little tailor was much too weak to hold the tree and when the giant let it go it sprang back again and the tailor was hurried into the air with it. i leapt over the tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket. the bed however was too big for the little tailor he did not lie down in it but crept into a corner. the giants were terrified they were afraid that he would strike them all dead and ran away in a great hurry. the little tailor went onwards always following his own pointed nose. after he had walked for a long time he came to the courtyard of a royal palace and as he felt weary he lay down on the grass and fell asleep. the counsel pleased the king and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer him military service when he awoke. the soldiers however were set against the little tailor and wished him a thousand miles away. he thought about it for a long time and at last found good counsel. he sent to the little tailor and caused him to be informed that as he was such a great warrior he had one request to make to him. after a while he perceived both giants. the little tailor began his game again picked out the biggest stone and threw it with all his might on the breast of the first giant. then the little tailor leapt down. he had to seek long. the king still would not give him the promised reward and made a third demand. the boar ran in after him but the tailor ran round outside and shut the door behind it and then the raging beast which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window was caught. the little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes. the hero however went to the king who was now whether he liked it or not obliged to keep his promise and gave him his daughter and the half of his kingdom. at night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time and when she thought that he had fallen asleep she got up opened the door and then lay down again. so the little tailor was a king and remained one to the end of his life. when winter came the snow spread a white sheet over the grave and when the spring sun had drawn it off again the man had taken another wife. and as on that account she always looked dusty and dirty they called her cinderella. then he broke off the branch and took it with him. and it grew however and became a handsome tree. thrice a day cinderella went and sat beneath it and wept and prayed and a little white bird always came on the tree and if cinderella expressed a wish the bird threw down to her what she had wished for. it happened however that the king appointed a festival which was to last three days and to which all the beautiful young girls in the country were invited in order that his son might choose himself a bride. hardly had one hour passed before they had finished and all flew out again. then the girl took the dish to her stepmother and was glad and believed that now she would be allowed to go with them to the festival. then the maiden carried the dishes to the stepmother and was delighted and believed that she might now go with them to the festival. she put on the dress with all speed and went to the festival. the prince went to meet her took her by the hand and danced with her. and when cinderella appeared at the festival in this dress every one was astonished at her beauty. the kings son had waited until she came and instantly took her by the hand and danced with no one but her. but she sprang away from him and into the garden behind the house. and when she went to the festival in the dress no one knew how to speak for astonishment. the kings son picked it up and it was small and dainty and all golden. the eldest went with the shoe into her room and wanted to try it on and her mother stood by. then he took her on his his horse as his bride and rode away with her. he turned his horse round and took the false bride home again and said she was not the true one and that the other sister was to put the shoe on. then this one went into her chamber and got her toes safely into the shoe but her heel was too large. then he turned his horse and took the false bride home again. she first washed her hands and face clean and then went and bowed down before the kings son who gave her the golden shoe. when the wedding with the kings son had to be celebrated the two false sisters came and wanted to get into favour with cinderella and share her good fortune. then he saw a girl who was going towards a small house and when he came nearer he saw that the maiden was young and beautiful. they slept quietly until early morning. the servant ran after his master and told him what had happened but would not leave his saddle behind him and ran back to fetch it. and now they journeyed onwards into the forest the whole day but could not get out of it. the servant gave the raven to the innkeeper to make ready for supper. before they set about this work they sat down to supper and the innkeeper and the witch sat down with them and together they ate a dish of soup in which was cut up the flesh of the raven. but the kings son said she might keep everything he would have none of it and rode onwards with his servant. now the master believed himself safe for the third night and lay down in his own bed. and when she thought that he was asleep and dreaming she spoke to him and hoped that he would answer in his sleep as many do but he was awake and understood and heard everything quite well. the birds work was to fly every day into the forest and bring back wood. the mouse had to carry water light the fire and lay the table but the sausage had to cook. he who is too well off is always longing for something new. the other bird however called it a poor simpleton for his hard work but said that the two at home had good times. for when the mouse had made her fire and carried her water she went into her little room to rest until they called her to lay the table. when the bird came home and laid his burden down they sat down to dinner and after they had had their meal they slept their fill till next morning and that was a splendid life. and though the mouse and the sausage also begged most earnestly the bird would have his way and said it must be tried. they cast lots about it and the lot fell on the sausage who was to carry wood the mouse became cook and the bird was to fetch water. what happened the little sausage went out towards the wood the little bird lighted the fire the mouse stayed by the pot and waited alone until little sausage came home and brought wood for next day. the bird sadly took up the wood flew home and related what he had seen and heard. they were much troubled but agreed to do their best and remain together. when the bird came to carry up the dinner no cook was there. in its distress the bird threw the wood here and there called and searched but no cook was to be found she lost her senses and when she awoke and came to herself again she was in a lovely meadow where the sun was shining and many thousands of flowers were growing. take me out shake me at last she came to a little house out of which an old woman peeped but she had such large teeth that the girl was frightened and was about to run away. stay with me if you will do all the work in the house properly you shall be the better for it. as the old woman spoke so kindly to her the girl took courage and agreed to enter her service. so she had a pleasant life with her never an angry word and boiled or roast meat every day. the door was opened and just as the maiden was standing beneath the doorway a heavy shower of golden rain fell and all the gold remained sticking to her so that she was completely covered over with it. thereupon the door closed and the maiden found herself up above upon the earth not far from her mothers house. the girl told all that had happened to her and as soon as the mother heard how she had come by so much wealth she was very anxious to obtain the same good luck for the ugly and lazy daughter. she came like the other to the beautiful meadow and walked along the very same path. take me out shake me but on the second day she began to be lazy and on the third day still more so and then she would not get up in the morning at all. the lazy girl was willing enough to go and thought that now the golden rain would come. at length his wife again gave him hope of a child and when it came into the world it was a girl. the other six went with him and as each of them wanted to be first to fill it the jug fell into the well. there they stood and did not know what to do and none of them dared to go home. the parents could not recall the curse and however sad they were at the loss of their seven sons they still to some extent comforted themselves with their dear little daughter who soon grew strong and every day became more beautiful. the parents now dared keep the secret no longer but said that what had befallen her brothers was the will of heaven and that her birth had only been the innocent cause. but the maiden took it to heart daily and thought she must deliver her brothers. she had no rest or peace until she set out secretly and went forth into the wide world to trace out her brothers and set them free let it cost what it might. and now she went continually onwards far far to the very end of the world. then she came to the sun but it was too hot and terrible and devoured little children. what was she now to do she wished to rescue her brothers and had no key to the glass mountain. the good sister took a knife cut off one of her little fingers put it in the door and succeeded in opening it. who has drunk out of my little glass and they embraced and kissed each other and went joyfully home. and whenever she had picked one she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on and ran after it and so got deeper and deeper into the wood. meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmothers house and knocked at the door. then he put on her clothes dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed and drew the curtains. there lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face and looking very strange. then all three were delighted. but the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts. but now good advice is scarce. the donkey and the hound laid themselves down under a large tree the cat and the cock settled themselves in the branches but the cock flew right to the top where he was most safe. the donkey as the biggest went to the window and looked in. then the animals took counsel together how they should manage to drive away the robbers and at last they thought of a plan. the four companions now sat down at the table well content with what was left and ate as if they were going to fast for a month. and the mouth of him who last told this story is still warm. at last the king gave notice that whosoever should capture or kill the wild boar should have his only daughter to wife. when the younger had gone a short way a little man stepped up to him. as he came out at the other side of the wood there stood at the entrance a house where people were making merry with wine and dancing. his elder brother had gone in here and thinking that after all the boar would not run away from him was going to drink until he felt brave. he buried him beneath the bridge took the boar and carried it to the king pretending that he had killed it whereupon he obtained the kings daughter in marriage. but as nothing remains hidden from god so this black deed also was to come to light. years afterwards a shepherd was driving his herd across the bridge and saw lying in the sand beneath a snowwhite little bone. the king understood it all and caused the ground below the bridge to be dug up and then the whole skeleton of the murdered man came to light. a millers boy who by good luck was standing there noticed it and pulled it out with a hook thinking that he had found a great treasure but when he opened it there lay a pretty boy inside quite fresh and lively. in the darkness he saw a small light he went towards it and reached a cottage. when he went in an old woman was sitting by the fire quite alone. soon afterwards the robbers came and angrily asked what strange boy was lying there then they let him lie quietly on the bench until the next morning and when he awoke they gave him the letter and showed him the right way. the king read the letter and saw quite well that it had been exchanged for the other. the road led him to a large town where the watchman by the gates asked him what his trade was and what he knew. no sooner had he entered than he noticed that the air was not pure. his grandmother scolded him. then the old woman took hold of a golden hair pulled it out and laid it down near her. then she pulled the second hair out. then she took hold of the third golden hair and pulled it out. at last he came to the town whose well was dry. the devil appeared quite early but he could not come near to her. the next morning the devil came again but she had wept on her hands and they were quite clean. then he had to give in and had lost all right over her. and now she went into the garden and the angel went with her. then she went to them and to still her hunger ate one with her mouth from the tree but no more. the gardener was watching but as the angel was standing by he was afraid and thought the maiden was a spirit and was silent neither did he dare to cry out or to speak to the spirit. and as it must have been an angel i was afraid and asked no questions and did not cry out. all three seated themselves beneath the tree and watched. when the king read the letter he was shocked and much troubled but he wrote in answer that they were to take great care of the queen and nurse her well until his arrival. the messenger went back with the letter but rested at the same place and again fell asleep. then came the devil once more and put a different letter in his pocket in which it was written that they were to put the queen and her child to death. the old mother was terribly shocked when she received the letter and could not believe it. but the old mother wept to think such innocent blood was to be shed and had a hind brought by night and cut out her tongue and eyes and kept them. at last the king came home again from the war and his first wish was to see his wife and the child. during the whole of this time he neither ate nor drank but god supported him. then he lay down to sleep and put a handkerchief over his face. the king in his sleep heard what passed and had pleasure in letting the handkerchief fall once more. i have learnt to say the prayer our father which art in heaven thou hast told me that my father was in heaven and was the good god and how can i know a wild man like this when he gets home he has the rope in his hand and there is no longer anything hanging to it. then hans goes to his mother. then grethel became angry tore herself loose and ran away and became the bride of hans. he went down again and as he knew what he had to do he did it thoroughly and brought a chest full of gold out with him. the howling of the wild dogs was henceforth heard no more they had disappeared and the country was freed from the trouble. after some time he took it into his head that he would travel to rome. he listened to them and when he became aware of what they were saying he grew very thoughtful and sad. then she ran out of the village and no one has seen her since. the lord had commanded him to let no one in during his absence so peter stood by the door and kept watch. before long some one knocked. peter asked who was there and what he wanted thou wilt not get into heaven. only let me in and i will do all the rough work. it was however the seat on which the lord sat when he was at home and from which he could see everything which happened on earth. the tailor stood still and looked at the seat for a long time for it pleased him better than all else. at last he could master his curiosity no longer and climbed up and seated himself in the chair. as however he could not bring the stool back again he slipped quietly out of the chair seated himself in his place behind the door and behaved as if he had never stirred from the spot. he asked saint peter what had become of the stool but he did not know. then he asked if he had let anyone come in. henceforth thou canst stay no longer in heaven but must go outside the door again. then go where thou wilt. but as the goat supported the whole of them with her milk she was obliged to have good food and to be taken every day to pasture. the sons therefore did this in turn. next day it was the turn of the second son who looked out for a place in the fence of the garden where nothing but good herbs grew and the goat cleared them all off. the old tailor was now alone with his goat. when the tailor was thus left quite alone in his house he fell into great grief and would gladly have had his sons back again but no one knew whither they were gone. it came to pass that on his way home he came one evening to an inn which was filled with guests. they bade him welcome and invited him to sit and eat with them for otherwise he would have difficulty in getting anything. and what surprised them the most was that when a dish became empty a full one instantly took its place of its own accord. after dinner the guest asked what he owed. he felt in his pocket but his gold was just at an end. as soon as they were assembled the miller bade them make way spread out his cloth and brought the ass into the room. he laid his sack on the table before him and began to talk of all the wonderful things which he had seen in the world. the tailor rejoiced when he saw him once more and asked him likewise what he had learned in foreign parts. thats worth thy trouble indeed i can see in thy face that thou also wouldst like to be there. what however has become of the goat who was to blame for the tailor driving out his three sons that i will tell thee. when the fox came home he was met by two great eyes shining out of the darkness and was terrified and ran away. there the thieves at length found him and lifted him up. the thieves took flight and ran as if the wild huntsman were behind them but as the maid could not see anything she went to strike a light. but he had other things to go through. when he had eaten his fill he wanted to go out again but he had become so big that he could not go out by the same way. after that he raised his arm and struck the wolf such a blow on his head that he fell down dead and then they got knives and scissors and cut his body open and drew the little fellow forth. they gave him to eat and to drink and had some new clothes made for him for his own had been spoiled on his journey. he stretched himself out under the bench did not move a limb and behaved as if he were stone dead. mrs. fox went up to her room shut herself in and her maid miss cat sat by the fire and did the cooking. he had two tails but he did not fare better than the first. after this still more came each with one tail more than the other but they were all turned away until at last one came who had nine tails like old mr. fox. if youre in want of a husband now then will it please you to step below at length came a young fox. in the morning after he had said his prayers and was just going to sit down to work the two shoes stood quite finished on his table. they did not stop until all was done and stood finished on the table and they ran quickly away. they run about so and have nothing on and must be cold. at last they danced out of doors. everything there was small but more elegant and beautiful than can be described. at last she set out on her way home. then first they filled her pockets quite full of money and after that they led her out of the mountain again. when she got home she wanted to begin her work and took the broom which was still standing in the corner in her hand and began to sweep. then some strangers came out of the house who asked her who she was and what business she had there in her trouble she went to her neighbour and asked her advice. the woman did everything that her neighbour bade her. the maiden however did not like him quite so much as a girl should like the man to whom she is engaged and had no confidence in him. whenever she saw or thought of him she felt a secret horror. she went inside it but no one was within and the most absolute stillness reigned. at last she came to the the cellar and there sat an extremely aged woman whose head shook constantly. thou art in a murderers den. they dragged with them another young girl. one of them noticed a gold ring on the little finger of the murdered girl and as it would not come off at once he took an axe and cut the finger off but it sprang up in the air away over the cask and fell straight into the brides bosom. the robber took a candle and wanted to look for it but could not find it. but god helped her and she got safely over. they walked the whole night until in the morning they arrived at the mill and then the maiden told her father everything exactly as it had happened. when the day came when the wedding was to be celebrated the bridegroom appeared and the miller had invited all his relations and friends. the bride sat still and said nothing. then i went through all the rooms and they were all empty and there was something so horrible about them at last i went down into the cellar and there sat a very very old woman whose head shook i asked her does my bridegroom live in this house the robber who had during this story become as pale as ashes leapt up and wanted to escape but the guests held him fast and delivered him over to justice. the hen seated herself in it with the cock and they drove away together. take great care not to dirty my little red wheels. he wanted to rest and sat down in the chair and then the pin pricked him. he knew not what to do and in his perplexity he lay down and fell asleep. he turned therefore away from the lord and went farther. i make thee a celebrated physician. when thou art called to a patient i will always appear to thee. when the physician came to the sick girls bed he saw death by her feet. he raised up the sick girl and placed her head where her feet had lain. immediately the physician fell on the ground and now he himself was in the hands of death. he rode about in the air on the steam for a while until at length he sank down to the ground again. now the little tailor was outside in the wide world and he travelled about and went to a master in his craft but the food was not good enough for him. at last however she caught him and drove him out of the house. the little tailor journeyed on and came to a great forest and there he fell in with a band of robbers who had a design to steal the kings treasure. then he looked at the doors above and below to see if there was any crack in them. the maids however could not endure him for he saw all they did secretly without their seeing him and he told their master and mistress what they had taken off the plates and carried away out of the cellar for themselves. down below however it pleased him ill for it was quite dark neither was any candle burning. next morning the cow was killed. but his liberty did not last long. in the open country he met with a fox who snapped him up in a fit of absence. when the father once more saw his dear son he willingly gave the fox all the fowls which he had. no one knew whither he carried them for they were never seen more. he begged for a little food and when the eldest daughter came out and was just reaching him a piece of bread he did but touch her and she was forced to jump into his basket. when he was gone she went all round the house from the bottom to the top and examined everything. at length she came to the forbidden door she wished to pass it by but curiosity let her have no rest. but what did she see when she went in she was so terribly alarmed that the egg which she held in her hand fell into the basin. she got it out and washed the blood off but in vain it appeared again in a moment. it was not long before the man came back from his journey and the first things which he asked for were the key and the egg. then he threw her into the basin with the rest. then the second daughter brought him a piece of bread he caught her like the first by simply touching her and carried her away. she did not fare better than her sister. when he had given her the keys and the egg and had left her she first put the egg away with great care and then she examined the house and at last went into the forbidden room. alas what did she behold but she began to gather their limbs together and put them in order head body arms and legs. they locked all the doors of the house that no one might escape set fire to it and the wizard and all his crew had to burn. they had however no children though they wished for them very much and the woman prayed for them day and night but still they had none. by the second wife he had a daughter but the first wifes child was a little son and he was as red as blood and as white as snow. she shut the lid down and his head flew off and fell among the red apples. and she went merrily into the house and sat down to dinner and ate. he stood up but as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his slippers. let me too hear that. he has not a tooth left in his mouth and not a thief is afraid of him now he may be off. he had a good friend the wolf and he crept out in the evening into the forest to him and complained of the fate that awaited him. i have thought of something. tomorrow early in the morning your master is going with his wife to make hay and they will take their little child with them for no one will be left behind in the house. then i will come out of the wood and carry off the child. you must rush swiftly after me as if you would seize it again from me. soon afterwards the wolf visited him and was pleased that everything had succeeded so well. and when the poor beast hopped on its three legs they could only think every time that it was picking up a stone to throw at them. the dog and the cat when they came up wondered that there was no one to be seen. the wild boar however had not been able to hide himself altogether and one of his ears was still to be seen. whilst the cat was looking carefully about the boar moved his ear the cat who thought it was a mouse moving there jumped upon it and bit it hard. when evening drew near he stopped and looked around him and then he saw that he had lost his way. he sought a way out but could find none. she received the king as if she had been expecting him and he saw that she was very beautiful but still she did not please him and he could not look at her without secret horror. after he had taken the maiden up on his horse the old woman showed him the way and the king reached his royal palace again where the wedding was celebrated. the king had already been married once and had by his first wife seven children six boys and a girl whom he loved better than anything else in the world. as he now feared that the stepmother might not treat them well and even do them some injury he took them to a lonely castle which stood in the midst of a forest. the king however went so frequently away to his dear children that the queen observed his absence she was curious and wanted to know what he did when he was quite alone in the forest. she gave a great deal of money to his servants and they betrayed the secret to her and told her likewise of the ball which alone could point out the way. the children who saw from a distance that some one was approaching thought that their dear father was coming to them and full of joy ran to meet him. next day the king went to visit his children but he found no one but the little girl. but she was afraid of her stepmother and entreated the king to let her stay just this one night more in the forest castle. just before sunset however she heard a rustling and saw six swans come flying in at the window. then the maiden looked at them and recognized her brothers was glad and crept forth from beneath the bed. the maiden however firmly resolved to deliver her brothers even if it should cost her her life. she left the hut went into the midst of the forest seated herself on a tree and there passed the night. she could not speak to any one and she had no inclination to laugh she sat there and looked at nothing but her work. when she had already spent a long time there it came to pass that the king of the country was hunting in the forest and his huntsmen came to the tree on which the maiden was sitting. as they pressed her further with questions she threw her golden necklace down to them and thought to content them thus. the huntsmen however did not let themselves be turned aside by that but climbed the tree and fetched the maiden down and led her before the king. he put his mantle on her took her before him on his horse and carried her to his castle. then he caused her to be dressed in rich garments and she shone in her beauty like bright daylight but no word could be drawn from her. the king would not believe it and would not suffer any one to do her any injury. then she saw that her deliverance was near and her heart leapt with joy. then to the great joy of the king they were brought thither and as a punishment the wicked stepmother was bound to the stake and burnt to ashes. but the king and the queen with their six brothers lived many years in happiness and peace. there were thirteen of them in his kingdom but as he had only twelve golden plates for them to eat out of one of them had to be left at home. it happened that on the very day when she was fifteen years old the king and queen were not at home and the maiden was left in the palace quite alone. and this sleep extended over the whole palace the king and queen who had just come home and had entered the great hall began to go to sleep and the whole of the court with them. and the wind fell and on the trees before the castle not a leaf moved again. and when he entered the house the flies were asleep upon the wall the cook in the kitchen was still holding out his hand to seize the boy and the maid was sitting by the black hen which she was going to pluck. he went on farther and in the great hall he saw the whole of the court lying asleep and up by the throne lay the king and queen. there she lay so beautiful that he could not turn his eyes away and he stooped down and gave her a kiss. then they went down together and the king awoke and the queen and the whole court and looked at each other in great astonishment. he followed the sound and at last came to a high tree and at the top of this a little child was sitting for the mother had fallen asleep under the tree with the child and a bird of prey had seen it in her arms had flown down snatched it away and set it on the high tree. but when she came in and went to the beds both the children were gone. the children however saw them coming from a distance. then the children went home together and were heartily delighted and if they are not dead they are living still. she began to weep and did now know what to do for fear. it happened that the wedding of the kings eldest son was to be celebrated so the poor woman went up and placed herself by the door of the hall to look on. all at once the kings son entered clothed in velvet and silk with gold chains about his neck. i wish you and i had been there too. and whilst she was sewing and looking out of the window at the snow she pricked her finger with the needle and three drops of blood fell upon the snow. and when the child was born the queen died. after a year had passed the king took to himself another wife. but snowwhite was growing up and grew more and more beautiful and when she was seven years old she was as beautiful as the day and more beautiful than the queen herself. the cook had to salt this and the wicked queen ate it and thought she had eaten the heart of snowwhite. but now the poor child was all alone in the great forest and so terrified that she looked at every leaf of every tree and did not know what to do. she ran as long as her feet would go until it was almost evening then she saw a little cottage and went into it to rest herself. then as she was so tired she laid herself down on one of the little beds but none of them suited her one was too long another too short but at last she found that the seventh one was right and so she remained in it said a prayer and went to sleep. and he called the others who came running up and they cried out with astonishment and brought their seven little candles and let the light fall on little snowwhite. and the seventh dwarf slept with his companions one hour with each and so got through the night. when it was morning little snowwhite awoke and was frightened when she saw the seven dwarfs. but they were friendly and asked her what her name was. then she told them that her stepmother had wished to have her killed but that the huntsman had spared her life and that she had run for the whole day until at last she had found their dwelling. not long afterwards in the evening the seven dwarfs came home but how shocked they were when they saw their dear little snowwhite lying on the ground and that she neither stirred nor moved and seemed to be dead. but fortunately it was almost evening when the seven dwarfs came home. scarcely had they taken it out when snowwhite came to herself and told them what had happened. then they warned her once more to be upon her guard and to open the door to no one. outside it looked pretty white with a red cheek so that everyone who saw it longed for it but whoever ate a piece of it must surely die. she knocked at the door. but hardly had she a bit of it in her mouth than she fell down dead. the dwarfs when they came home in the evening found snowwhite lying upon the ground she breathed no longer and was dead. then they were going to bury her but she still looked as if she were living and still had her pretty red cheeks. then they put the coffin out upon the mountain and one of them always stayed by it and watched it. and birds came too and wept for snowwhite first an owl then a raven and last a dove. it happened however that a kings son came into the forest and went to the dwarfs house to spend the night. he saw the coffin on the mountain and the beautiful snowwhite within it and read what was written upon it in golden letters. and now the kings son had it carried away by his servants on their shoulders. and before long she opened her eyes lifted up the lid of the coffin sat up and was once more alive. at first she would not go to the wedding at all but she had no peace and must go to see the young queen. and when she went in she knew snowwhite and she stood still with rage and fear and could not stir. one day they arrived in a great forest and in the midst of it was a hill and when they came nearer they saw that the hill was all silver. after they had walked for two days longer without stopping they came to a hill which was all gold. they ate and drank together and enjoyed themselves heartily. the youth set still more men against them and in order to be done the sooner he turned his hat twice round on his head and heavy guns began to play and the kings men were beaten and put to flight. they obeyed and the false wife sent still more men after him who were to drive him quite out of the country. then he would have been ruined if he had not had the little hat. but his hands were scarcely at liberty before he turned it twice. immediately the cannon began to thunder and struck down everything and the kings daughter herself was forced to come and beg for mercy. when she knew the secret she waited until he was asleep and then she took the hat away from him and had it thrown out into the street. but the horn still remained to him and in great anger he blew it with all his strength. and had he not put down the horn and had blown just a little longer everything would have been in ruins and not one stone would have been left standing on another. so there sat the poor millers daughter and for the life of her could not tell what to do she had no idea how straw could be spun into gold and she grew more and more miserable until at last she began to weep. the little man took the ring again began to turn the wheel and by morning had spun all the straw into glittering gold. and when the king came in the morning and found all as he had wished he took her in marriage and the pretty millers daughter became a queen. ha in the night the old woman came creeping in she held an axe in her right hand and felt with her left to see if anyone was lying at the outside and then she grasped the axe with both hands and cut her own childs head off. then she hurried away with her lover. when the old witch got up next morning she called her daughter and wanted to give her the apron but she did not come. she went into the kitchen but found no one. she went into the room to the bed. what did she see there from that time forth strange things happened in the shepherds house. swiftly he sprang towards it and threw a white cloth over it. when the faithful maiden heard of this she grew so sad that she thought her heart would break and she would not go thither but the other girls came and took her. when it came to her turn to sing she stepped back until at last she was the only one left and then she could not refuse. when the apples were getting ripe they were counted but on the very next morning one was missing. this was told to the king and he ordered that a watch should be kept every night beneath the tree. the king had three sons the eldest of whom he sent as soon as night came on into the garden but when midnight came he could not keep himself from sleeping and next morning again an apple was gone. now it came to the turn of the third son to watch and he was quite ready but the king had not much trust in him and thought that he would be of less use even than his brothers but at last he let him go. the youth lay down beneath the tree but kept awake and did not let sleep master him. the bird alighted on the tree and had just plucked off an apple when the youth shot an arrow at him. the youth picked it up and the next morning took it to the king and told him what he had seen in the night. the king called his council together and everyone declared that a feather like this was worth more than the whole kingdom. and in return i will give you some good counsel. but he missed the fox who stretched out his tail and ran quickly into the wood. when some time had passed and the eldest son for month after month did not come back home the second set out wishing to find the golden bird. the fox met him as he had met the eldest and gave him the good advice of which he took no heed. he could not resist but went inside and lived only for pleasure. again some time passed and then the kings youngest son wanted to set off and try his luck but his father would not allow it. again the fox was sitting outside the wood and begged for his life and offered his good advice. when they came to the village the youth got off he followed the good advice and without looking round turned into the little inn where he spent the night quietly. go through the midst of them straight into the castle and go through all the rooms till at last you will come to a chamber where a golden bird is hanging in a wooden cage. when he came to the castle he found everything as the fox had said. the kings son went into the chamber where the golden bird was shut up in a wooden cage whilst a golden one stood hard by and the three golden apples lay about the room. but at the same moment the bird uttered a shrill cry. the soldiers awoke rushed in and took him off to prison. the kings son set off but he sighed and was sorrowful for how was he to find the golden horse but all at once he saw his old friend the fox sitting on the road. however be of good courage. i will give you my help and tell you how to get to the golden horse. you must go straight on and you will come to a castle where in the stable stands the horse. when he reached the golden castle it was just as the fox had said. then he sprang out and gave her a kiss. the youth ran full of joy to the king and told him that the task was fulfilled and whether he liked it or not the king had to hold to his word and give him his daughter. so the two set forth together and it was not long before the trusty fox came up with them. mount it as soon as possible and offer your hand to all in farewell last of all to the beautiful maiden. when you come near to the castle where the golden bird is to be found let the maiden get down and i will take her into my care. be careful about two things. there was a great stir and noise and when he asked what was going on he was told that two men were going to be hanged. he inquired whether they could not be set free. but the two brothers threw him backwards into the well took the maiden the horse and the bird and went home to their father. but the youngest brother was not dead. by good fortune the well was dry and he fell upon soft moss without being hurt but he could not get out again. no one knew him but the bird began to sing the horse began to eat and the beautiful maiden left off weeping. the king commanded that all people who were in his castle should be brought before him and amongst them came the youth in his ragged clothes but the maiden knew him at once and fell upon his neck. the wicked brothers were seized and put to death but he was married to the beautiful maiden and declared heir to the king. but how did it fare with the poor fox so he did it and scarcely was it done when the fox was changed into a man and was no other than the brother of the beautiful princess who at last was freed from the magic charm which had been laid upon him. and now nothing more was wanting to their happiness as long as they lived. as he could stay no longer with him he went quite sadly away. then the dog seized it ran into a corner and devoured it. when the driver saw that he drew out his axe and wanted to hit the sparrow but the sparrow flew into the air and he hit his horse on the head and it fell down dead. the driver ran up to it and raised his axe to strike but the sparrow flew into the air and the blow struck the horse which fell. the driver in his rage struck at the sparrow without looking round and did not hit him but killed his third horse likewise. at length however he caught it with his hand. but the sparrow flew up and away. the dog upstairs is not fastened up it might get the sausage out of the pan. during this time the beer was still running out of the cask for kate had not turned the tap. and when the can was full and there was no other place for it it ran into the cellar and did not stop until the whole cask was empty. then catherine was angry and threw down the fifth and sixth as well and these were her last. do you think i will wait any longer for you she gave him the dry bread. at length as it grew dark they climbed into a tree and resolved to spend the night there. frederick got down on the other side and collected some stones together. then he climbed up again with them and wished to throw them at the thieves and kill them. early next morning when the two came down they found all their gold again and carried it home. and when they came to the ground catherine arose and stood up her full height. the two boys went backwards and forwards to the rich house and often got some of the scraps to eat. he picked up a small stone threw it at him and was lucky enough to hit him but one golden feather only fell down and the bird flew away. next morning however when he felt beneath his pillow and expected to bring out the piece of gold no more gold pieces were there than there had always been. and now the two children ran about the forest and sought the way home again but could not find it and only lost themselves more and more. but the little creatures played so merrily and were so pretty that the huntsmen could not find it in their hearts to kill them. at length who came then the innkeeper let them be taken to a place where a cow was just then lying on the grass that they might eat till they were satisfied. when the kings daughter got to the top of the hill it was not the dragon which stood there but the young huntsman who comforted her and said he would save her led her into the church and locked her in. then the dragon rushed upon the huntsman but he swung his sword until it sang through the air and struck off three of his heads. he carried her out and when she came to herself once more and opened her eyes he showed her the dragon all cut to pieces and told her that she was now delivered. and now the kings daughter the huntsman the lion the bear the wolf the fox and the hare were all sleeping a sound sleep. as soon as the hare was awake he roused the fox and the fox the wolf and the wolf the bear and the bear the lion. the lion put the huntsmans head on again and the hare placed the root in his mouth and immediately everything united together again and his heart beat and life came back. but at noon when he was going to eat something he saw that his head was turned backwards and could not understand it and asked the animals what had happened to him in his sleep. the huntsman however was sad at heart and travelled about the world and made his animals dance before people. it came to pass that precisely at the end of one year he came back to the same town where he had delivered the kings daughter from the dragon and this time the town was gaily hung with red cloth. but he sprang away have you have never seen one running as soon as the hare saw that the way was clear he ran into the palace and straight to the kings daughter sat down under her chair and scratched at her foot. but the hare did not let itself be turned from its purpose and scratched her for the third time. then she peeped down and knew the hare by its collar. then the fox took the dish waved away with his tail the flies which had settled on the meat and then carried it to his master. but he got up on his hind legs and gave them a few boxes on the ears right and left with his paws so that the whole watch broke up and then he went straight to the kings daughter placed himself behind her and growled a little. then the lion went to the royal apartment and knocked at the door with his tail. and he put each tongue in the mouth to which it belonged and it fitted exactly. he often went out hunting because it was a delight to him and the faithful animals had to accompany him. in the neighborhood however there was a forest of which it was reported that it was haunted and that whosoever did but enter it did not easily get out again. the young king however had a great inclination to hunt in it and let the old king have no peace until he allowed him to do so. then she was in the greatest concern about him. while he was sitting by the fire and his animals also were lying down beside him it seemed to him that he heard a human voice. he looked round but could perceived nothing. and when the witch was safe from the animals she leapt down and touched him also with a wand and changed him to stone. as however the young king did not come back at all the queens anguish and care grew constantly greater. and it so happened that at this very time the other brother who had turned to the east when they separated came into the kingdom. he had sought a situation and had found none and had then travelled about here and there and had made his animals dance. then it came into his mind that he would just go and look at the knife that they had thrust in the trunk of a tree at their parting that he might learn how his brother was. the young queen indeed thought that he was her husband and asked him why he had stayed away so long. then he set his foot on her and said old witch if thou dost not instantly confess where my brother is i will seize thee with both my hands and throw thee into the fire. then they seized the witch bound her and laid her on the fire and when she was burnt the forest opened of its own accord and was light and clear and the kings palace could be seen at about the distance of a three hours walk. he had not even so much as a cow and still less money to buy one and yet he and his wife did so wish to have one. and now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had so long wished and they were heartily glad but they had no food for it and could give it nothing to eat so it soon had to be killed. on the way he passed by a mill and there sat a raven with broken wings and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. as however the weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind he could go no farther and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. just as they were about to sit down and eat there was a knocking outside. and now the two sat down to the table together but the millers wife was frightened to death and went to bed and took all the keys with her. he was led forth and a priest was brought who was to say a mass for his soul. the parson went to the crowd and declared that the mass had been said. then they came and rolled the barrel towards the water. after that the peasants went home and as they were entering the village the small peasant also came quietly in driving a flock of sheep and looking quite contented. went the water he made a sound as if he were calling them and the whole crowd plunged in after him as one man. then the entire village was dead and the small peasant as sole heir became a rich man. there they saw a little grey man who was sitting at a table. they called him once twice but he did not hear at last they called him for the third time when he got up opened the locks and came out. the first was that in the forest beneath the moss lay the princesss pearls a thousand in number which must be picked up and if by sunset one single pearl was wanting he who had looked for them would be turned into stone. the eldest went thither and sought the whole day but when it came to an end he had only found one hundred and what was written on the table came to pass and he was changed into stone. at last the turn came to simpleton also who sought in the moss. it was however so hard to find the pearls and he got on so slowly that he seated himself on a stone and wept. and while he was thus sitting the king of the ants whose life he had once saved came with five thousand ants and before long the little creatures had got all the pearls together and laid them in a heap. when simpleton came to the lake the ducks which he had saved swam up to him dived down and brought the key out of the water. but the third task was the most difficult from amongst the three sleeping daughters of the king was the youngest and dearest to be sought out. then the enchantment was at an end everything was released from sleep and those who had been turned to stone received once more their natural forms. simpleton married the youngest and sweetest princess and after her fathers death became king and his two brothers received the two other sisters. the fat toad asked what he wanted then he thanked her and ascended again. the two others had however looked on their youngest brother as so stupid that they believed he would find and bring nothing at all. those of the two eldest again went east and west and simpletons feather flew straight up and fell down near the door into the earth. then he went down again to the fat toad and told her that he wanted the most beautiful ring. the two eldest laughed at simpleton for going to seek a golden ring. he again blew the three feathers into the air and they flew as before. so he kissed her and drove off quickly with the horses and took her to the king. his brothers came afterwards they had given themselves no trouble at all to seek beautiful girls but had brought with them the first peasant women they chanced to meet. then the two peasant women jumped and jumped through the ring but were so stout that they fell and their coarse arms and legs broke in two. and this was the little grey mans doing. after this the second son went into the forest and his mother gave him like the eldest a cake and a bottle of wine. the little old grey man met him likewise and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine. he lifted her up and taking her with him went to an inn where he thought he would stay the night. now the host had three daughters who saw the goose and were curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be and would have liked to have one of its golden feathers. the second came soon afterwards thinking only of how she might get a feather for herself but she had scarcely touched her sister than she was held fast. so they had to spend the night with the goose. they were obliged to run after him continually now left now right just as he was inclined to go. for a long time the king could not be comforted and had no thought of taking another wife. in the whole world however none was to be found and even if one had been found still there would have been no one who had such golden hair. now the king had a daughter who was just as beautiful as her dead mother and had the same golden hair. when she was grown up the king looked at her one day and saw that in every respect she was like his late wife and suddenly felt a violent love for her. and as she was tired she got into a hollow tree and fell asleep. the sun rose and she slept on and she was still sleeping when it was full day. then it so happened that the king to whom this forest belonged was hunting in it. alas fair princess what is to become of thee now and she opened the nut and took out her dress which shone like the sun and when she had done that she went up to the festival and every one made way for her for no one knew her and thought no otherwise than that she was a kings daughter. when the dancing was over the king had his soup brought and ate it and he liked it so much that it seemed to him he had never tasted better. then he ordered the cook to appear before him. then she went up and was like a princess and the king stepped forward to meet her and rejoiced to see her once more and as the dance was just beginning they danced it together. but when it was ended she again disappeared so quickly that the king could not observe where she went. when for the third time the king held a festival all happened just as it had done before. and now she put on the dress which shone like the stars and thus entered the hall. again the king danced with the beautiful maiden and thought that she never yet had been so beautiful. and whilst she was dancing he contrived without her noticing it to slip a golden ring on her finger and he had given orders that the dance should last a very long time. when it was ended he wanted to hold her fast by her hands but she tore herself loose and sprang away so quickly through the crowd that she vanished from his sight. the king clutched the mantle and tore it off. that i can tell you as another told it to me. the girl however was sad for she was all alone. the little hare goes away. the little hare goes away. then the little hare sees that it is not his bride and goes away and is sorrowful. and when he was sitting beside her and very happy news came that his father lay sick unto death and desired to see him once again before his end. then she inquired if he required any huntsmen and if he would take the whole of them into his service. the king however had a lion which was a wondrous animal for he knew all concealed and secret things. then he saw the ring which he had given to his first bride and when he looked in her face he recognized her. thereupon the wedding was celebrated and the lion was again taken into favour because after all he had told the truth. they walk a long time and come into a great forest where stands a little house with an old woman in it. on the way a carriage comes driving by. they go home together. so the man goes home with the horse and puts it in the stable. if any one came within one hundred paces of the castle he was obliged to stand still and could not stir from the place until she bade him be free. one day in order that they might be able to talk together in quiet they went for a walk in the forest. then they looked around them and were quite at a loss for they did not know by which way they should go home. the sun was still half above the mountain and half set. the sun had now set. she muttered to herself caught the nightingale and took it away in her hand. he often walked round and round the castle but not too near to it. day and night he journeyed with this flower to the castle. when he was within a hundred paces of it he was not held fast but walked on to the door. he walked in through the courtyard and listened for the sound of the birds. at last he heard it. just then he saw the old woman quietly take away a cage with a bird in it and go towards the door. swiftly he sprang towards her touched the cage with the flower and also the old woman. they certainly knew when it was morning or evening but at night if they did not sleep through it not one of them knew how to find out the time. they asked if the creature were for sale and how much he wanted for it when the corn was ripe there they took cannon out to the fields and shot it down. and now the third brother wanted to take his cat to the right man. but now the cat began her chase and soon cleared a couple of rooms and the people begged the king to buy the wonderful beast for the country. the king willingly gave what was asked which was a mule laden with gold and the third brother came home with the greatest treasure of all. the cat made herself merry with the mice in the royal palace and killed so many that they could not be counted. in a short time he reached the well filled his pitcher with water and turned back. and now all would have been lost if by good luck the huntsman had not been standing at the top of the castle and had not seen everything with his sharp eyes. he did not lose heart however but ran back to the well with his pitcher again drew some water and was at home again ten minutes before the kings daughter. when an hour or two had passed by and the king believed that they had perished in the heat he had the doors opened to behold them himself. but when the doors were opened all six were standing there alive and well and said that they should very much like to get out to warm themselves for the very food was fast frozen to the dishes with the cold. then full of anger the king went down to the cook scolded him and asked why he had not done what he had been ordered to do. and when it was ready the strong one who could tear up trees had to take it on his back and go with it to the king. then they were driven away from each other and carried into the blue sky over all the mountains one here the other there. the wolf devoured it but was not satisfied with one he wanted the other as well and went to get it. this made such a great noise that the woman came out and when she saw the wolf she called the people who hurried there and beat him as long as their sticks would hold together till with two lame legs and howling loudly he got back to the fox in the forest. when the fox saw him he was out of the hole at one bound. the wolf wanted to follow him but he had made himself so fat with eating that he could no longer get through but stuck fast. at last she escaped and dragged herself outside. how is all with you dost thou venture to ask how i am getting on what hast thou learnt every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild beasts were kept and washed herself there in a clear stream. it happened once when the child was a little older that it was lying in her arms and she fell asleep. then came the old cook who knew that the child had the power of wishing and stole it away and he took a hen and cut it in pieces and dropped some of its blood on the queens apron and on her dress. here she was to stay for seven years without meat or drink and die of hunger. the thought however occurred to him that the kings son might some day wish to be with his father and thus bring him into great peril. the kings son remained there a short while longer and he thought of his mother and wondered if she were still alive. he went to the tower in which his mother was confined and as it was so high he wished for a ladder which would reach up to the very top. so he summoned all the huntsmen together and bade them go out into the forest with him. two hundred deer and more came running inside the circle at once and the huntsmen shot them. now the king felt great joy at this and commanded that his entire household should eat with him next day and made a great feast. on this the huntsman asked the king if he would like to see the dog in his true shape and wished him back into the form of the cook in the which he stood immediately with his white apron and his knife by his side. his son married the beautiful maiden whom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket and whether they are still alive or not is known to god. the fowls began to turn brown and were nearly ready but the guest had not yet arrived. how good fowls are hush the guest however thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of his ears and ran as if fire were burning under him in order to take them both home with him. and he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of tears. once too his trembling hands could not hold the bowl and it fell to the ground and broke. the young wife scolded him but he said nothing and only sighed. then the little cock took the water to the hen but when he got there the hen had choked in the meantime and lay there dead and motionless. then the procession went onwards and they reached the stream. when a stone saw that it took pity on the little cock wished to help him and laid itself over the water. then the cock drew the carriage himself but when he got it over and reached the other shore with the dead hen and was about to draw over the others who were sitting behind as well there were too many of them the carriage ran back and they all fell into the water together and were drowned. st. peter thanked him went onwards and threw himself again in the soldiers way as a beggar but in another shape and when he came up begged a gift of him as before. st. peter thanked him and went onwards but for the third time placed himself in another shape as a beggar on the road and spoke to brother lustig. they went farther and then st. peter caused a great stream of water to flow right across their path and they were obliged to pass through it. so brother lustig began to go through also but the water grew deeper and reached to his throat. then they journeyed onwards and came to a kingdom where they heard that the kings daughter lay sick unto death. then he cut off all the dead girls limbs and threw them in the water lighted a fire beneath the kettle and boiled them. and when the flesh had fallen away from the bones he took out the beautiful white bones and laid them on a table and arranged them together in their natural order. then he arrived in a certain country where he heard that a kings daughter was dead. then brother lustig ordered water to be brought to him in a kettle bade every one go out cut the limbs off threw them in the water and lighted a fire beneath just as he had seen st. peter do. the water began to boil the flesh fell off and then he took the bones out and laid them on the table but he did not know the order in which to lay them and placed them all wrong and in confusion. then st. peter went away again by the window and brother lustig was rejoiced to find that all had passed off so well but was very much vexed to think that after all he was not to take anything for it. as he was sitting there drinking the smell of roast goose made its way to his nose. brother lustig looked about and peeped and saw that the host had two geese standing in the oven. the soldier was here but he went out by the door like an honest fellow. brother lustig went his way and came to a place where there was a magnificent castle and not far from it a wretched inn. he soon fell asleep but during the night was disturbed by a great noise and when he awoke he saw nine ugly devils in the room who had made a circle and were dancing around him. after this all was suddenly quiet and brother lustig lay down again and slept till it was bright day. when he opened the knapsack after this eight of them were dead but one which had been lying in a fold of it was still alive slipped out and went back again to hell. then brother lustig gave him the knapsack into heaven through the bars and st. peter took it and hung it beside his seat. meanwhile st. peter and the lord were waiting and as he was so long in coming they set out to meet him. so he took it to them and the two passed the night there. the lord gave him all that he had asked and departed with st. peter. hans pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket wrapped up the lump in it put it on his shoulder and set out on the way home. never again will i mount it. now i like your cow for one can walk quietly behind her and have over and above ones milk butter and cheese every day without fail. hans drove his cow quietly before him and thought over his lucky bargain. then he drove his cow onwards along the road to his mothers village. and as he set himself to work in a clumsy way the impatient beast at last gave him such a blow on his head with its hind foot that he fell on the ground and for a long time could not think where he was. hans told him what had happened. certainly it is a fine thing when one can kill a beast like that at home what meat one has presently there joined him a lad who was carrying a fine white goose under his arm. hunger also tormented him for in his joy at the bargain by which he got the cow he had eaten up all his store of food at once. at last he could only go on with great trouble and was forced to stop every minute the stones too weighed him down dreadfully. then he could not help thinking how nice it would be if he had not to carry them just then. when hans saw them with his own eyes sinking to the bottom he jumped for joy and then knelt down and with tears in his eyes thanked god for having shown him this favour also and delivered him in so good a way and without his having any need to reproach himself from those heavy stones which had been the only things that troubled him. with a light heart and free from every burden he now ran on until he was with his mother at home. he therefore seated hans behind the stove and had it made very hot. and as soon as the secret was out the splendid castle with the cupboard immediately disappeared they were once more in the old fishermans hut and the man was obliged to follow his former trade and fish. but fortune would so have it that he once more drew out the golden fish. the man kept silence for a short time but at last she made him so angry that he broke out and betrayed the secret. in an instant the castle disappeared and they were back again in their old hut. the children grew up became tall and handsome and the lilies and horses grew likewise. but the other rode forward and reached a great forest. as he was about to enter it the people said it is not safe for you to ride through the wood is full of robbers who would treat you badly. nevertheless the idea never left his thoughts so that next morning he rose early wishing to see whether his daughters husband was a common ragged beggar. the large one belonged to a rich man and the small one to a poor man. so the lord turned his back on the rich man and went across to the small house and knocked. he had hardly done so when the poor man opened the little door and bade the traveler come in. when the cloth was laid the lord sat down with the man and his wife and he enjoyed their coarse food for there were happy faces at the table. but the lord was unwilling to take their bed from the two old folks however they would not be satisfied until at length he did it and lay down in their bed while they themselves lay on some straw on the ground. when the sun shone in through the little window and the lord had got up he again ate with them and then prepared to set out on his journey. last night there was a miserable little hut standing there and today there is a beautiful new house. if i had but known that and thus was his first wish fulfilled. the saddle hurt his back and he had not yet any idea what to wish for. then it came into his mind what an easy life his wife had for she stayed at home in a cool room and enjoyed herself. then he really did feel warm. he began to run and wanted to be quite alone in his own room at home to think of something really large for his last wish. but as he approached the tree a lion leapt from beneath it shook himself and roared till the leaves on the trees trembled. the lion however was an enchanted prince and was by day a lion and all his people were lions with him but in the night they resumed their natural human shapes. on her arrival she was kindly received and led into the castle. there was great joy when she arrived for they had all believed that she had been torn in pieces by the lion and had long ceased to live. so she went continually further and further in the wide world never looking about her or resting and the seven years were almost past then she rejoiced and thought that they would soon be delivered and yet they were so far from it once when they were thus moving onwards no little feather and no drop of red blood fell and when she raised her eyes the dove had disappeared. after that look round and thou wilt see the griffin which is by the red sea swing thyself with thy beloved on to his back and the bird will carry you over the sea to your own home. but when the princess who had before been the dragon was delivered from enchantment she took the youth by the arm seated herself on the griffin and carried him off with her. so she took it out and put it on and went up into the castle and everyone even the bride herself looked at her with astonishment. when therefore day broke she was led out again and had to give up the golden dress. then she arose and drove them through the meadow before her until the bride looked out of the window. the little chickens pleased her so much that she immediately came down and asked if they were for sale. she was conducted upstairs but the real princess was left standing below. then the old king looked out of the window and saw her standing in the courtyard and how dainty and delicate and beautiful she was and instantly went to the royal apartment and asked the bride about the girl she had with her who was standing down below in the courtyard and who she was then he came back again and bade her come out of the stove. and royal garments were placed on her and it was marvellous how beautiful she was the young king rejoiced with all his heart when he saw her beauty and youth and a great feast was made ready to which all the people and all good friends were invited. whilst he was there a great giant came over the hill. his father stood by but could not utter a sound for terror and he thought nothing else but that his child was lost and that as long as he lived he should never set eyes on him again. when he tried him his strength had increased so much that he could tear an old tree out of the ground. the youth however ate the whole of it himself and asked if she had nothing more to set before him. the youth laid it across his knees and snap he arrived at a village wherein lived a smith who was a greedy fellow who never did a kindness to any one but wanted everything for himself. about eleven oclock he went into the millers room and sat down on the bench. as he was hungry and saw the food he too place himself at the table ate with those who were eating and enjoyed it. and so it continued the whole night. when the miller had got up he wanted to look after him and wondered if he were still alive. and when harvest time came the apples on this tree were all as red as blood. the three daughters went every day beneath the tree and looked to see if the wind had not blown down an apple but they never by any chance found one and the tree was so loaded with them that it was almost breaking and the branches hung down to the ground. he sought them everywhere in the palace and garden but could not find them. then he was much troubled and made known to the whole land that whosoever brought his daughters back again should have one of them to wife. they cast lots and the lot fell on the eldest so next day the two younger went out to seek and the eldest had to stay home. canst thou not pick up that piece thyself then he showed him a deep well but there was no water in it. the two other brothers would also be very glad to recover the kings daughters but they did not want to have any trouble or danger. then the two were so angry at this that they grew green and yellow. next morning they went to the well together and drew lots who should first seat himself in the basket and again the lot fell on the eldest and he was to seat himself in it and take the bell with him. then the second seated himself in the basket but he did just the same as the first and then it was the turn of the youngest but he let himself be lowered quite to the bottom. then he went to the second princess who had a dragon with five heads to comb and delivered her also and to the youngest who had a dragon with four heads he went likewise. and they all rejoiced and embraced him and kissed him without stopping. so he took a great stone which was lying there and placed it in the basket and when it was about half way up his false brothers above cut the rope so that the basket with the stone fell to the ground and they thought that he was dead and ran away with the three princesses making them promise to tell their father that it was they who had delivered them and then they went to the king and each demanded a princess in marriage. then he played until the room was entirely filled. they all asked what he desired so he said he wished to get above ground back to daylight on which they seized him by every hair that grew on his head and thus they flew with him onto the earth again. when he was above ground he at once went to the kings palace just as the wedding of one princess was about to be celebrated and he went to the room where the king and his three daughters were. when the princesses came to themselves however they entreated the king to set him free again. the king asked why and they said that they were not allowed to tell that but their father said that they were to tell it to the stove. and he went out listened at the door and heard everything. a month afterwards he went up to the garret intending to gather together some old tin and to sell it and saw a great heap of money lying. in the meantime the boy grew tall and at the same time sharp and clever. he said likewise that he had set his hand and seal to this and that now when twelve years had gone by he would have to give him up. so he took leave of his father placed himself in a little boat and the father had to push it off with his own foot. the boat however did not sink but floated quietly away and the boy sat safely inside it and it floated thus for a long time until at last it stopped by an unknown shore. then he landed and saw a beautiful castle before him and set out to go to it. but when he entered it he found that it was bewitched. i will come to thee and will have in a bottle some of the water of life. after this their marriage was celebrated and he was king of the golden mountain. they lived very happily together and the queen bore a fine boy. then he told them that he was king of the golden mountain and a kings daughter was his wife and that they had a fine son of seven years old. this he did and the sword cut in two the trunk of a tree as if it had been a blade of straw. he placed himself behind her and no one saw him. when she put a piece of meat on a plate for herself he took it away and ate it and when she poured out a glass of wine for herself he took it away and drank it. she was always helping herself to something and yet she never got anything for plate and glass disappeared immediately. one day the child was naughty and the mother might say what she liked but the child would not be quiet. it flew into a dark forest and stayed in it a long time and the parents heard nothing of their child. for three days i will come every afternoon at two oclock in a carriage. she alighted from the carriage went to him shook him and called him but he did not awake. next day about noon the old woman came again and brought him food and drink but he would not take any of it. but she let him have no rest and persuaded him until at length he again took one drink out of the glass. he could not help himself and was forced to lie down and fell into a heavy sleep. next day the old woman asked what was the meaning of this he was neither eating nor drinking anything did he want to die at two oclock the raven came with four black horses and the coachman and everything else was black. after he had walked about the world for a long time he entered into a dark forest and walked for fourteen days and still could not find his way out. then it was once more evening and he was so tired that he lay down in a thicket and fell asleep. next day he went onwards and in the evening as he was again about to lie down beneath some bushes he heard such a howling and crying that he could not go to sleep. then he came to a house which seemed very small for in front of it a great giant was standing. he rejoiced when he saw her and wanted to climb up to her but when he began to do so he always slipped down the glass again. one of them said that he found a stick and that when he struck a door with it that door would spring open. then he struck the door with his stick and it sprang open immediately. he went in and ascended the stairs until he came to the hall where the maiden was sitting with a golden cup full of wine before her. she however could not see him because he had the mantle on. and when he came up to her he drew from his finger the ring which she had given him and threw it into the cup so that it rang. when they came to the door they saw him and cried aloud in their delight. when they had dug nearly the whole of the field they found in the earth a mortar made of pure gold. the king took the mortar and asked if he had found nothing besides that if i had but listened to my daughter she at once said yes she would guess it. when the king passed by and saw that he sent his messenger to ask what the stupid man was about the peasant must confess this at once. the idea was his own. they laid him however on a heap of straw and beat him and tormented him so long that at last he admitted that he had got the idea from the queen. then she ordered a powerful sleeping draught to be brought to drink farewell to him the king took a long draught but she took only a little. he soon fell into a deep sleep and when she perceived that she called a servant and took a fair white linen cloth and wrapped the king in it and the servant was forced to carry him into a carriage that stood before the door and she drove with him to her own little house. the peasant woman too was quite willing. he was however hardly gone before the woman got up and the parson was there directly. dont you know what it means when they got to the house hurrah but all was going merry there the gossip knocked at the door and woman asked who was there. the parson however and the woman were as merry as possible. the king heard all this and when he had come back from the chase he caused the three girls to be brought to him and asked them what they had said yesterday on the mountain. this they would not tell him so the king asked the eldest if she really would take him for her husband but the two sisters had no children and once when the king was obliged to go from home he invited them to come to the queen in order to cheer her for she was about to bear a child. she had a little boy who brought a bright red star into the world with him. then the two sisters said to each other that they would throw the beautiful boy into the water. when the king came home they told him that the queen had been delivered of a dog. when a year had gone by the king again went away and the queen had another little boy whom the false sisters likewise took and threw into the water. then the king again journeyed forth and the queen had a little girl whom also the false sisters threw into the water. in the meantime the children had grown up. the fisherman told him that once when he was fishing he had drawn him out of the water. so the boy said he would go forth and seek his father. then the boy went on his way and walked for many days and at last he came to a great piece of water by the side of which stood an old woman fishing. when a year had gone by the second boy set out to seek his brother. then you will come to a great high castle on the threshold of which you must let the wand fall and go straight through the castle and out again on the other side. take likewise a glass of water out of the fountain and with these two things go back by the same way. they went together to the place where the black dog was lying on the road she struck it in the face and it turned into a handsome prince who went with them to the river. there the old woman was still standing. she rejoiced much to see them again and carried them all over the water and then she too went away for now she was freed. the others however went to the old fisherman and all were glad that they had found each other again but they hung the bird on the wall. she had however grown quite ill and weak. then the daughter gave her some of the water of the fountain to drink and she became strong and healthy. but the two false sisters were burnt and the daughter married the prince. there they met an old man who inquired as to the cause of their grief. they told him that their father was so ill that he would most certainly die for nothing seemed to cure him. but the little dwarf had grown angry and had wished an evil wish. the sick king waited long for him but he came not. so fare haughty people. as the second son also remained away the youngest begged to be allowed to go forth to fetch the water and at last the king was obliged to let him go. when he arrived everything was as the dwarf had said. a sword and a loaf of bread were lying there which he carried away. so he lay down and fell asleep. when he awoke it was striking a quarter to twelve. he sprang up in a fright ran to the spring drew some water in a cup which stood near and hastened away. but just as he was passing through the iron door the clock struck twelve and the door fell to with such violence that it carried away a piece of his heel. the prince then took back his loaf and his sword and the three brothers rode on. we took it from you whilst you were asleep at sea and when a year is over one of us will go and fetch the beautiful princess. so he summoned the court together and had sentence pronounced upon his son that he should be secretly shot. therefore he rode forth and when he arrived in front of the palace and saw the splendid golden road he thought it would be a sin and a shame if he were to ride over that and turned aside and rode on the right side of it. but when he came to the door the servants told him that he was not the right man and was to go away again. soon after this the second prince set out and when he came to the golden road and his horse had put one foot on it he thought it would be a sin and a shame to tread a piece of it off and he turned aside and rode on the left side of it and when he reached the door the attendants told him he was not the right one and he was to go away again. so he rode thither and told him everything how his brothers had betrayed him and how he had nevertheless kept silence. the old king wished to punish them but they had put to sea and never came back as long as they lived. so he remained standing a while and at length inquired if he too could not be a doctor. yes he was he said. then he was to go with him and bring back the stolen money. they led him to the spot where the money was concealed. let me out dost thou think that i was shut up there for such a long time as a favour. no it was a punishment for me. thou hast nothing but what i give thee. so he went out into the forest and when he had walked for a short time he met a little man who was however the devil. you shall serve me for seven years and after that you shall again be free. then he told him what he had to do. when the old devil came back again he looked to see if all had been done appeared satisfied and went forth a second time. then he wanted to see who might be sitting up in the third kettle it was actually be but a general. but the knapsack full of gold remained before the eyes of the landlord and left him no peace and during the night he crept in and stole it away. next morning however when hans got up and wanted to pay the landlord and travel further behold his knapsack was gone there was however an old king in that country before whom he had to play and the king was so delighted with his playing that he promised him his eldest daughter in marriage. his parents were dead and he had no longer a home so he went to his brothers and begged them to take him in and keep him until war broke out again. i will give thee a coat and a cloak which during this time thou must wear. the soldier put the coat on felt at once in the pocket and found that the thing was really true. whosoever saw him ran away but as he everywhere gave the poor money to pray that he might not die during the seven years and as he paid well for everything he still always found shelter. in the fourth year he entered an inn where the landlord would not receive him and would not even let him have a place in the stable because he was afraid the horses would be scared. when the old man saw himself set free from all his troubles he did not know how to be grateful enough. when the eldest saw him she was so terribly alarmed at his face that she screamed and ran away. he took a ring from his finger broke it in two and gave her one half the other he kept for himself. he went into the town put on a magnificent velvet coat seated himself in a carriage drawn by four white horses and drove to his brides house. no one recognized him the father took him for a distinguished general and led him into the room where his daughters were sitting. the bride however sat opposite to him in her black dress and never raised her eyes nor spoke a word. the stranger as soon as he was alone with his bride brought out his half of the ring and threw it in a glass of wine which he reached across the table to her. she took the wine but when she had drunk it and found the half ring lying at the bottom her heart began to beat. she got the other half which she wore on a ribbon round her neck joined them and saw that the two pieces fitted exactly together. one of them drowned herself in the well the other hanged herself on a tree. the bear however could not rest until he had seen the royal palace and when a short time had passed again went to it. the king and queen had just flown out so he peeped in and saw five or six young ones lying in it. our parents are honest people when the animals saw that they thought all was lost and began to fly each into his hole and the birds had won the battle. the girl took the pot home to her mother and now they were freed from their poverty and hunger and ate sweet porridge as often as they chose. so it went on cooking and the porridge rose over the edge and still it cooked on until the kitchen and whole house were full and then the next house and then the whole street just as if it wanted to satisfy the hunger of the whole world and there was the greatest distress but no one knew how to stop it. have no fear however you shall have security for my paying. he keeps sheep and the sheep give him a great deal to do. they run up the mountains and lose their way in the wilderness and he has to run after them and drive them together again. his clothes are all torn to pieces too and will soon fall off his body. when the woman got home again she found her son who had come in from the field. the youth remained sitting there till night fell but the peasant never came back. there was once a little child whose mother gave her every afternoon a small bowl of milk and bread and the child seated herself in the yard with it. from that time forth a change came over the child. as long as the snake had eaten with her she had grown tall and strong but now she lost her pretty rosy cheeks and wasted away. second story. as soon as the snake saw it it went back then returned bringing with it a small golden crown laid it on the handkerchief and then went away again. if the girl had but left the crown where it was the snake would certainly have brought still more of its treasures out of the hole. third story. the two sharp ones waited until hans had fallen asleep then they got up and went away leaving him where he was. and they thought they had done a very clever thing but it was certain to turn out ill for them. when the sun arose and hans woke up he was lying in a deep cavern. in the evening when they sat down to dinner three of them had to make music. nevertheless the seven years had gone by with him as if they were six months. the cat asked him if he would like to see her horses then she opened the door of the small house and when she had opened it there stood twelve horses such horses so bright and shining that his heart rejoiced at the sight of them. they asked hans where his horse was. in the morning when he awoke the three days had passed and a coach came with six horses and they shone so bright that it was delightful to see them and a servant brought a seventh as well which was for the poor millers boy. so she ordered the servant to bring the seventh horse and when the miller saw it he said that such a horse as that had never yet entered his yard. they first drove to the little house which he had built with the silver tools and behold it was a great castle and everything inside it was of silver and gold and then she married him and he was rich so rich that he had enough for all the rest of his life. after this let no one ever say that anyone who is silly can never become a person of importance. in this way a shoemaker and a tailor once met with each other in their travels. the tailor was a handsome little fellow who was always merry and full of enjoyment. both of them had time enough but little to bite and to break. when he again fell in with the shoemaker the tailor had always the most in his bundle. when they had travelled for some time they came to a great forest through which passed the road to the capital. i shall trust in god and not trouble myself about anything besides why should we not find the right way it was as quiet there as in a church. but on the fifth morning the poor tailor could no longer stand up and was hardly able to utter one word for weakness his cheeks were white and his eyes red. when times were good with me i shared what i had with thee. then he gave him a bit of bread to eat held out a stick to him and drew him on behind him. when the sun went down they got out of the forest and before them in the open country stood the gallows. he took a needle out of his pocket and as he could thread it as well as ever he had done his heart danced with delight. he threw himself on his knees thanked god for the mercy he had shown him and said his morning prayer. but the little tailor had eaten nothing since the day before. the stork rose up let its long legs hang down and flew gently away. when he turned round he was standing in front of an old tree which was partly hollow and saw some wild bees flying in and out of it. as however he had thoroughly learnt his trade it was not long before he became famous and every one wanted to have his new coat made by the little tailor whose importance increased daily. but how things do happen in the world when the latter caught sight of the tailor and saw that he had once more two healthy eyes his conscience troubled him. she knew him again instantly and asked why he was hanging his head so the crown fell into the water and lies down below at the bottom we will soon bring it up again for thee. they swam to the shore and put the crown on the handkerchief. the tailor tied his handkerchief together by the four corners and carried it to the king who was full of joy and put a gold chain round the tailors neck. when he came to the hollow tree he sat down and hung his head. the tailor wrapped it carefully in his cloth and took it to the king who could not admire it enough placed it in his largest hall and in return for it presented the tailor with a large stone house. it galloped as quick as lightning thrice round it and at the third time it fell violently down. when the king saw that he arose in amazement and went and embraced the tailor in the sight of all men. but good fortune did not last long. the king had daughters in plenty one still prettier than the other but he had no son. sometimes he stood still took a frog into close consideration and at length swallowed it down. the stork came to him and greeted him. go home and be easy. he had moreover a baby in his beak that was as lovely as an angel and stretched out its little hands to the queen. before the stork flew away he took his travelling bag off his back and handed it over to the queen. the eldest however had none of them but got the merry tailor for a husband. the road to the forest led him to the gallows. worn out with anger rage and the heat of the day he threw himself down. in his madness he ran into the forest and must have died there of hunger for no one has ever either seen him again or heard of him. now it happened that there was a fair in the town and the peasant was about to go to it and asked his wife what he should bring back with him for her. once a king came travelling by who had lost his way and heard the music. he was astonished at it and sent his servant forth to look all round and see from whence this music came. then the king told the servant he was to ask why he sat there and if he knew the road which led to his kingdom. then he remembered hans the hedgehog and told her what had happened and that he had been forced to promise whatsoever first met him when he got home to a very strange animal which sat on a cock as if it were a horse and made beautiful music but that instead of writing that he should have what he wanted he had written that he should not have it. thereupon the princess was glad and said he had done well for she never would have gone away with the hedgehog. then hans the hedgehog got down the tree with the cock and told the aged king that he would show him the way if he would give him for his own whatsoever first met him in front of his royal palace. that done hans rode on before him on the cock and pointed out the way and the king reached his kingdom again in safety. now he had an only daughter who was very beautiful she ran to meet him threw her arms round his neck and was delighted to have her old father back again. she asked him where in the world he had been so long. but on this she promised that for love of her father she would willingly go with this hans if he came. when his father heard that he was troubled for he thought hans the hedgehog had died long ago. ha hans the hedgehog rode away to the first kingdom. then the king began to speak his daughter fair and to beg her to go away with hans in order to save her own life and her fathers. but when the kings daughter saw him she was terrified for he looked quite too strange. she remembered however that she could not change her mind for she had given her promise to her father. when several years had passed he went with his wife to his father and said that he was his son. then hans made himself known and the old father rejoiced and went with him to his kingdom. my tale is done and away it has run to little augusts house. now it so happened that he suddenly became ill and god took him to himself and for this the mother could not be comforted and wept both day and night. but soon afterwards when the child had been buried it appeared by night in the places where it had sat and played during its life and if the mother wept it wept also and when morning came it disappeared. moreover he never complained but was contented with everything and always merry. when the third year also was past the master considered put his hand in his pocket but pulled nothing out. if it were but mine murder for goodness sake do not allow it woes me so he travelled about and looked for work. then he set out and found himself in a very large forest which he could not get to the end of in one day. when evening came he seated himself in a high tree in order to escape from the wild beasts. then he looked down through the branches towards it and kept well in his mind where it was. but in the first place he took off his hat and threw it down in the direction of the light so that he might go to the hat as a mark when he had descended. then he got down and went to his hat put it on again and went straight forwards. but when he was just about to bite into it the huntsman again shot it away from him. when the giants saw that they rejoiced and thought they already had the kings daughter safe but the huntsman wished first to see how matters stood and told them that they must stay outside until he called them. then he went into the castle and all was perfectly quiet within and every one was asleep. so he took the sword from the wall hung it at his side and went onwards then he entered the room where the kings daughter was lying sleeping and she was so beautiful that he stood still and holding his breath looked at her. but he cried to them that they were to come in for the maiden was already in their power that he could not open the gate to them but there was a hole through which they must creep. then the first approached and the huntsman wound the giants hair round his hand pulled the head in and cut it off at one stroke with his sword and then drew the rest of him in. he called to the second and cut his head off likewise and then he killed the third also and he was well pleased that he had freed the beautiful maiden from her enemies and he cut out their tongues and put them in his knapsack. the king summoned his whole court together soldiers and every one else who was there and asked who had set his daughter at liberty and killed the giants then the old king said that as he had accomplished this he should marry his daughter. he was charmed with the beautiful maiden who was indeed as lovely as any picture. he asked her if she were the kings daughter. on this they went together to the old king and fetched him to the hut and she led him into her room and told him that the huntsman was the man who had really set her free from the giants. then she dressed the huntsman as if he were a foreign lord and the king ordered a feast to be prepared. when they went to table the captain sat on the left side of the kings daughter but the huntsman was on the right and the captain thought he was a foreign lord who had come on a visit. when they had eaten and drunk the old king said to the captain that he would set before him something which he must guess. after this he brought his father and mother and they lived with their son in happiness and after the death of the old king he received the kingdom. i call that well sold on the way however he lost one seed out of the bag. in the meantime when he went on his way back the seed had grown into a tree which reached up to the sky. but he came down on the earth exactly in the middle of a deep deep hole. in the forest the kings son was separated from the others and all at once he saw a great stag which he wanted to shoot but could not hit. and the kings son lay down on the threshold put his hand under his head and slept. and the kings son laid himself down on the threshold of the door and slept. then he was much troubled and believed he would have to die and sat down and wept. when she got into the forest she asked him how he was getting on they began at once and when the three hours were over all was done and they came back to the kings daughter and told her so. then he was much troubled. at noon the youngest daughter brought him something to eat and asked him how he was getting on so the kings son said everything was going very ill with him and he would certainly have to lose his head. then the kings daughter went away also and told him that when it was six he was to come to the house. that was very good. then he was quite miserable and waited for his dearest to see if she would not come and help him in his need. he went to meet her and told her all and ate something and let her comb his hair and fell asleep. when therefore the kings son awoke and saw everything done he was as happy as a bird in air. when it had struck six they went home together. but he went by night to the kings daughter and ran away with her. when they had got a little distance away the kings daughter peeped round and saw her father behind her. my father is behind us and will take us back with him. his wife asked why he had not brought their daughter back with him so he listened to the sermon and then went home again. she wanted to catch the fish but she could not. and when they had walked quite ten miles they arrived at the castle from whence the kings son came and close by it was a village. when the kings son was about to get in his mother gave him a kiss and he forgot everything which had happened and also what he was about to do. on this his mother ordered the horses to be taken out of the carriage again and everyone went back into the house. but the maiden sat in the village and watched and watched and thought he would come and fetch her but no one came. in the meantime the queen had sought a wife for her son who came from quite a distant part of the world. when the bride came they were at once to be married. and many people hurried together all of whom wanted to see everything. then the girl said to the miller that he might be so good as to give her leave to go also. she put it on and went into the church and stood by the altar. suddenly came the bride and bridegroom and seated themselves before the altar and when the priest was just going to bless them the bride peeped half round and saw the maiden standing there. then she stood up again and said she would not be given away until she also had as beautiful a dress as that lady there. so they went back to the house again and sent to ask the lady if she would sell that dress. no she would not sell it but the bride might perhaps earn it. then the bride asked her how she was to do this then the maiden said if she might sleep one night outside the kings sons door the bride might have what she wanted. the kings son did not hear one word of it but the servants had been awakened and had listened to it and had not known what it could mean. the next morning when they were all up the bride put on the dress and went away to the church with the bridegroom. she put it on and went and stood by the altar in the church and everything happened as it had happened the time before. all this the kings son heard and was sore troubled and what was past came back to him. then he wanted to go to her but his mother had locked the door. the next morning however he went at once to his beloved and told her everything which had happened to him and prayed her not to be angry with him for having forgotten her. but the false mother and the bride had to depart. and the mouth of the person who last told all this is still warm. when the bear saw that he was seized with a desire to have some nuts too. the bear put them in his mouth but could get nothing out of them let him bite as he would. but no one will imagine that he accomplished it. what dost thou think of that in the morning she arose careless and happy but when she peeped into the stable the tailor stood gaily before her and was as healthy as a fish in water. now she could not say another word against the wedding because she had given a promise before every one and the king ordered a carriage to be brought in which she was to drive to church with the tailor and there she was to be married. the bear in great fury ran after the carriage. after a long time when he and his wife had two children the wifes father and mother died and the young people kept house alone. after this he again charged her particularly never to tell this or he would lose his life and she did promise. and thus after all the bright sun did bring it to light. when darkness came on he saw a light which he went up to and came to a house wherein lived a witch. he found the blue light and made her a signal to draw him up again. she did draw him up but when he came near the edge she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the blue light away from him. he saw very well that he could not escape death. he sat for a while very sorrowfully then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe which was still half full. on the way the dwarf showed him the treasures which the witch had collected and hidden there and the soldier took as much gold as he could carry. the soldier returned to the town from which he had come. next morning when the princess arose she went to her father and told him that she had had a very strange dream. next morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughters shoe. when he was led forth to die he begged a last favor of the king. the king was terrified he threw himself on the soldiers mercy and merely to be allowed to live at all gave him his kingdom for his own and the princess to wife. when she had been lowered into her grave and the earth was spread over her all at once her arm came out again and stretched upwards and when they had put it in and spread fresh earth over it it was all to no purpose for the arm always came out again. the host asked whence they came and whither they were going then they cut the hand heart and eyes from their bodies as they had said they would and laid them all together on a plate and gave it to the innkeeper. the innkeeper gave it to a servant who was to set it in the cupboard and take good care of it. the girl however had a lover in secret who was a soldier. when the soldier had done eating and the girl was taking away the things and going to shut the cupboard she saw that the plate which the innkeeper had given her to take care of was empty. after this he caught the cat and cut its eyes out and now nothing but the heart was wanting. the girl placed all together on the plate and put it in the cupboard and when after this her lover took leave of her she went quietly to bed. the second took the cats eyes and put them in his own head. then they paid their bill and travelled farther. i dont see at all. they went into the bar together and there at a table in the corner sat a rich man counting money. the one with the thiefs hand walked round about him made a sudden movement twice with his arm and at last when the stranger turned away he snatched at the pile of money and took a handful from it. then the three said he must give them a great deal of money or they would set his house on fire. he gave them what he had and whatever he could get together and the three went away with it. then they journeyed onwards. ho ho this awakened the hare which in great alarm darted swiftly away. as a beginning he at once gave them as much as they could carry and told them to go to such and such an inn when they got to the town. they went to it and the innkeeper came to meet them and asked if they wished for anything to eat good meat and drink were now brought to them and they were well waited on. as he was carrying the trunk into his room he felt that it was heavy with gold. when it was midnight and the host thought that all were asleep he came with his wife and they had an axe and struck the rich merchant dead and after they had murdered him they went to bed again. it came to pass that he got to the house of a giant and as he was so tired he sat down by the door and rested. then he took leave of the giant and went forth over mountain and valley and through plains and forests until at length he came to the wondrous garden. the beasts lay round about it but they had put their heads down and were asleep. moreover they did not awake when he went up to them so he stepped over them climbed the fence and got safely into the garden. there in the very middle of it stood the tree of life and the red apples were shining upon the branches. he climbed up the trunk to the top and as he was about to reach out for an apple he saw a ring hanging before it but he thrust his hand through that without any difficulty and gathered the apple. when he had come down again from the tree with the apple he would not climb over the fence but grasped the great gate and had no need to shake it more than once before it sprang open with a loud crash. he therefore demanded the ring from him but the kings son refused it. and now the unhappy kings son stood there and was blind and knew not how to help himself. then the giant came back to him took him by the hand as if he were someone who wanted to guide him and led him to the top of a high rock. when they had got close to the edge the giant let the blind mans hand drop and was going to leave him behind alone but the lion pushed the giant so that he was thrown down and fell dashed to pieces on the ground. the kings son thanked god for his great mercy and travelled with his lion onwards through the world. and it came to pass that he arrived before a castle which was enchanted. the screaming became still louder so that no one could have heard it without terror. the kings son stayed sitting quite quietly and was not afraid but at last the devils jumped up from the ground and fell on him and there were so many of them that he could not defend himself from them. and now he had only one night more to go through but it was the worst. but suddenly he was freed from all pain and felt fresh and healthy as if he had awakened from sleep and when he opened his eyes he saw the maiden standing by him snowwhite and fair as day. the servants came and said that the table was already set in the great hall and dinner served up. then the huntsman did as the old woman had directed him cut open the bird sought the heart swallowed it down and took the cloak home with him. next morning when he awoke the promise occurred to him and he wished to see if it also had been fulfilled. when he lifted up the pillow the gold piece shone in his eyes and next day he found another and so it went on every time he got up. it came to pass that one day he travelled through a dense forest and when he came to the end of it in the plain before him stood a fine castle. an old woman was standing with a wonderfully beautiful maiden looking out of one of the windows. before long he was so much in love with the young witch that he no longer thought of anything else and only saw things as she saw them and did what she desired. the girl had to take it away secretly and swallow it herself for the old woman would have it so. so she did the old womans bidding placed herself at the window and looked on the distant country as if she were very sorrowful. i long for them so much that when i think of them i feel quite sad but who can get them but the huntsman had paid heed to their words and as soon as they were gone he rose and climbed up to the summit of the mountain and when he had sat there a while a cloud floated towards him caught him up carried him away and travelled about for a long time in the heavens. four legs grew on him a large head and two thick ears and he saw with horror that he was changed into an ass. after wandering about for a couple of days he was lucky enough to find it again. he knocked at the window the miller put out his head and asked what he wanted. all perished together except the girl who had jumped out of the carriage in a fright and hidden herself behind a tree. when it was evening she seated herself under a tree gave herself into gods keeping and resolved to sit waiting there and not go away let what might happen. when however she had sat there for a while a white dove came flying to her with a little golden key in its mouth. so she lived there for some time and the dove came every day and provided her with all she needed and it was a quiet good life. she turned them over and looked for the plain one but could not find it. so she went after her and took the cage out of her hand and when she raised it up and looked into it a bird was inside which had the plain ring in its bill. and he led them forth to his kingdom for he was a kings son and they married and lived happily. they fixed a time when they should all come home again and then each went his way. as they were sitting thus all at once a hare came running across the field. and because they had been so clever and had loved one another so much they were all laid in the same grave. they stayed in the corn for two days and two nights and were so hungry that they all but died but if they had come out their death would have been certain. then the dragon caught hold of them with his claws and carried them away through the air over the army and put them down again on the earth far from it but the dragon was no other than the devil. then an aged woman came up to them who inquired why they were so sad in the little house however a very aged woman was sitting who was the devils grandmother and asked the soldier where he came from and what he wanted there he told her everything that had happened and as he pleased her well she had pity on him and said she would help him. the grandmother laid the table and served up food and drink so that he was pleased and they ate and drank together. in the course of conversation she asked him what kind of a day he had had and how many souls he had got there you shall have a meal as he went a poor man met him who asked him where he was going. after seven years more when he was fourteen years old he again went thither and there stood the castle. when he had opened it there was nothing within but a horse a white one. then the boy was so full of joy because he had a horse that he mounted on it and galloped back to his father. so he set out and as he was on his way a pen was lying on the road. he answered he could not very well go to any one like that and offer himself. if he will give thee a ship full of meat and a ship full of bread it will succeed. then go up to the castle and take a couple of giants with thee. so it happened again as it had happened before and the giants and the birds were satisfied and made gentle by the meat. but she cut off his head and did not put it on again but pretended that she could not get it on and that it would not keep fixed. and when he had done that the white horse stood up on its hind legs and was changed into a kings son. there he passed many years and no one could deliver him. then a kings daughter came into the forest who had lost herself and could not find her fathers kingdom again. after she had wandered about for nine days she at length came to the iron stove. they therefore resolved they would send in her place the millers daughter who was very beautiful. she however made nothing of it. so she took leave of her father put a knife in her pocket and went forth to the iron stove in the forest. then she peeped in and saw a youth so handsome and so brilliant with gold and with precious jewels that her very soul was delighted. after this she bade goodbye to her father took some money with her but not much and went back to the great forest and looked for the iron stove but it was nowhere to be found. for nine days she sought it and then her hunger grew so great that she did not know what to do for she could no longer live. when it was evening she seated herself in a small tree and made up her mind to spend the night there as she was afraid of wild beasts. then she came to a little old house and much grass had grown all about it and a small heap of wood lay in front of it. then she took courage and knocked at the door. when she entered they all bade her welcome and she was forced to sit down. if she did all this she would get her lover back again. at last she arrived in front of a great lake and when she had crossed it she came to a large and beautiful castle. she went and asked for a place she was a poor girl she said and would like to be hired. she knew however that the kings son whom she had released from the iron stove in the great forest was in the castle. but already the kings son had another maiden by his side whom he wanted to marry for he thought that she had long been dead. in the evening when she had washed up and was done she felt in her pocket and found the three nuts which the old toad had given her. the bride gave her permission because the dress was so pretty and she had never had one like it. and the next evening when she had washed up she opened the second nut and a far more beautiful dress was within it and when the bride beheld it she wished to buy that also. but the girl would not take money and begged that she might once again sleep in the bridegrooms chamber. and on the third evening when she had washed up she opened the third nut and within it was a still more beautiful dress which was stiff with pure gold. when the bride saw that she wanted to have it but the maiden only gave it up on condition that she might for the third time sleep in the bridegrooms apartment. a mouse did run this story is done. but when a few moments had passed he took heart again and a third time he stretched out his hand for the axe and began to cut. he got up as quickly as he could and went into the kitchen. the second brother met a man who put the same question to him what he wanted to learn in the world. he certainly must have had some of the powder for shooting round corners. when he had done this the thief had to climb up the tree again and carry them to the nest and put them back again under the bird without her being aware of it. there the kings daughter was sitting and the dragon was lying asleep on her lap. however as twoeyes saw just as other human beings did her sisters and her mother could not endure her. i watched everything closely. they both took great trouble but they were not able to do it for the branches and fruit both moved away from them every time. when the knight saw the apples he was astonished and asked where they came from. and when twoeyes looked out of the window of her own little room to her great delight it was standing in front of it and so it had followed her. twoeyes lived a long time in happiness. the horse was sad and went to the forest to seek a little protection there from the weather. but the fox tied the lions legs together with the horses tail and twisted and fastened all so well and so strongly that no strength could break it. the lion began to roar so that all the birds in the forest flew out in terror but the horse let him roar and drew him and dragged him over the country to his masters door. his bed was placed there and he was to observe where they went and danced and in order that they might do nothing secretly or go away to some other place the door of their room was left open. on the second and third nights it fell out just the same and then his head was struck off without mercy. now it came to pass that a poor soldier who had a wound and could serve no longer found himself on the road to the town where the king lived. there he met an old woman who asked him where he was going. he was as well received as the others and royal garments were put upon him. the youngest cried out again. on the shore they took leave of their princes and promised to return the following night. then everything was done just as it had been done the first time and each time they danced until their shoes were worn to pieces. but the third time he took a cup away with him as a token. when the hour had arrived for him to give his answer he took the three twigs and the cup and went to the king but the twelve stood behind the door and listened for what he was going to say. thereupon the king asked which of them he would have to wife but the princes were bewitched for as many days as they had danced nights with the twelve. when they had walked on for a great distance they came to the body and at last to the head also. a ring is to be got out of the red sea. the tall one stooped down a little and brought out the ring with his hand. then the kings son rejoiced when he had the ring and took it to the old queen. thou hast safely performed the first task but now comes the second. dost thou see the meadow in front of my palace when the meal was over the prince went to the old woman and told her that the second task also was performed. there the two sat and the maiden spake never a word but the moon shone through the window on her face and the prince could behold her wondrous beauty. he did nothing but gaze at her and was filled with love and happiness and his eyes never felt weary. she thought that none of his servants would let themselves be burnt for him and that out of love for her he himself would place himself upon it and then she would be free. and now came a couple of people who asked if she knew who her husband was. every day he went and stood before the picture and thanked god for the happiness of having such a dear sister. the attendants about the court however remarked that the coachman stood daily before this beautiful picture and they were jealous of him so they informed the king. he caused the coachman to be brought before him and asked whom the portrait represented the coachman said it was his sister so the king resolved to take no one but her as his wife and gave him a carriage and horses and splendid garments of cloth of gold and sent him forth to fetch his chosen bride. and they drove on farther. the brother had observed nothing of it and drove the carriage on until they reached the court. then he took the black maiden to the king as his sister and thought she really was so because his eyes were dim and he saw the golden garments glittering. the next night she came again and put the same questions and the third night also. the king however wanted to see it for himself and next evening went thither and when the duck thrust her head in through the sink he took his sword and cut through her neck and suddenly she changed into a most beautiful maiden exactly like the picture which her brother had made of her. and related what had happened. but the king married the white and beautiful bride and rewarded her faithful brother and made him a rich and distinguished man. this lasted for many years when a strange huntsman announced himself to the king as seeking a situation and offered to go into the dangerous forest. when they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees. and from this time forth every one could again go into the forest with safety. when it was open the wild man stepped out gave him the golden ball and hurried away. when the king came home he observed the empty cage and asked the queen how that had happened she knew nothing about it and sought the key but it was gone. she called the boy but no one answered. the king sent out people to seek for him in the fields but they did not find him. then he could easily guess what had happened and much grief reigned in the royal court. if thou dost all i bid thee thou shalt fare well. he drew it quickly out again but saw that it was quite gilded and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold off again all was to no purpose. he took it quickly out but it was already quite gilded. iron john came and already knew what had happened. but the time was long to him and he looked at the reflection of his face on the surface of the water. and as he still bent down more and more while he was doing so and trying to look straight into the eyes his long hair fell down from his shoulders into the water. he raised himself up quickly but the whole of the hair of his head was already golden and shone like the sun. you may imagine how terrified the poor boy was go forth into the world there thou wilt learn what poverty is. there he looked for work but could find none and he had learnt nothing by which he could help himself. at length he went to the palace and asked if they would take him in. the people about court did not at all know what use they could make of him but they liked him and told him to stay. once when it so happened that no one else was at hand the cook ordered him to carry the food to the royal table but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen he kept his little cap on. the cook however had pity on him and exchanged him for the gardeners boy. once in summer when he was working alone in the garden the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air might cool him. with these he departed but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. on the third day things went just the same she could not get his cap away from him and he would not have her money. they began to fly but the youth pursued and never stopped until there was not a single man left. when the king returned to his palace his daughter went to meet him and wished him joy of his victory. the kings daughter came forward and threw a golden apple to the knights but none of them caught it but he only as soon as he had it he galloped away. but when he was riding off with it the kings attendants pursued him and one of them got so near him that he wounded the youths leg with the point of his sword. they rode back and announced this to the king. the following day the kings daughter asked the gardener about his boy. but the kings daughter went up to him and took it off and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders and he was so handsome that all were amazed. his father and mother came to the wedding and were in great delight for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear son again. the son got away again from the enemy and came to a great forest on a high mountain. then came three young princesses who were entirely dressed in black but had a little white on their faces they told him he was not to be afraid they would not hurt him and that he could deliver them. he said he would gladly do that if he did but know how. at this they told him he must for a whole year not speak to them and also not look at them and what he wanted to have he was just to ask for and if they dared give him an answer they would do so. when he had been there for a long while he said he should like to go to his father and they told him he might go. he was to take with him this purse with money put on this coat and in a week he must be back there again. then he was caught up and was instantly in east india. he could no longer find his father in the fishermans hut and asked the people where the poor fisherman could be and they told him he must not say that or he would come to the gallows. am i not the son of the poor fisherman and they had told him not to fear and that he could deliver them. now there is no man born in the world nor will any ever be born who can set us free once on a time they went into a field and there they saw a hare. the blind one shot it the lame one caught it the naked one put it in his pocket. then they came to a mighty big lake on which there were three boats one sailed one sank the third had no bottom to it. they all three got into the one with no bottom to it. help me soon to a man. their own mother was however dead and they had a stepmother who was not kind to them and secretly did everything she could to hurt them. it so happened that the two were playing with other children in a meadow before the house and there was a pond in the meadow which came up to one side of the house. the children ran about it and caught each other and played at counting out. the little bird it straw shall seek the straw ill give to the cow to eat. the pretty cow shall give me milk the milk ill to the baker take. the baker he shall bake a cake the cake ill give unto the cat. as they were running about so merrily the stepmother watched them from the window and grew angry. thus passed a long time and then strangers came as visitors to the castle. when they were quite out of sight the poor man got down from the tree and was curious to know what really was secretly hidden in the mountain. the poor man hardly knew what to do and whether he might take any of these treasures for himself or not but at last he filled his pockets with gold but he left the pearls and precious stones where they were. and now he had no more cause for anxiety but could buy bread for his wife and children with his gold and wine into the bargain. when for the third time he wanted to fetch something he again borrowed the measure of his brother. then he thought of a cunning trick and covered the bottom of the measure with pitch and when he got the measure back a piece of money was sticking in it. the poor man then told him everything just as it happened. the rich man however ordered his carriage to be made ready and drove away resolved to use the opportunity better than his brother had done and to bring back with him quite different treasures. at length he loaded himself with as many precious stones as he could carry. then he was alarmed but the longer he thought about it the more his thoughts confused themselves and his treasures were no more of any use to him. he was so distressed about it that he went out into the wide world and only took with him one faithful companion. they travelled up and down and at last they came into a kingdom where an old king reigned who had an only but wonderfully beautiful daughter. and now the donkey was asked to sit down and eat with the servants. so a great and splendid wedding was held. when morning came he jumped up put his animals skin on again and no one could have guessed what kind of a form was hidden beneath it. so he took it away and had a great fire lighted outside and threw the skin into it and remained by it himself until it was all burnt to ashes. as however he was anxious to know how the robbed man would behave himself he stayed awake the whole night and watched. when the youth had slept his sleep out he got up by the first light of morning and wanted to put on the asss skin but it was not to be found. what hast thou in mind stay here thou art such a handsome man thou shalt not go away from me. then the man saw that his aged father was coming and hastily took the chicken and hid it for he would not permit him to have any of it. the old man came took a drink and went away. then the poor one to escape from his poverty put off his soldiers coat and turned farmer. he would however set about it in a much wiser way and took gold and horses and carried them to the king and made certain the king would give him a much larger present in return. but just as they were doing this loud singing and the sound of a horses feet were heard in the distance. on this their hearts were filled with terror and they pushed their prisoner head first into the sack hung it on a branch and took to flight. he however worked up there until he had made a hole in the sack through which he could put his head. the smith who had watched everything closely and attentively invited them all to supper. this enraged him at last and he went and bit off the tail of every goat as may be seen to this day by the stump. this distressed him so that in his goodness and mercy he summoned his wolves who soon tore in pieces the goats that went there. the boy stood and saw that but he ought to have put the flames out. is it not true that he ought to have put them out the care of my body is my principal work i eat not a little and drink still more. when i have had four meals i fast a short time until i feel hunger again and that suits me best. if the master call i do exactly as if i had not heard him and if he call for the second time i wait awhile before i get up and go to him very slowly. who is going to make a great business of that nothing comes of it i laid myself in the sun and fell asleep. it began to rain a little but why should i get up i let it rain on in gods name. after that i begin quite slowly and ask if no one is there who could help me. i came where six men were lying sleeping on a bed beside each other. i lay down by them and slept too. i lay myself down on the ground and if i am wet and covered with mud and dirt i stay lying until the sun has dried me again. today the bread was before me but i was too idle to take it and nearly died of hunger moreover a jug stood by it but it was so big and heavy that i did not like to lift it up and preferred bearing thirst. three of us were lying in the road and i had my legs stretched out. some one came with a cart and the wheels went over me. there was no end of it all day long. some one had come by who had carried all off. i left it standing and stretched myself on the straw again. the king of the country heard of it likewise but did not believe it and sent for the boy. then she gave it her own and a little farther on one begged for a frock and she gave away that also. and as she so stood and had not one single thing left suddenly some stars from heaven fell down and they were nothing else but hard smooth pieces of money and although she had just given her little shirt away she had a new one which was of the very finest linen. then she gathered together the money into this and was rich all the days of her life. and as they thus sat and it was striking twelve oclock the stranger saw the door open and a very pale child dressed in snowwhite clothes came in. it did not look around and it did not speak but went straight into the next room. soon afterwards it came back and went out at the door again in the same quiet manner. on the second and on the third day it came also exactly in the same way. at last the stranger asked the father to whom the beautiful child that went into the next room every day at noon belonged the next day when it again came the stranger pointed it out to the father who however did not see it and the mother and the children also all saw nothing. on this the stranger got up went to the room door opened it a little and peeped in. the parents gave the money at once to a poor man and after that the child was never seen again. then she told him that the girl was wearing a dress make of the flax which she had thrown away. when the bridegroom heard that and saw how idle she was and how industrious the poor girl was he gave her up and went to the other and chose her as his wife. have i not told enough lies then a snail came running up and killed two furious lions. do you want to know how it was done first the blind man saw the hare running across the field the dumb one called to the lame one and the lame one seized it by the neck. there were certain men who wished to sail on dry land and they set their sails in the wind and sailed away over great fields. a crab was chasing a hare which was running away at full speed and high up on the roof lay a cow which had climbed up there. in that country the flies are as big as the goats are here. open the window that the lies may fly out. now the question is how did her husband know her for the flowers were exactly alike and without any difference once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused them they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near their bed. he got up and looked quite kindly at them but said nothing and went away into the forest. the kettle was of copper and shone like gold so brightly was it polished. one evening as they were thus sitting comfortably together some one knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. it was not long before they grew quite at home and played tricks with their clumsy guest. henceforth the bear came every evening at the same time laid himself down by the hearth and let the children amuse themselves with him as much as they liked and they got so used to him that the doors were never fastened until their black friend had arrived. the bear ran away quickly and was soon out of sight behind the trees. when they came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a snowwhite beard a yard long. the little bit of food that one of us wants gets burnt up directly with thick logs we do not swallow so much as you coarse greedy folk. they ran to it and found it was the dwarf. now you have cut off the best part of it. i cannot let myself be seen by my people. they ran up and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance the dwarf and was going to carry him off. the dwarf sprang up in a fright but he could not get to his cave for the bear was already close. grant me my life what do you want with such a slender little fellow as i you would not feel me between your teeth. a clever john of this kind was once sent out by his master to seek a lost cow. he had to search a long time but at last he perceived the boy who was running up and down a large field. night fell and nothing was left for him to do but to seek a bed in this painful solitude. he might certainly have found a good bed on the soft moss but the fear of wild beasts let him have no rest there and at last he was forced to make up his mind to spend the night in a tree. he sought out a high oak climbed up to the top of it and thanked god that he had his goose with him for otherwise the wind which blew over the top of the tree would have carried him away. a violent sound of screaming and roaring forced its way through the thin walls of the hut. then close by the hut he saw a great black bull and a beautiful stag which were just preparing for a violent struggle. he had not much time to collect his thoughts for it went in a swift race over stock and stone mountain and valley wood and meadow. it seemed however to him just as if he were flying away. at length the stag stopped in front of a wall of rock and gently let the tailor down. the tailor more dead than alive required a longer time than that to come to himself. when he had in some degree recovered the stag which had remained standing by him pushed its horns with such force against a door which was in the rock that it sprang open. flames of fire shot forth after which followed a great smoke which hid the stag from his sight. the tailor did not know what to do or whither to turn in order to get out of this desert and back to human beings again. the stone began to give way under his feet and sank slowly down into the depths. when it was once more firm and the tailor looked round he found himself in a hall which in size resembled the former. here however there was more to look at and to admire. it ordered him to turn round and look at the glass chest which was standing opposite. she lay as if asleep and was wrapped in her long fair hair as in a precious mantle. the tailor was looking at the beauty with beating heart when she suddenly opened her eyes and started up at the sight of him in joyful terror. in our house there was no lack of company neighbors and friends visited us often and we showed the greatest hospitality to every one. my brother liked the stranger so much that he begged him to spend a couple of days with us to which after some hesitation he consented. we did not rise from table until late in the night the stranger was shown to room and i hastened as i was tired to lay my limbs in my soft bed. hardly had i slept for a short time when the sound of faint and delightful music awoke me. the servant fell with his horse and could not follow me for the horse had broken its foot. i asked him where he had left my brother and how he had come by this stag out of whose great eyes i saw tears flowing. instead of answering me he began to laugh loudly. i answered him as little as i had done the first time. he vanished and left me in my prison in which a deep sleep came on me. after this the maiden and the tailor returned to the cave beneath the earth and had the vessels which were filled with smoke carried up by the stone. the maiden had scarcely opened the bottles when the blue smoke rushed out and changed itself into living men in whom she recognized her servants and her people. lazy harry did not like to leave his bed before noon. but it is lucky that the pitcher did not fall on my head. he had no son but an only daughter who had always been ill and no doctor had been able to cure her. when he opened the basket instead of having apples in it he had frogs legs which were still kicking about. on this the king grew angry and had him driven out of the house. he also met the little iron man who asked what he had there in the basket. at length they believed him and led him to the king. when he got home he related all that had befallen him then the youngest boy whose name was hans but who was always called stupid hans came and asked his father if he might go with some apples. hans however did not care about that and did not let it spoil his pleasure but as it was then night he thought he might as well wait until the morrow for he could not get to court that day. hans gave him the answer that he was carrying apples with which the kings daughter was to eat herself well. the king was delighted and caused some of them to be taken to his daughter and then waited in anxious expectation until news should be brought to him of the effect they had. but before much time had passed by news was brought to him but who do you think it was who came it was his daughter herself the joy the king felt cannot be described on the third day stupid hans went. the boat went as swiftly as the wind. hans was contented with this and the next day went with his flock to the pasture and took great care that none of them ran away. hans however was very well aware what that meant and said he would not give her one the king might set some hare soup before his guest next day. then hans said that if the kings daughter came herself he would give her a hare. the maid told this in the palace and the daughter did go herself. in the meantime however the little man came again to hans and asked him what he was doing there hans set out at once and walked straight forwards. the lord of the castle promised him that with much pleasure and asked where he was going to the griffin when the people who lived there learnt that he was going to the griffin they said they had in the house a daughter who was ill and that they had already tried every means to cure her but none of them had done her any good and he might be so kind as to ask the griffin what would make their daughter healthy again hans said he would willingly do that and went onwards. then the man took him up on his shoulders and carried him across. at length hans arrived at the griffins house but the wife only was at home and not the griffin himself. then the woman asked him what he wanted the griffins wife repeated it all once more to him that he might not forget it and then he went home again. first he came to the man by the lake who asked him what the griffin had said but hans replied that he must first carry him across and then he would tell him. so the man carried him across and when he was over hans told him that all he had to do was to set one person down in the middle of the lake and then he would never have to carry over any more. but hans said no he would save him the trouble he was quite satisfied already and pursued his way. then were the father and mother beyond measure rejoiced and they gave hans gifts of gold and of silver and whatsoever else he wished for that they gave him. he also was not a little pleased and gave hans as a reward much of the gold that was in the chest and all kinds of things besides such as cows and sheep and goats. then hans told him that the griffin gave every one whatsoever he wanted. so the king thought he himself could make such things useful and set out on his way to the griffin but when he got to the lake it happened that he was the very first who arrived there after hans and the man put him down in the middle of it and went away and the king was drowned. hans however married the daughter and became king. it came to pass that the mother once went into the wood to gather branches of fir and took with her little hans who was just two years old. suddenly two robbers sprang out of the thicket seized the mother and child and carried them far away into the black forest where no one ever came from one years end to another. they had to go through a long dark passage and at last came into a great cavern which was lighted by a fire which burnt on the hearth. thereupon they gave her something to eat and showed her a bed where she might sleep with her child. the woman stayed many years with the robbers and hans grew tall and strong. his mother told him stories and taught him to read an old book of tales about knights which she found in the cave. then hans brought out his club placed himself before the captain and asked him who was his father they left the cave but how hans did open his eyes when he came out of the darkness into daylight and saw the green forest and the flowers and the birds and the morning sun in the sky. he stood there and wondered at everything just as if he had not been very wise. his mother looked for the way home and when they had walked for a couple of hours they got safely into their lonely valley and to their little house. the father was sitting in the doorway. he wept for joy when he recognized his wife and heard that hans was his son for he had long regarded them both as dead. they went into the little room together but hans had scarcely put his sack on the bench by the stove than the whole house began to crack the bench broke down and then the floor and the heavy sack fell through into the cellar. shortly afterwards they came to a mighty rock before which a giant was standing and striking great pieces of it away with his fist. in the evening they came to an old deserted castle went up into it and laid themselves down in the hall to sleep. the next morning hans went into the garden. and as he was thus walking round about a wild boar rushed at him he however gave it such a blow with his club that it fell directly. then they arranged that each day in turn two should go out hunting and one should stay at home and cook nine pounds of meat for each of them. when the dwarf had devoured it he again asked for some meat and goodnatured hans gave it to him and told him it was a handsome piece and that he was to be content with it. but the dwarf begged again for the third time. hans was about to run after him but fell right over him for he was so tall. when he rose up again the dwarf had got the start of him. hans hurried after him as far as the forest and saw him slip into a hole in the rock. hans now went home but he had marked the spot. when the two others came back they were surprised that hans was so well. but now he did not know how he was to work his way out of the depths and when he turned it over and over in his mind he found no counsel. hans was at first struck dumb but afterwards he said that they were to carry him above again. they obeyed instantly and it was just as if he had flown up himself. when however he was above again he found no one in sight. but hans turned the ring and the spirits of the air came and told him that the two were on the sea. at the same time a very rich rich lord came there who also wanted to get into heaven. then saint peter came with the key and opened the door and let the great man in but apparently did not see the peasant and shut the door again. and now the peasant outside heard how the great man was received in heaven with all kinds of rejoicing and how they were making music and singing within. at length all became quiet again and saint peter came and opened the gate of heaven and let the peasant in. the peasant however expected that they would make music and sing when he went in also but all remained quite quiet he was received with great affection it is true and the angels came to meet him but no one sang. it was however all to no purpose they had nothing and came to nothing. it was not long before she came to a house the windows of which were all lighted up. the girl told her story to the old man and begged for shelter for the night. the birds of the forest had picked them up as they had done the day before and had left none. the girl wandered about in the forest until night and then she too reached the house of the old man was told to go in and begged for food and a bed. at length when it grew dark she saw the light and came to the house in the forest. when the animals were fed the girl seated herself at the table by the old man and ate what he had left. the girl lay down on the other said her prayers and fell asleep. she slept quietly till midnight and then there was such a noise in the house that she awoke. as however all grew quiet once more and the girl was not hurt she stayed quietly lying where she was and fell asleep again. he was kept for a while on bread and water and then set free again. he was forced however to promise not to beat his wife any more but to live with her in peace and share joy and sorrow with her as married people ought to do. and because he dared not beat her he would seize her by the hair and tear it out. this went on so long that the neighbors came to the wifes assistance. it came into the birds mind however that they would no longer be without a ruler and would choose one of themselves to be their king. it was decided however that the one who could fly the highest should be king. the little birds were however soon left behind. they could go no farther and fell back to the ground. the larger birds held out longer but none could equal the eagle who mounted so high that he could have picked the eyes out of the sun. the birds beneath him at once cried to him. and as he was not at all tired he rose up and mounted so high that he reached heaven itself. how quickly the cock scratched a hole the little fellow put his head out and peeped and wanted to slip away but the owl came forward immediately and he drew his head back again. then the owl opened the one eye again and shut the other intending to shut them in turn all through the night. but when she next shut the one eye she forgot to open the other and as soon as both her eyes were shut she fell asleep. the little fellow soon observed that and slipped away. from that day forth the owl has never dared to show herself by daylight for if she does the other birds chase her and pluck her feathers out. the little bird too is very unwilling to let himself be seen because he is afraid it will cost him his life if he is caught. no one however was so happy as the lark at not having to obey the little king. beautiful that is beautiful beautiful when however he saw the strange grim creature with his own eyes he was no less terrified than the servant had been. all praised his courage though many feared for his life. and now there was no one left who dared to put himself in such danger. let any one who will not believe it go thither and inquire for himself. by means of this everything could very well be seen and distinguished even though it was not so brilliant as the sun. he has to pour oil into it daily and to keep it clean so that it may always burn clearly. they rose up and were merry and fell into their former ways of living. the noise became greater and greater and at last reached even to heaven. as these however did not come he got on his horse and rode through the gate of heaven down into the world below. think of my painful existence the ass went away comforted and the dog appeared. then came the monkey. the first thirty are his human years which are soon gone then is he healthy merry works with pleasure and is glad of his life. it was a long violent battle at last the giant got the upper hand and struck death down with his fist so that he dropped by a stone. did not thine ears sing was it not dark before thine eyes and besides all that has not my own brother sleep reminded thee every night of me the man could make no answer he yielded to his fate and went away with death. he himself did not turn much work out of his hands for he never sat still for a quarter of an hour. that is a fire one could roast an ox by someone was building a new house so he hurried to the window to look on. and just look how badly the fellows are laying the stones besides the mortar is good for nothing who would buy a shoe like this which is hardly anything else but a sole when you jumped up a while since you knocked it off the table and i have only just picked it up. when he got there he knocked loudly at the door. he looked around him to the left and to the right but sometimes shook his head or muttered something to himself. has any one ever since the world began seen a cart drawn in that way it is besides great folly to fix a pair of wings to a horse that has four legs to run with already there however the dame was quite active more so than any one would have thought considering her age and collected grass for her geese picked all the wild fruit she could reach and carried everything home on her back. any one would have thought that the heavy load would have weighed her to the ground but she always brought it safely home. ah you are ready with fine words but when it comes to be earnest you want to take to your heels. he turned and twisted but he could not get rid of it. carry your bundle patiently. when he was already some way off he still heard in the distance the noisy cry of the geese. for three days the count had to wander in the wilderness before he could find his way out. he then reached a large town and as no one knew him he was led into the royal palace where the king and queen were sitting on their throne. the count fell on one knee drew the emerald book out of his pocket and laid it at the queens feet. she bade him rise and hand her the little book. the count was seized by the kings servants and was being led to prison when the queen opened her eyes and ordered them to release him and every one was to go out as she wished to speak with him in private. i had three daughters the youngest of whom was so beautiful that the whole world looked on her as a wonder. when she cried not tears fell from her eyes but pearls and jewels only. when she was fifteen years old the king summoned all three sisters to come before his throne. you should have seen how all the people gazed when the youngest entered it was just as if the sun were rising how she cried when she had to leave us the king and the queen resolved to seek out the old woman. they thought that there where the pearl had been they would obtain news of their daughter. soon afterwards the daughter also entered. but the old woman scarcely thanked her and only shook her head a little. thus they both sat for two hours and exchanged never a word. over the meadows ever onward into the valley. she removed a skin which covered her face then bent down to the well and began to wash herself. but how the maiden was changed such a change as that was never seen before but the fair maiden was sad. she sat down and wept bitterly. one tear after another forced itself out of her eyes and rolled through her long hair to the ground. dear mother will you cast me off where shall i go i have no friends and no home to which i can go. next day it seemed to him that he was on the right track. he still went forward until darkness came on then he climbed a tree intending to pass the night there for he feared that he might lose his way. he hardly dared to breathe but stretched his head as far forward through the leaves as he dared and stared at her. he had not been gone long before he saw in the twilight two figures coming over the meadow. it was the king and queen who had perceived from a distance the light shining in the old womans little house and were going to it. the count told them what wonderful things he had seen by the well and they did not doubt that it had been their lost daughter. they walked onwards full of joy and soon came to the little house. the geese were sitting all round it and had thrust their heads under their wings and were sleeping and not one of them moved. the king and queen looked in at the window the old woman was sitting there quite quietly spinning nodding her head and never looking round. the room was perfectly clean as if the little mist men who carry no dust on their feet lived there. their daughter however they did not see. they gazed at all this for a long time at last they took heart and knocked softly at the window. she went up to her father and mother fell on their necks and kissed them there was no help for it they all had to weep for joy. the walls rattled a little and when the king and queen looked round the little house had changed into a splendid palace a royal table had been spread and the servants were running hither and thither. the story goes still further but my grandmother who related it to me had partly lost her memory and had forgotten the rest. this much is certain that the old woman was no witch as people thought but a wise woman who meant well. very likely it was she who at the princesss birth gave her the gift of weeping pearls instead of tears. every year eve brought a child into the world but the children were unlike each other some pretty and some ugly. then she brought in her children but only the beautiful ones. the ugly children were however not to let themselves be seen. there in a row stood the pretty children and bowed before him held out their hands and knelt down. he was in great distress and when he lay down after his days work found no rest but tossed about in his bed full of care. he turned round and perceived a beautiful woman rising slowly out of the water. her long hair which she was holding off her shoulders with her soft hands fell down on both sides and covered her white body. the miller was at first struck dumb but when he heard her speak so kindly he took heart and told her how he had formerly lived in wealth and happiness but that now he was so poor that he did not know what to do. it was not long before his wealth was greater than it had ever been before. he never let the boy himself go near the water. when he had learnt everything and had become an excellent huntsman the lord of the village took him into his service. when it was evening and the huntsman did not return home his wife became alarmed. the poor woman did not leave the pond. at last her strength came to an end she sank down to the ground and fell into a heavy sleep. presently a dream took possession of her. the old woman received her kindly and pointed out a chair on which she might sit. here is a golden comb for thee. it was not long before there was a movement in the depths a wave rose rolled to the shore and bore the comb away with it. in not more than the time necessary for the comb to sink to the bottom the surface of the water parted and the head of the huntsman arose. he did not speak but looked at his wife with sorrowful glances. at the same instant a second wave came rushing up and covered the mans head. full of sorrow the woman went back but again the dream showed her the cottage of the old woman. immediately afterwards the water parted and not only the head of the man but half of his body also arose. no sooner was the wheel standing on the shore than there was a more violent movement than before in the depths of the pond and a mighty wave rushed up and bore the wheel away with it. he quickly sprang to the shore caught his wife by the hand and fled. they met in a valley but did not recognize each other yet they rejoiced that they were no longer so lonely. they embraced and kissed each other and no one need ask if they were happy. the two remained standing full of astonishment and watched the dance. the old man made a sign that they should enter and the little folks willingly opened their circle. but their fear left them when after he had finished his work the old man clapped them both on the shoulder in a friendly manner as much as to say they had behaved well to let all that be done to them willingly and without any struggle. both of them obeyed although they did not know of what use the coals would be to them and then they went on their way to seek a shelter for the night. in a moment all had vanished and the hill lay in solitude in the moonlight. a heavy weight on their limbs awakened them earlier than usual. a greedy man even if he has much still wishes to have more so the goldsmith proposed to the tailor that they should wait another day and go out again in the evening in order to bring back still greater treasures from the old man on the hill. he was not slow about sticking as much into his bags as would go went back quite delighted and covered himself over with his coat. once when he was out he perceived in the blue distance a steep hill and behind it a tower reaching to the clouds which rose up out of a wild dark forest. but what made the tailor open his eyes and mouth when he came near it was to see that the tower had legs and leapt in one bound over the steep hill and was now standing as an all powerful giant before him. time brings counsel. when however he was compelled to draw breath it hurried him for unfortunately he had not put his goose in his pocket so high into the air that he never was seen again and this to the great delight of the giant. so he packed his trunk with the money on his horse and rode away. and there he did not arrive until quite late at night. the man and his wife had however bad hearts and were greedy and anxious about their riches and vexed whenever any one put a morsel of their bread in his mouth. the poor young fellow might do what he liked he got little to eat but only so many blows the more. thief but what good did that do the man heard the noise and ran to the spot and as soon as he saw that his hen was gone he fell in a rage and gave the boy such a beating that he could not stir for two days. then he had to take care of the chickens without the hen but now his difficulty was greater for one ran here and the other there. but he was very much mistaken. after two days worn out with running about and hunger he fell asleep the bird of prey came and seized one of the chickens and as the others were tied fast to it it carried them all off together perched itself on a tree and devoured them. the judge wrote a letter to the farmer and asked for the same number of grapes again. these also the boy had to take to him with a letter. the boy seated himself on the bench and began to work with all his might. as he got warm over it he put his little coat off and threw it on the straw. the boy crept under the bed brought out the pot and ate all that was in it. he lost his senses more and more. in the neighbourhood was an inn where a wedding was being kept when he heard the music he fancied he was already in paradise until at length he lost all consciousness. his wife who was standing on the hearth with a pan of hot fat ran to him to help him. still she could not touch the heart of the wicked woman by that she was never satisfied it was never enough. she set to work at once knelt down by the water into which her tears were falling and began to empty it. she went to her stepmother and showed her that the work was done. she sat down and wept and still she hoped the old woman would help her. the inside of the castle was being finished while evening was drawing near. the sun was just setting when the girl awoke and the brightness of a thousand lights flashed in her face. she hurried to the castle and entered by the open door. who knows how long she might have stood there if she had not remembered the stepmother and now the magnificent castle belonged to the girl alone. and soon the fame of the beauty and riches of the maiden went over all the world. she sat three days from morning till evening waiting for him but in vain. far and wide did she wander through the world but she found him not. the road to the town passed through the village where the maiden was living and it came to pass that once when the maiden was driving out her herd her bridegroom travelled by. he looked into the herds face and then put his hands before his eyes as if he were trying to remember something but he soon rode onwards and was out of sight. soon after this a great festival three days long was to be held at the kings court and the whole country was invited to it. she let down her hair which she had concealed under a handkerchief and it fell down in long curls about her and thus she went into the town and in the darkness was observed by no one. the kings son went to meet her but he did not recognize her. he led her out to dance and was so enchanted with her beauty that he thought no more of the other bride. when she appeared at the festival all eyes were turned upon her but the kings son hastened to meet her and filled with love for her danced with her alone and no longer so much as glanced at anyone else. before she went away she was forced to promise him to come again to the festival on the last evening. the prince had already been waiting for her for a long time and forced his way up to her. no sooner said than done. when the hedgehog caught sight of the hare he bade him a friendly good morning. she was forced to obey him whether she liked it or not. when he reached the top the hare was already there. but the hedgehogs wife stayed quietly in her place. so whosoever is a hedgehog let him see to it that his wife is a hedgehog also and so forth. about this time the son of the king was travelling about the country looking for a bride. he was not to choose a poor one and did not want to have a rich one. he looked at her said nothing and rode on. when he came to the house of the poor girl she was not standing at the door but sitting in her little room. she looked up and when she saw that the prince was looking in she blushed all over her face let her eyes fall and went on spinning. before long it had entirely vanished from her sight. he alighted stepped over the carpet into the house and when he entered the room there stood the maiden in her poor garments but she shone out from within them like a rose surrounded by leaves. the best story is however how he once got hold of the devil and made a fool of him. the peasant had one day been working in his field and as twilight had set in was making ready for the journey home when he saw a heap of burning coals in the middle of his field and when full of astonishment he went up to it a little black devil was sitting on the live coals. but at that very moment the mistress came and seized the stick in great haste and beat them and treated them very hardly. he who tried this however and was discovered by her was to have his head struck off and stuck on a post. then he seized his gun and went out hunting. she ordered the raven to be shot and the egg to be brought and broken and the youth was forced to come out. she ordered the fish to be caught and killed and then the youth appeared. every one can imagine what a state of mind he was in. the merchant went into the town and showed the pretty little animal and many persons gathered together to see it. at length the kings daughter came likewise and as she liked it very much she bought it and gave the merchant a good deal of money for it. the peasant stood up went to the great man and asked what he wanted and in what way he could be useful to him how have i got all that poor people are safe i would rather give to them than take anything from them. when however the stranger made himself known the count turned pale and was quite silent for some time. it was already dark when he arrived. she poured out as much as they wanted until the spring ran dry. the soldiers outside had already been asleep for a long time and were lying on the ground motionless as if dead. he did not want to throw him down for he might have awakened and have uttered a cry. so he wrapped the horses hoofs in old rags led him carefully out leapt upon him and galloped off. when day broke the master galloped to the castle on the stolen horse. the count had just got up and was looking out of the window. then he set a ladder up to the bedroom put the dead body on his shoulders and began to climb up. the night was sufficiently lighted by the moon for the master to see distinctly how the count got out of the window on to the ladder came down carried the dead body into the garden and began to dig a hole in which to lay it. i will not put him to open shame besides i am sorry for the parents. what a long face the count did pull when the master came next morning and brought him the sheet and the ring. then he lighted the little light put the crab on the ground and let it creep about. he took a second out of the sack and treated it in the same way and so on until the last was out of the sack. the last day is at hand whosoever wishes to go to heaven with me must creep into the sack. the parson crept in first and then the clerk. next morning he went to the count and told him that he had performed the third task also and had carried the parson and clerk out of the church. he returned home thought no more of what he had found and went to bed. just as he was going to sleep it seemed to him as if some one was saying his name. my sisters have gone away but i have been forced to stay behind. she snatched it in haste and wanted to go away with it. the giant only made two steps more and they reached the foot of the mountain where the giant put him down. he began to climb but that was useless for he always slipped back again. whilst he was standing thus not knowing what to do he saw not far from him two men who were struggling fiercely together. the saddle belongs to us in common. he went to the door and knocked. when he had knocked for the third time an old woman with a brown face and red eyes opened the door. she had spectacles on her long nose and looked sharply at him then she asked what he wanted. thou art tired lay thy head in my lap and sleep. the work made no progress. the maiden however did not desert him in his need. she brought him his food at noon and when he had eaten he laid his head on her lap and went to sleep. when he awoke the entire pile of wood was burning in one enormous flame which stretched its tongues out into the sky. but there is a log lying there which wont burn bring it out for me. he carried the log out and laid it down. hardly however had the wood touched the earth than it was transformed and the beautiful maiden who had helped him in his need stood before him and by the silken and shining golden garments which she wore he knew right well that she was the kings daughter. promise to be true to me and thou shalt be my husband. the maiden left the gold and silver where it was and took only the precious stones. then he made himself known and his parents fell on his neck with joy and his heart was so moved that he forgot what the maiden had said and kissed them on both cheeks. but when he had given them the kiss on the right cheek every thought of the kings daughter vanished from him. the parents had not the least idea what to do with the riches. every evening she went into the town and passed the young mans house he often saw her but he no longer knew her. when all the guests were assembled she entered the hall. every one was amazed at the beautiful dress and the bride most of all and as pretty dresses were the things she had most delight in she went to the stranger and asked if she would sell it to her. sadly next morning she went back to her hut in the forest. hast thou forgotten thou held me dear on this the mother tore up a handful of the beautiful ears of corn and cleaned the frock with them. so the ears were left as they now grow. the knock was not at the door of his room but at the door of his heart. hast thou shared thy bread with the hungry if a beggar came i turned away my eyes from him. then there was another knock but the knock was at the door of his room. it was his neighbour a poor man who had a number of children whom he could no longer satisfy with food. no one knew exactly how it came to pass but no one grieved for him. everything was quiet only the moon appeared above the grave and frequently an owl flew past and uttered her melancholy cry. didnt i say so at once the devil looked in himself with his burning eyes and convinced himself of the truth. this time he stayed away longer and when at length he appeared he was panting under the weight of a sack which lay on his shoulders. the poor soul was saved. then there was one who loved the kings daughter and he asked the king if he might have her. meanwhile the kings daughter had fallen quite deep down into the earth into a great cave. an old fellow with a very long gray beard came to meet her and told her that if she would be his servant and do everything he bade her she might live if not he would kill her. so she did all he bade her. the princess had to cook his dinner make his bed and do all his work and when he came home again he always brought with him a heap of gold and silver. then once when he was out and she had made his bed and washed his dishes she shut the doors and windows all fast and there was one little window through which the light shone in and this she left open. but she said not until he gave her the ladder with which he ascended the mountain. then whether he would or not he had to tell her where the ladder was. and she fastened a very long ribbon to the window and then she set up the ladder and ascended the mountain and when she was at the top of it she opened the window. she went to her father and told him all that had happened to her. so she changed the eldest into an eagle which was forced to dwell in the rocky mountains and was often seen sweeping in great circles in the sky. each of them only bore his human form for only two hours daily. the third son who was afraid she might change him into a raging wild beast a bear perhaps or a wolf went secretly away. and as his heart was without fear he caught at the idea of seeking out the castle of the golden sun. he had already travelled about for a long time without being able to find it when he came by chance into a great forest and did not know the way out of it. he entered and went through all the rooms until in the last he found the kings daughter. but how shocked he was when he saw her. after a long struggle he plunged his sword in the animals body and it fell down. the egg did not however fall into the sea but on a fishermans hut which stood on the shore and the hut began at once to smoke and was about to break out in flames. the other brother the whale had come swimming to them and had driven the water up on high. there they sat in the darkness and knew not when day or night began. the sky was blue and a fresh breeze played on their faces but how melancholy everything looked all around her fathers castle lay in ruins the town and the villages were so far as could be seen destroyed by fire the fields far and wide laid to waste and no human being was visible. but where were they to go at last they arrived in a large city and went to the royal palace. his father had chosen another bride for him whose face was as ugly as her heart was wicked. thereupon they entered the church and the priest joined their hands together before the altar and married them. he led her home but she did not speak a single word the whole way. today however the sun is shining on me once more. the false bride was rewarded for what she had done by having her head cut off. who sits within this tower now it chanced that as a lion was eating meat a bone stuck in his throat. he told him why. whereupon the bone dropped and fell out. as soon as he had caused the bone to fall he got out of the lions mouth striking the stick with his beak so that it fell out and then settled on a branch. the lion gets well and one day was eating a buffalo he had killed. your majesty and having thus spoken the crane flew away. in a country there was a raja who had an only son who every day went out to hunt. the young prince listened to his mother and obeyed her for some time but one day when he was hunting on the three sides where he was allowed to go he remembered what she had said to him about the fourth side and he determined to go and see why she had forbidden him to hunt on that side. the young raja shot at some of them and at once they all flew away up to the sky. that is all they would say. the prince grew very sad when they would not tell him anything more and he threw his gun away and went home. you are our only son. stay with us. if i live and i find her i will come back to you but perhaps i shall die and then i shall never see you again. so they had to let him go though they cried very much at parting with him. his father gave him fine clothes to wear and a fine horse. then he himself got his horse all ready for the journey and he said goodbye to his father and mother and his mother took her handkerchief and wrapped some sweetmeats in it and gave it to her son. he found an ant in it. he took out another. there was an ant in that one too. so he laid the two sweetmeats on the ground and he took out another and another and another until he had taken them all out but in each he found an ant. the rajas son thanked him mounted his horse and continued his journey. said the young raja. the tiger saw her coming and hid the prince in the jungle so that she should not see him. said the wife. then they gave him a good dinner and he stayed with them for three days. the rajas son rode on and on till he came to a third jungle. i will shoot four arrows in four different directions. whosoever gets to the second arrow shall have the second thing the bag. he who gets to the third arrow shall have the third thing the bowl. to this they agreed and the prince shot off his first arrow. when they brought it back to him he shot off the second and when they had found and brought it to him he shot off his third and when they had brought him the third he shot off the fourth. while they were away looking for the fourth arrow the rajas son let his horse loose in the jungle and sat on the bed taking the bowl the stick and rope and the bag with him. then the prince went on till he came to a house where he saw an old woman. she said. then she took him into her house and the rajas son was very glad. by this time night had come. when it was quite black night the princess got up. she dressed herself in her rich clothes and jewels and rolled up her hair and across her head she put a band of diamonds and pearls. then she shone like the moon and her beauty made night day. she came out of her room and sat on the roof of her palace. all the people in her fathers country then went about their work and finished it. the rajas son watched the princess quietly and was very happy. at midnight when everybody had gone to bed the princess came down from her roof and went to her room and when she was in bed and asleep the rajas son got up softly and sat on his bed. so the little bed carried him to the room where she lay fast asleep. this he laid near the princesss bed and then his little bed carried him back to the old womans house. asked the princess. nobody knew the prince had come in the night and put it all there. in the morning the old woman came to the rajas son. so he stayed and they took their dinner out of the bag and the bowl gave them water. then the rajas son sat on his bed and it carried him to the princess. it gave him a splendid shawl and he spread it over the princess as she lay asleep. then he went back to the old womans house and slept till morning. in the morning when the princess saw the shawl she was delighted. her mother was very glad too. let me stay a few days longer. so the old woman let him stay. when it was black night the princess put on her lovely clothes and jewels and sat on her roof. at midnight she went to her room and went to sleep. the bag gave him a glorious ring. she said to the prince. i am a great rajas son. her mother told this to the king. in the morning the rajas son told the old woman that he intended to marry the princess. if he can then he shall marry the princess if he cannot the king will have him killed. you will be killed too if you try. but the prince would not listen to anything she said. if he cannot then i have him killed. the prince was very sorry when he heard this. the rajas son lay down and slept and the ants crushed out the oil for him. the prince was very glad when he saw the oil. the king a long time ago had caught two demons and then as he did not know what to do with them he had shut them up in a cage. he was afraid to let them loose for fear they would eat up all the people in his country and he did not know how to kill them. when he heard of the demons the rajas son was very sad. he said to himself. they were all gold and silver and covered with pearls and diamonds. the king did so and the tigers and the demons fought and fought until the tigers had killed the demons. you must go and beat it. the rajas son thought of his little bed so he went to the old womans house and sat on his bed. the bed flew up with him and the rajas son beat the drum and the king heard him. still when he came down the king would not give him his daughter. it was a very very thick trunk. the rajas son went back to the old womans house. he was very sad and thought that now the raja would certainly kill him. but now what can i do at night he went on his bed to see the princess. asked the princess. said the rajas son. then she pulled out a hair from her head and gave it to the prince. then the wedding took place. the prince always kept his bag bowl bed and stick only as no one ever came to make war on him he never needed to use the stick. then they all sighed to think of the tender little morsel they had let slip. youve turned yourself inside out have you the rajas wife died when they were quite little children so these seven poor princesses were left with no mother to take care of them. let her get the fire at her own house. what does she want with ours now the raja was very fond of his daughters. at last one day he determined to hide and watch his daughters cooking and see how it all happened so he went into the next room and watched them through a hole in the wall. at this he was very angry and sent to have the woman seized and brought before him. one day whilst they were thus sobbing and crying lo and behold and she bade her watch the seven princesses and see if any one gave them anything to eat. the girl would never be so cruel as to tell her mother. then they all began to cry very bitterly. at seeing this all the princesses were very glad and they ate some of the cake and liked it and next day the same thing happened and so it went on for many days. next day while the princesses were eating the cream cake who should come by but their stepmothers daughter. at these words the raja was very sorrowful but because he feared to break his word he went out with a heavy heart to find his daughters. he found them crying by the ruins of their mothers grave. then feeling he could not kill them the raja spoke kindly to them and told them to come out into the jungle with him and there he made a fire and cooked some rice and gave it to them. meantime the seven princesses awoke and when they found themselves all alone in the thick jungle they were much frightened and began to call out as loud as they could in hopes of making their father hear but he was by that time far away and would not have been able to hear them even had their voices been as loud as thunder. do you not hear voices so the first and eldest prince took the eldest princess home with him and married her. and when they got to their own land there was great rejoicing throughout the kingdom at the marriage of the seven young princes to seven such beautiful princesses. then his six brothers said they would go and see what had become of him and they went away but they also did not return. what could six poor women do so he set out on his travels but for some months he could learn nothing to help him in his search. all the rocks and trees you see here were living people once and the magician turned them to what they now are. to this the prince agreed. one day not long after this as the magician was walking in his garden he saw the little girl as he thought playing about and asked her who she was. she told him that for twelve long years the magician had kept her shut up in the tower because she refused to marry him and she was so closely guarded that she saw no hope of release. you have spoken to him angrily for twelve long years now rather speak kindly. the magician greatly delighted begged her to allow the wedding to take place as soon as possible. can death never touch you said he. far far away hundreds of thousands of miles from this there lies a desolate country covered with thick jungle. so saying he went away. many many weary miles did he travel till at last he came to a thick jungle and being very tired sat down under a tree and fell asleep. it was the middle of the day and the heat was very great. he then continued his journey on foot till he arrived once more at the magicians palace where he sat down at the door and began playing with the parrot. then the boy took hold of the parrot and tore off one of its wings and as he did so the magicians right arm fell off. the prince pulled off the parrots second wing and the magicians left arm tumbled off. cried he and fell on his knees. the prince pulled off the parrots right leg the magicians right leg fell off
the prince pulled off the parrots left leg down fell the magicians left. and as to the rest of the world every one went to his own house. with this i shall buy a couple of goats. they will have young ones every six months and thus i shall have a whole herd of goats. then with the goats i shall buy cows. with that gold i shall get a house with four wings. when he is old enough to be danced on his fathers knee i shall sit with a book at the back of the stable and while i am reading the boy will see me jump from his mothers lap and run towards me to be danced on my knee. while he thought this he gave a kick with his foot and broke the pot. all the rice fell over him and made him quite white. the brothers were married but their wives did not do the cooking for the family. it was done by their sister who stopped at home to cook. at noon when she went to bring water it suddenly dried up before her and she began to weep. then after a while the water began slowly to rise. the pitcher filled with water and along with it she sank and was drowned. the instrument had a superior tone and delighted all who heard it. this happening every day the other members of the household thought that some girl friend of theirs was in this manner showing her interest in the young man so they did not trouble themselves to find out how it came about. she brought them water on their arrival and afterwards set cooked rice before them. and that was all the revenge she took. now at that time the water used to run short at the dry season in a certain pond not over large in which there were a good many fish. and he went and sat down at the edge of the water thinking how he should do it. said they. said they. so long as you trust me i wont eat you. him the crane took with him let him go in the pond showed him the whole of it brought him back and let him go again close to the other fish. but he threw it into a fork of the tree struck it with his beak and killed it and then ate its flesh and threw its bones away at the foot of the tree. and in that manner he took all the fish one by one and ate them till he came back and found no more come along. answered the crane. you mean me to understand i suppose that i am your slave who has to lift you up and carry you about with him on the contrary is it you that i am going to destroy. indeed i did not intend to eat you. and he turned round and stepped down into the pond and placed the crab on the mud at its edge. he had also an only son called prince majnun who was a handsome boy with white teeth red lips blue eyes red cheeks red hair and a white skin. they used to take their little knives there and cut the fruits and eat them. when laili woke she told her father of the angels visit to her as she slept but her father paid no attention to her story. her father used to get quite vexed with her. he would say. and she was half mad. the prince heard her and turned round. he asked. laili consented to wait although she was very impatient. she would not listen to a word her father or her mother or her servants said to her but went off into the jungle and wandered from jungle to jungle till she got farther and farther away from her own country. but laili said she did not care she must see prince majnun. there he stopped. and a jackal came down to the river to drink. said the jackal. so off he ran. after the jackal came an enormous snake. so the fish agreed and the snake got a knife and cut him open and out jumped laili. she was now very old. they brought her in and the prince asked her what she wanted. when he touched lailis clothes they caught fire and she and he became young again. they used to go out hunting and they often went from country to country to eat the air and amuse themselves. but prince majnun laughed and went into the jungle. would he be very sorry if she died and would he marry another wife so he sent one of his angels in the form of a fakir into the jungle and the angel went up to laili and threw some powder in her face and instantly she fell to the ground a heap of ashes. prince majnun was in great sorrow and grief when he saw his dear laili turned into a little heap of ashes and he went straight home to his father and for a long long time he would not be comforted. laili is dead. meanwhile laili was living in the jungle where her husband had left her a little heap of ashes. however prince majnun would not walk in the garden any more. the next day laili turned into a pretty little dog and in this shape she came into the palace where prince majnun soon became very fond of her. she followed him everywhere went with him when he was out hunting and helped him to catch his game and prince majnun fed her with milk or bread or anything else he was eating and at night the little dog slept in his bed. i am your wife laili and i want to marry you. dont you remember how you would go through that jungle though i begged and begged you not to go for i told you that harm would happen to me and then a fakir came and threw powder in my face and i became a heap of ashes. how can you be laili in the morning the old woman had turned into the little dog and the prince went to his father and told him all that had happened. an old woman said his father. i have loved you all these long long years. in two days time you must go into the garden and there you will see a beautiful fruit. in the morning laili took her little dogs form and disappeared in the garden. why will he not speak to me you are far far more beautiful than you ever were. after some time had passed very happily prince majnun and his wife went out to eat the air. they came to another kingdom to a beautiful garden. but majnun insisted on going in and in spite of all laili could say he got off the horse to look at the flowers. then he got up and saw the rajas dead body by lailis horse. said majnun. asked majnun. and he made so much of laili. he loved her dearly he could not do enough for her. then he built a splendid palace for her and his son with a great deal of ground about it and lovely gardens and gave them great wealth and heaps of servants to wait on them. the tiger the brahman and the jackal 

once upon a time a tiger was caught in a trap. he tried in vain to get out through the bars and rolled and bit with rage and grief when he failed. by chance a poor brahman came by. cried the tiger. look at me the brahman still more sad asked the road to give him its opinion. the brahman told him all that had occurred. how did it all begin i was in the cage no i wasnt dear dear where are my wits let me see the tiger was in the brahman and the cage came walking by  no thats not it either cried the tiger impatiently. am i born to this only in the world nor is that my only fate. there was not a morsel in his hand to eat nor a drop of water to drink. turn his eyes wherever he might he found a vast desert out of which he saw no means of escape. at last he succeeded heaven threw in his way a ruined well. i am the king of tigers dying here of hunger. for the last three days i have had nothing. fortune has sent you here. if you assist me now you will find a sure help in me throughout your life. do not think that i am a beast of prey. if i take him out he may make me the first morsel of his hungry mouth. no that he will not do. the tiger reached the top of the well and felt himself on safe ground. whenever you are in any difficulty just think of me. i chased him. he finding it impossible to escape my claws jumped into this well and is living to this moment in the very bottom of it. in the same way the goldsmith also may ask you. i beg you as your bosom friend never assist that wretched man though he is your relation as a human being. but never trust a goldsmith. lift me up. release me now. i shall ever remain your servant remember your assistance and help you throughout life in all possible ways. i chased him. he fell into this well. i am going away now to see my father. whenever you are in any difficulty just think of me. i am the king of rats. i will come to you and assist you. therefore never assist him as you have done to us all. and if you do you will suffer for it. the goldsmith caught hold of it and demanded help. therefore he lifted the goldsmith up who now began his story. i am just now dying of hunger. permit me to go away. after ten years of religious life thoughts of home and of his brother rushed into his mind. how is it that you have forgotten me your poor servant for such a long time i have several jewels with me of little value. i do not want anything from him now. i shall do so and request him to have the crown melted the diamonds and gold separated. he must do that kindness at least for me. at once he inquired for the house of his goldsmith friend and found him without difficulty. how came the crown in the jaws of the tiger what were his thoughts when he reached that place we are all the children of fate. so far his statement is true. but how am i going to pass ten years here but how pass ten years that cannot be and i must die. the rat raja issued an order at once to that effect to his army. after reaching it they found that their teeth could not work on the hard stones. he will squeeze them and gather water for drink the king of the rats has promised to do his best to provide you with food. we would now do what we can for your release. thus passed months and years. she breathed her last. she was the only daughter of the king. he promised half his kingdom and his daughters hand to him who would restore her to life. the king at once ordered the cell to be examined. there was the man sitting in it. how had he managed to live so long in the cell some whispered that he must be a divine being. his hair had first to be cut before his face could be seen. the princess too was restored to life. people began to take to their heels at the sight of tigers. that is not a great thing. all the hunters told him that his father was carried away by a tiger. i was the messenger of death sent to deal the blow on his neck. i did it and gave the crown to your honour. how can we expect justice from such a stupid king as that the goldsmith fled for his life. all returned to their homes. he agreed to do so not then but some time afterwards. he wished to go and see his elder brother first and then to return and marry the princess. they met and recognised each other even at a distance. they flew into each others arms. both remained still for a time almost unconscious with joy. that was a friday a day very sacred to that god. the god came and asked him what he wanted. but instead of that they devoured it. the god was greatly enraged. the elder brother was very angry. the brothers had a long talk about each others adventures. while he was anxiously expecting to be fed no one thought of him. now as days went on much treasure both of gold and jewels had been stolen by a thief from the palace of the king. and he was sad because he had pretended to have knowledge. when he said this to the maid she consented and departed quickly. thus thinking he passed the night happily in the chamber. the son took the money and departed. then and there of course the bargain was concluded and the foolish fellow took the dog and continued his journey. he next met with some people fighting about a cat. some of them wanted to kill it but others not. of course they at once gave him the cat and took the money. some of them wished to kill it but others did not. of course the people agreed and were highly delighted. what a fool the fellow was what would he do now that all his money was gone what could he do except return to his father accordingly he went home. exclaimed his father when he had heard how his son had wasted all the money that had been given to him. these creatures got very fond of him and would follow him about during the day and sleep by him at night the cat used to sleep at his feet the dog at his head and the snake over his body with its head hanging on one side and its tail on the other. would that you knew my father continued the snake. at the bottom of that mountain there is a sacred spring. oh how glad he will be to see you he will wish to reward you too. but how can he do that however you may be pleased to accept something at his hand. attended by his three companions the man walked to the well and prepared to jump in according to the snakes directions. exclaimed the cat and dog when they saw what he was going to do. on saying this he dived into the water and was lost to sight. said the dog to the cat. do not be anxious about food. and so the cat did and they both lived very comfortably till their master came again and joined them. his highness commanded his son and the stranger to appear before him. but the snake refused saying that it could not go to its father till it was released from this stranger who had saved it from a most terrible death and whose slave it therefore was. he then returned. on reaching the top of the spring he found his friends the dog and the cat waiting for him. they told one another all they had experienced since they had last seen each other and were all very glad. afterwards they walked together to the river side where it was decided to try the powers of the charmed ring and pot and spoon. the merchants son spoke to the ring and immediately a beautiful house and a lovely princess with golden hair appeared. he spoke to the pot and spoon also and the most delicious dishes of food were provided for them. on finding it the prince rushed off to the palace locked himself up in his room and would not leave it. the king his father was in great distress about the matter and did not know what to do. he feared lest his son should die and leave him without an heir. the old woman consented to help him and bade him not to be anxious as she felt certain that she would succeed in getting the beautiful woman for his sons wife. her keen sense of smell soon brought her to the beautiful princess to whom she appeared as an old hag holding in one hand a stick by way of support. she also embraced and kissed the princess by way of adding force to her words. the beautiful princess was thoroughly deceived. accordingly the beautiful princess asked her husband for the ring and he readily gave it to her. be glad. he at once entered the building and telling the beautiful princess of his intense love entreated her to be his wife. seeing no escape from the difficulty she consented on the condition that he would wait one month for her. meanwhile the merchants son had returned from hunting and was terribly distressed not to find his house and wife. he sat down and determined to put an end to himself. presently the cat and dog came up. so the cat and dog started off at a run and did not stop till they reached the place whither their mistress and the house had been taken. you stay here. so the dog sat down and the cat climbed up to the window of the room wherein the beautiful princess was sitting and entered. the princess recognised the cat and informed it of all that had happened to her since she had left them. she asked. then the cat descended the wall of the house and went and laid down by a rats hole and pretended she was dead. the eldest son of the king of the rats was about to be married. listen. this was rather a bold offer. however they accomplished the thing. the rat immediately seized the precious thing and ran off with it to its king who was very glad and went at once to the cat and released its son. all seemed safe now. they had only to give the ring to him and he would speak to it and the house and beautiful princess would again be with them and everything would go on as happily as before. they thought and ran as fast as their legs could carry them. now on the way they had to cross a stream. the dog swam and the cat sat on its back. now the dog was jealous of the cat so he asked for the ring and threatened to throw the cat into the water if it did not give it up whereupon the cat gave up the ring. sorry moment for the dog at once dropped it and a fish swallowed it. what shall i do said the dog. i have a plan. he soon came back with a dead lamb and gave it to the cat. the cat got inside the lamb and lay down telling the dog to go away a little distance and keep quiet. on this the cat came out and jumped on to the bird and threatened to kill it if it did not recover the lost ring. the king of the fishes did so and the ring was found and carried back to the cat. i can carry it as well as you. so the cat was obliged to give up the ring. the careless dog very soon dropped it again. oh cried the dog. the dog now thoroughly ashamed of itself begged the cats pardon for all the trouble it had given. in a moment his sorrow was turned into joy. that i can do. and making the tortoise bite hold of a stick they themselves took the two ends in their teeth and flew up into the air. this tortoise must have made friends with the wild ducks and they must have made him bite hold of the stick and have flown up into the air to take him to the hills. and speak wise words not out of season. every day the young fellow used to go out and get what he could by begging. this continued for some time till at last he became quite tired of such a wretched life and determined to go and try his luck in another country. he informed his wife of his intention and ordered her to manage somehow or other for the old people during the few months that he would be absent. he begged her to be industrious lest his parents should be angry and curse him. moved with pity for the man the merchant advised him to visit the kind and generous king of that country and offered to accompany him to the court. now at that time it happened that the king was seeking for a brahman to look after a golden temple which he had just had built. his majesty was very glad therefore when he saw the brahman and heard that he was good and honest. two months after this the brahmans wife not having heard any news of her husband left the house and went in quest of him. accordingly on the following morning she went to the place and met her husband. he asked. care you not whether they curse me and i die exclaimed the brahman. but it was not so. the prince accepted the invitation and was treated like a prince. it was well that he thus resolved for in the middle of the night the man rose up and taking a sword in his hand rushed to the prince with the intention of killing him. but he rose up and spoke. he asked. he was suddenly reduced to poverty and had to part with his dog. the merchant himself nearly went mad. the merchant consented and went after the dog right up to the very place where the thieves had hidden the goods. so the merchant and his friends dug about the place and soon came upon all the stolen property. nothing was missing. there was everything just as the thieves had taken them. my friend is wanting the money. how can i pay him thus there will be an end of my debt. accordingly he ran out and killed the poor dog when the letter fell out of its collar. the merchant picked it up and read it. how great was his grief and disappointment when he knew the facts of the case he thought that perhaps this holy man could do something for her. so he sent to him. but he knew that the second bit of advice was true. if you laugh why do you weep nearly all the young men of the place have thus perished and our son will be called on soon. at night he was conducted to the apartment of the princess. they stole over towards him intending to kill him like the others who had been before him but he was ready for them. he laid hold of his sword and when the snakes reached his bed he struck at them and killed them. in the morning the king came as usual to inquire and was surprised to hear his daughter and the prince talking gaily together. asked the king entering the room. the prince remained at the palace for more than a year and then asked permission to visit his own country which was granted. while the prince was staying at the palace he saw his sister who greeted him with smiles and kisses. afterwards he went to his own home and informed his mother and father of his arrival. alas his parents had both become blind from weeping about the loss of their son. whereupon the king expressed his sorrow for having sent him away and all was joy and peace again. he was a farmer but poor was the return his labour brought him. all this while i did not know that you dwelt here. and he laid the milk down and went to his house. the son brought the milk put it down and went back home. from this time forward friendship between us is impossible. the son of seven queens 
once upon a time there lived a king who had seven queens but no children. so quickly did it pass that he scarcely saw it nevertheless a burning desire to capture and possess the beautiful strange creature filled his breast. nearer and nearer he advanced till just as he thought to lay hold of the beautiful strange creature it gave one mighty bound leapt clean over the kings head and fled towards the mountains. she held the vessel of water to the kings lips and as he drank he looked into her eyes and then it became clear to him that the girl was no other than the white hind with the golden horns and silver feet he had chased so far. her beauty bewitched him so he fell on his knees begging her to return with him as his bride but she only laughed saying seven queens were quite enough even for a king to manage. it was a handsome boy but the other queens were very jealous that the youngest amongst them should be so fortunate. through this he disappeared returning in an hour or so laden with sweetmeats which he divided equally amongst the seven blind queens. at last when he was quite a big lad he one day took his bow and arrow and went out to seek for game. it came tumbling past the very window where the white queen was sitting she rose to see what was the matter and looked out. hearing this the lad was delighted beyond measure and gave up the pigeon at once. whereupon the white queen told him to seek her mother without delay and ask for the eyes which she wore as a necklace. now as the son of seven queens could not read he took the fatal message cheerfully and set off to find the white queens mother. they told him it was because the kings only daughter refused to marry so when her father died there would be no heir to the throne. the inhabitants nearly went wild with joy but the son of seven queens said he would not marry the princess unless they first let him recover his mothers eyes. drawing his bow he shot one and it came fluttering past the window. the white hind looked out and lo there was the kings son alive and well. then the lad did as he had been told bravely. one fell dead just beneath the window where the white queen was sitting. he looked back and lo there was nothing left of him but a little heap of ashes then when all was prepared she bade her husband give a grand feast to the king. it came to this that the hall of justice would have to be closed and there too finding no one to find fault and hearing only his own praise he determined to search the country places. so seeking in country places he too came to that very spot. but on inquiry he found that the ages of both were equal. such is the nature of this king replied he. such is the nature of this king now there happened to be a dense forest near their village and this they reached early one morning. so it was in one sense for the leader commenced from a distance and had sung the song over twice before he and his companions commenced to approach the robbers. meanwhile the song was sung a third time. raja rasalu. after a long time however a son was promised to her. the child will be a boy and he will live to be a great man. but for twelve years you must not look upon his face for if either you or his father see it before the twelve years are past you will surely die this is what you must do as soon as the child is born you must send him away to a cellar underneath the ground and never let him see the light of day for twelve years. yet still the king did not send for him so he mounted his steed and set off in the pride of his youth and strength to the palace. art mother of mine so raja rasalu was comforted and began to make ready for fortune. then the prince turned towards the burning forest and lo the voice was the voice of a tiny cricket. nevertheless he kept the hair and went on his way. turn thee back dost love life then stranger i pray         turn thee back why by the time i have given each of you a swing the first will be wanting another no the dog died. then they began to play and it fell to rasalus lot to make the first move. trust me now as of old. so rasalu won and took back his arms. favour me today favour me today she has done no evil. and even whilst he was yet speaking the ass died on the spot first he met a brahman and to him he gave a cake asking him to point out the road to ram but the brahman only took the cake and went on his way without a word. at last he came upon a poor man sitting under a tree and finding out he was hungry the kindly farmer gave him his last cake and sitting down to rest beside him entered into conversation. asked the poor man at length. replied the farmer. the farmer went back to his village rejoicing. such a beautiful boy as he will be has never been seen. but one day the king heard her telling them about the beautiful boy she would have when she was married and he said to himself he should like very much to have such a son the more so that though he had already four queens he had no child. he went therefore to the gardener and told him he wished to marry his daughter. this delighted the gardener and his wife who thought it would indeed be grand for their daughter to become a princess. the king invited all his and he gave the gardener as much money as he wanted. a year later the day drew near on which the gardeners daughter was to have her son and the kings four other queens came constantly to see her. next morning when the king had gone out to hunt his four other queens came to see the gardeners daughter. so at last just to please them she beat it and the king stood before her. he said. then he returned to his hunting. the next day when the king had gone out hunting as usual the four queens again came to see the gardeners daughter. at first she refused but at last she consented. so she beat her drum and the king came to her. the four wives then tied a handkerchief over them. all this they did out of spite. the nurse took the little child and put him into a box and the four queens went back to the gardeners daughter. but she could do nothing. when the king came home he was furious at hearing his youngest wife the gardeners daughter had given him a stone instead of the beautiful little son she had promised him. he made her one of the palace servants and never spoke to her. in the middle of the night the nurse took the box in which was the beautiful little prince and went out to a broad plain in the jungle. this he did. then he brought the child out of his stomach and rejoiced over his beauty. the boy was now six months old. he has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin. i dont care about that but what will become of the child if i am killed he will die. then they both went together to the wide plain and there the dog brought up the boy. so saying she swallowed the little prince. next morning at dawn the dog was taken to the jungle and shot. then she swallowed him and returned to her stable. at the end of another year she went again to the plain and brought up the child. his great beauty made her very happy. then she swallowed him once more and returned to her stable. the child was now three years old. he has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin. at this the queens were terrified. they tore their clothes and their hair and cried. when the king came home at evening he asked them why they were so agitated. no one had ever been able to ride him indeed no one could go near him with safety he was so savage. the next morning she was taken to the jungle and there killed. the beautiful boy now lived in the horses stomach and he stayed in it for one whole year. after he had played for some time the horse swallowed him again. then the horse swallowed him again. meanwhile the horse had overheard all these orders. then you will find in the room some beautiful clothes such as princes wear these you must put on yourself and you must take the sword and gun you will find there too. the king saw his horse had a boy on his back though he could not see the boy distinctly. the horse ate grass and the boy wild fruits which he found in the jungle. off jumped the prince. this the boy did. then the horse gave him some poor common clothes which he told him to put on. this made the boy very sad. the boy did so and his horse instantly became a donkey. then he went away further into the country until he came to a grain merchant of the country who asked him who he was. now the grain merchant lived near the kings palace and one night at twelve oclock the boy was very hot so he went out into the kings cool garden and began to sing a lovely song. she asked. but he answered nothing. thought the little princess and she went away. on the second night the same thing happened and on the third night too. but still he remained silent so she went away. the last three nights i have gone into the kings garden and sung a song and each night the youngest princess has come to me and asked me who i am and whence i came and i have answered nothing. the boy then went home to the grain merchant and at night when every one had gone to bed he went to the kings garden and sang his sweet song again. the youngest princess heard him got up dressed and came to him. she asked. then she went away. for three more nights the boy sang in the kings garden and each night the princess came and asked him the same questions as before and the boy gave her the same answers. the youngest princess ordered a grand elephant to be ready for her the next morning and when the morning came and all was ready she dressed herself in the most lovely clothes and put on her beautiful jewels then she mounted her elephant which was painted blue. in her hand she took a gold necklace. at this everybody laughed and the kings were greatly astonished. the boy went far away from them and stood a long way off to see what would happen. then the kings youngest daughter went all round the garden again holding her gold necklace in her hand and once more she hung it round the boys neck. take care you must not turn him out. then she put him on her elephant and took him to the palace. but i stay at home all day and never hunt. so the boy twisted his own left ear and there he stood no longer a poor common ugly man but a grand young prince with a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin. he rode very far and shot a great many birds and a quantity of deer. nearly all the day long these six princes wandered about looking in vain for game till at last they grew hungry and thirsty and could find no water and they had no food with them. by his side was some delicious water and also some roast meat. he has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin. said the young prince. the young prince stayed under the tree till it was evening then he mounted his horse and rode off to the kings palace. but no one recognised him. they all wondered who he could be and all thought him the most beautiful prince that had ever been seen. at last they asked him who he was. the servants called her and she came. i was the grain merchants servant and one hot night i went into your fathers garden and sang and you heard me and came and asked me who i was and where i came from and i would not answer you. and the same thing happened the next night and the next and on the fourth i told you i was a very poor man and had come from my country to seek service in yours and that i was the grain merchants servant. then she believed him and was very glad that her husband was such a beautiful young prince. she said to him. there is no one like him in this country. then she took him into the palace and showed him to her father and mother and to every one. they all said they had never seen any one like him and were all very happy. said the king. the six princes were very much ashamed but the young prince was very glad. then she went to them and told them and they consented to let her and her husband leave them. in this grand state they travelled to the princes country which was not a great many miles off. when the king his father the gardeners daughters husband saw the princes camp he was very much alarmed and thought a great king had come to make war on him. he sent one of his servants therefore to ask whose camp it was. do not fear me. i am not come to make war on you. i am as if i were your son. i am a prince who has come to see your country and to speak with you. so they all came and the king brought his four wives too. all came at least all but the gardeners daughter. no one had told her to go to the feast for no one had thought of her. asked the prince. while the servants were bringing the gardeners daughter the king thought how handsome the young prince was and he noticed particularly the moon on his forehead and the star on his chin and he wondered in what country the young prince was born. the four wicked wives looked on and were very much surprised and very angry. i never saw any one so beautiful. one day the prince asked the king if he had any children. asked the prince. the king shook his head sadly. the king did not believe him. your wives made you kill them because of me. he put his arms round him and kissed him and cried for joy. i cannot go to your palace. the prince and the fakir 
there was once upon a time a king who had no children. now this king went and laid him down to rest at a place where four roads met so that every one who passed had to step over him. of goods and gold i have no lack but i have lived long and have no children. the king took the sweetmeats and put them in his bosom. after some time two sons were born to the king. then what did the king do but place those two sons in an underground room which he had built in the earth. while the fakir was sitting there the kings sons were sitting down below in their cellar eating their food. just then a hungry ant had carried away a grain of rice from their food and was going along with it to her children. another stronger ant came up and attacked her in order to get this grain of rice. i have long been lame in my feet and i have got just one grain and am carrying it to my children. then the king went and brought his own sons. the fakir chose the eldest son and took him away and set off with him on his journey. he then saw a key of the fakirs lying there he took this key and opened the door of the fakirs house. so the kings son let all the creatures go and took them out of the house and they all returned thanks to god. next he let out all the men who were in prison. so they got ready and began to fight and the kings son threw him. he went in and sat down. on this the king married his daughter to the fakir who was really no fakir but a prince. instantly they killed and brought in a great number. now that king had no son. then the new prince told him that in fact he too was a prince. why the fish laughed. at that moment a very big fish jumped about in the bottom of the basket. inquired the queen. on hearing this the fish laughed aloud. the queen returned to her room in a great rage and on coming to see her in the evening the king noticed that something had disturbed her. he said. impossible be it so. the vizier promised to do his best though he felt almost certain of failure. he sought everywhere and from every one. he had been gone some days when he fell in with an old farmer who also was on a journey to a certain village. the old farmer agreed and they walked along together. the day was hot and the way was long and weary. said the youth. thought the old farmer. said the young man. the old man looking half amused and half angry pushed back the knife muttering something to the effect that his friend was either a fool himself or else trying to play the fool with him. the young man pretended not to notice his reply and remained almost silent till they reached the city a short distance outside which was the old farmers house. exclaimed the young man. said the young man. thought the old farmer. however he kept his thoughts to himself. however he liked the fellow and thinking that he would amuse his wife and daughter he invited him to come and stay at his house as long as he had occasion to remain in the village. the old farmer left him in despair and entered his house laughing. but the fellow is such a fool that i cannot make anything out of him. and saying this he burst into a fit of laughter. said the astonished farmer. this friend of yours is a most wise man. presently he saw the young man and gave him the rest of the present and the message. after a little while the young man appeared with the old farmer. exclaimed the viziers son. the following day he hastened back to his own country taking with him the farmers daughter. immediately on arrival he ran to the palace and informed his father of what he had heard. the poor vizier now almost dead from the expectation of death was at once carried to the king to whom he repeated the news that his son had just brought. said the king. the king had the pit dug and commanded all the maids belonging to the palace to try to jump it. all of them tried but only one succeeded. that one was found to be a man thus was the queen satisfied and the faithful old vizier saved. afterwards as soon as could be the viziers son married the old farmers daughter and a most happy marriage it was. and he told a story of long ago. the lad asked. and they tried to stop him. he shouted. i advise you to be careful how you come near me. the arrow stuck fast in the demons hair. then he shot and shot till he had shot away fifty arrows and they all stuck in the demons hair. he struck him with his club and that stuck too when i came into the forest which you live in i did not trust to my bow and other weapons. it stuck fast in his hair he hit him with his left hand that stuck too with his right foot he kicked him that stuck too then with his left and that stuck too and his head stuck fast like the rest. a noble man more than man is he here he is caught by a demon like me yet he will not fear a bit. replied he. i will not eat you up. presently the merchant went to ask his wife about something and found her lying to all appearance dead in the middle of the room and an arrow fixed in the ground within half a yard of her head. the neighbours quickly gathered and the servants came running upstairs to see what was the matter. on hearing this the merchant went to the king and told him what had taken place. so the next day all the men and boys of the city from the age of ten years upwards assembled and marched by the house of the merchant. as soon as these two appeared in front of the merchants window they were recognised by the merchants wife and at once reported to the king. he continued turning to the two young men. in the evening his majesty and the vizier had a long and earnest talk about their two sons. this was finally agreed to. all kinds of trial may be before me. the soldiers took the money and left they did not however go very far but hid themselves behind rocks and stones and waited till they were quite sure that the prince did not intend to come back. after waiting half an hour the prince became impatient and rose up and walked about. the prince sat down on the bank and being thirsty took up some of the water in his hand. fortunately he looked into his hand before drinking and there to his great astonishment he saw reflected whole and clear the image of a beautiful fairy. he looked round hoping to see the reality but seeing no person he drank the water and put out his hand to take some more. again he saw the reflection in the water which was in his palm. he looked around as before and this time discovered a fairy sitting by the bank on the opposite side of the lake. he waited a little while and then shouted but not getting any reply he got up and went to the brook. he cried and lifting up the prince he poured some water over his head and face. my brother what is this oh do not die and leave me thus. speak speak exclaimed the viziers son. look i have brought some food for you and horses and everything. oh how beautiful she was and while i gazed she took out of her bosom an ivory box and held it up to me. oh she is a fairy of the fairies. i know this from the signs that she gave you. on the way they met two men. these two men belonged to a family of robbers. there were eleven of them altogether. asked the prince. so they all four went to the robbers tower. yes she had agreed to release them on the promise of her marriage with the prince. the viziers son inquired. the prince saw his opportunity and in a moment was riding after him having the woman behind him. and one of the arrows killed the woman so they had to leave her behind. on on they rode until they reached a village where they stayed the night. she agreed to let them stay there for a few days. the viziers son pretended to be utterly ignorant of the place and people. he asked the old woman. dont you know that on the mention of the name ivory city the prince gave a deep sigh. continued the viziers son. said the viziers son. i see her and the princess every day. the viziers son asked her not to speak about them at the palace hoping that because she had been told not to do so she would mention their arrival and thus the princess would be informed of their coming. on seeing her mother the girl pretended to be very angry. she asked. he asked me the name of this country and the name of the king. now where can these men have come from that they do not know these things however they are very great and very rich. in the evening when the old woman had returned to her hut she told the viziers son how sorry she was that she could not help breaking her promise and how the princess had struck her because she mentioned their coming and all about them. said the prince who had eagerly listened to every word. said the viziers son with an astonished air. i know this. the prince exclaimed. the servant obeyed and the old woman fearing lest the elephants should go and push down her hut and kill the prince and his friend begged the princess to let her depart. when it was brought she bade the old woman step into it and desire to be at home. the royal elephants have got loose and are running about wildly. when i heard this i was anxious about you. so the princess gave me this charmed swing to return in. in a moment they were there and there too was the object of their search standing by one of the palace gates and longing to see the prince quite as much as he was longing to see her. oh what a happy meeting it was she could not live without seeing him. taking off the lid he threw it aside on the grass and then washed his hands. the moment the crows ate what was thrown to them they fell down dead. the prince noticed this change in him and asked what was the reason. who could have done this thing listen. tell her that you weep for the loss of your friend who died suddenly this morning. look it is strong and will immediately send her into a deep sleep. this done return. the prince promised that he would do everything as the viziers son had advised him and he kept his promise. she went at once and informed the king of the loss of her necklace but said nothing to him about the pain in her back. the prince took it to a goldsmith and asked him to buy it. asked the man. on this some men went to the king and told him what the fakir had said. while running away from me her necklace got loose and dropped. you wonder at these words but they are not difficult to prove. examine your daughter and you will find the marks of the burn on her back. the king went back to the palace and at once ordered the princesss back to be examined. away they rode fast and far and by the morning were able to rest and talk over their plans in safety. a letter was sent to the chief vizier telling him of all that had happened to the prince and the viziers son since they had left their country. when the vizier read the letter he went and informed the king. the prince and the viziers son most gladly accepted the invitation and received a right noble welcome from the king. henceforth all was sunshine on the path of the prince. their mother one of the most distant stars you see far up in the sky waited alone for her childrens return. now both sun and wind were greedy and selfish. they enjoyed the great feast that had been prepared for them without a thought of saving any of it to take home to their mother but the gentle moon did not forget her. and that is why the sun is so hot to this day. and that is why the wind in the hot weather is still so disagreeable. and that is why the moons light is so soft and cool and beautiful even to this day. however he did not die for several years afterwards and miserable years many of them were. and they let the poor old man know what they felt. one day he met a friend and related to him all his troubles. keep these bags in your own hands and on no account let your sons get to them as long as you are alive. you will soon find them change their conduct towards you. thought he at last he hit upon a plan. when the pigeon went to search for food behind him following following came the crow. the pigeon agreed and they went on in company. one ought to draw the line somewhere. and so they did. the cook saw that his pigeon had brought a friend and hung up another basket for him. how the crow longed for some oh dear says he. thought mr. crow and alighted on a dish containing some dainty food. the cook heard it and looked round. ah said he and threw him into his basket. oh how it hurt byandby the pigeon came in and saw the crow lying there making a great noise. come out im nothing but a greedy crow. they look much prettier for it and so did the flax. how fortunate i am it makes me so happy to know that something can be made of me. i feel that i am growing. i feel that i am in full blossom. well one day some people came who took hold of the flax and pulled it up by the roots which was very painful. and certainly there was plenty of evil in store for the flax. at last it was put on the spinning wheel. but the song is not ended yet i am sure it is only just beginning. how wonderful it is that after all i have suffered i am made something of at last and how white and long i am this is far better than being a mere plant and bearing flowers. after some time the linen was taken into the house and there cut with the scissors and torn into pieces and then pricked with needles. now i shall be of some use in the world as every one ought to be it is the only way to be happy. i am now divided into twelve pieces and yet the whole dozen is all one and the same. years passed away and at last the linen was so worn it could scarcely hold together. then people heard the stories and poetry read and it made them wiser and better for all that was written had a good and sensible meaning and a great blessing was contained in it. i cannot understand it myself and yet it is really so. each time i think that the song is ended and then something higher and better begins for me. i suppose now i shall be sent out to journey about the world so that people may read me. but the paper did not go on its travels. i shall remain at home and be held in honor like some old grandfather as i really am to all these new books. they will do some good. i could not have wandered about as they can yet he who wrote all this has looked at me as every word flowed from his pen upon my surface. now i am able for the first time to learn what is in me and to know ones self is true progress. what will be done with me now i wonder no doubt i shall still go forward. now it happened one day that all the paper in the tub was taken out and laid on the hearth to be burned. perhaps they will find out some day. the whole bundle of paper had been placed on the fire and was soon burning. it was certainly not very pleasant to be burned. all the written letters became quite red in a moment and all the words and thoughts turned to fire. then a number of tiny beings as many as the flowers on the flax had been and invisible to mortal eyes floated above the children. but the children could neither hear nor understand this nor should they for children must not know everything. the daisy 
now listen. near the hedge in the soft green grass grew a little daisy. the sun shone as brightly and warmly upon her as upon the large and beautiful garden flowers so the daisy grew from hour to hour. she felt too happy to care for that. merrily she turned toward the warm sun looked up to the blue sky and listened to the lark singing high in the air. one day the little flower was as joyful as if it had been a great holiday although it was only monday. no wonder the pretty bird flies down to visit them. she trembled for joy and hardly knew what to think. for the yellow center in the daisy looked like gold and the leaves around were glittering white like silver. how happy the little daisy felt no one can describe. the bird kissed her with his beak sang to her and then flew up again into the blue air above. it was at least a quarter of an hour before the daisy could recover herself. half ashamed yet happy in herself she glanced at the other flowers they must have seen the honor she had received and would understand her delight and pleasure. she could see they were all out of temper and it made her very sorry. at this moment there came into the garden a girl with a large glittering knife in her hand. when the sun set she folded up her leaves and went to sleep. she dreamed the whole night long of the warm sun and the pretty little bird. alas he had good reason to be sad he had been caught and made a prisoner in a cage that hung close by the open window. the little daisy wished very much to help him. but what could she do in her anxiety she forgot all the beautiful things around her the warm sunshine and her own pretty shining white leaves. alas they went straight to the little daisy who could not think what they were going to do. the whole morning passed in this manner. my throat is hot and dry i feel as if i had fire and ice within me and the air is so heavy. alas i must die. each little blade of grass is to me as a great tree and each of your white leaves a flower. alas thought the daisy but she could not move a leaf. the evening came and yet no one had come to bring the bird a drop of water. not till morning did the boys come and when they found the bird dead they wept many and bitter tears. they dug a pretty grave for him and adorned it with leaves of flowers. poor bird no one thought of the little flower that had felt more for the poor bird than had any one else and that would have been so glad to help and comfort him if she had been able. the sun shone without and warmed the shell and the rain made it clear and transparent it looked mild and agreeable in broad daylight and dark at night just as it should. asked one. suddenly they felt a pull at the shell. there they lay in a childs hand. a little boy was holding them tightly. and he was gone in a moment. and away he went. yet she remained always poor and at home in the garret lay her only daughter not quite grown up and very delicate and weak. for a whole year she had kept her bed and it seemed as if she could neither die nor get well. all day long the sick girl lay quietly and patiently while her mother went out to earn money. the mother stepped to the window and half opened it. how could it have got into this crack said the mother but she did not believe it would be so. and the plant shot up so fast that one could almost see it grow from day to day. at last she was beginning to let herself hope that her little sick daughter might indeed recover. the little maiden bent down and gently kissed the delicate leaves. this day was like a festival to her. one might have taken him to be carved in marble so still did he stand. below in the street a crowd of children were playing. the others soon joined him but each sang the words that he happened to have heard. only one boy whom they called peter said it was a shame to make game of animals and he would not join in the singing at all. the mother stork tried to comfort her young ones. hark it was hail and snow that she meant but she did not know how to say it better. said the mother. and thus you must place your feet. left right left right then she flew a little way and the young ones took a clumsy little leap. plump down they fell for their bodies were still too heavy for them. will you wait till the boys come to hang to burn or to roast you by the third day they actually began to fly a little. asked the young ones. attend to me thats far more important. one two three now we fly round to the right. one two three now to the left round the chimney. there that was very good. if you do so badly that the general runs his beak through you then the boys will be in the right at least in one way. i know a pond where all the little human children lie till the stork comes to take them to their parents. there lie the pretty little babies dreaming more sweetly than they ever dream afterwards. all the parents are wishing for one of these little ones and the children all want a sister or a brother. we will bring that for him. then he will cry because we have brought a little dead brother to him. the eleven brothers were princes and each went to school with a star on his breast and a sword by his side. the next week she sent the little eliza into the country to a peasant and his wife. but she could not make it so bad for them as she would have liked for they were turned into eleven beautiful wild swans. with a strange cry they flew through the windows of the palace over the park to the forest beyond. it was yet early morning when they passed the peasants cottage where their sister lay asleep in her room. one day passed just like another. willingly would she have turned her into a swan like her brothers but she did not dare to do so for fear of the king. at all events they became flowers because they had rested on elizas head and on her heart. the king was shocked and declared she was not his daughter. then poor eliza wept and thought of her eleven brothers who were far away. she knew not in what direction to go but she was so unhappy and longed so for her brothers who like herself had been driven out into the world that she was determined to seek them. she had been in the wood only a short time when night came on and she quite lost the path so she laid herself down on the soft moss offered up her evening prayer and leaned her head against the stump of a tree. all night long she dreamed of her brothers. she thought they were all children again playing together. in the picture book too everything was living. the birds sang and the people came out of the book and spoke to eliza and her brothers but as the leaves were turned over they darted back again to their places that all might be in order. when she awoke the sun was high in the heavens. then she wandered far into the forest not knowing whither she went. it is god who makes the wild apples grow in the wood to satisfy the hungry and he now showed her one of these trees which was so loaded with fruit that the boughs bent beneath the weight. it was so still that she could hear the sound of her own footsteps as well as the rustling of every withered leaf which she crushed under her feet. here was such solitude as she had never known before the night was very dark. sorrowfully eliza laid herself down to sleep. after a while it seemed to her as if the branches of the trees parted over her head and the mild eyes of angels looked down upon her from heaven. in the morning when she awoke she knew not whether this had really been so or whether she had dreamed it. she continued her wandering but she had not gone far when she met an old woman who had berries in her basket and who gave her a few to eat. eliza asked her if she had not seen eleven princes riding through the forest. eliza bade the old woman farewell and walked by the flowing river till she reached the shore of the open sea. and there before her eyes lay the glorious ocean but not a sail appeared on its surface not even a boat could be seen. how was she to go farther sometimes it became green and sometimes white. but however quietly it lay the waves were always restless on the shore and rose and fell like the breast of a sleeping child. as soon as the sun had disappeared under the water the feathers of the swans fell off and eleven beautiful princes elizas brothers stood near her. she uttered a loud cry for although they were very much changed she knew them immediately. she sprang into their arms and called them each by name. very happy the princes were to see their little sister again they knew her although she had grown so tall and beautiful. therefore we must always be near a resting place before sunset for if we were flying toward the clouds when we recovered our human form we should sink deep into the sea. the very trees and bushes here seem related to us. the wild horses leap over the plains as we have seen them in our childhood. two days longer we can remain here and then we must fly away to a beautiful land which is not our home. how can we take you with us asked the sister. her brothers were again changed to swans. they remained together the whole day. towards evening the rest came back and as the sun went down they resumed their natural forms. but we cannot leave you here. have you courage to go with us they were far from the land when eliza awoke. she thought she must still be dreaming it seemed so strange to feel herself being carried high in the air over the sea. a great cloud floating behind them appeared like a vast mountain and upon it eliza saw her own shadow and those of the eleven swans like gigantic flying things. altogether it formed a more beautiful picture than she had ever before seen but as the sun rose higher and the clouds were left behind the picture vanished. onward the whole day they flew through the air like winged arrows yet more slowly than usual for they had their sister to carry. the weather grew threatening and eliza watched the sinking sun with great anxiety for the little rock in the ocean was not yet in sight. alas she was the cause of their not advancing more quickly. when the sun set they would change to men fall into the sea and be drowned. presently and by this time the sun was half hidden by the waves she caught sight of the rock just below them. it did not look larger than a seals head thrust out of the water. the sea dashed against the rock and covered them with spray. she replied. and this thought took such hold upon her mind that she prayed earnestly to god for help and even in her sleep she continued to pray. their lives hang upon your tongue. she fell on her knees and offered thanks to god. then she went forth from the cave to begin work with her delicate hands. at sunset her brothers returned and were much frightened when she did not speak. eliza kept to her work all night for she could not rest till she had released her brothers. during the whole of the following day while her brothers were absent she sat in solitude but never before had the time flown so quickly. one coat was already finished and she had begun the second when she heard a huntsmans horn and was struck with fear. as the sound came nearer and nearer she also heard dogs barking and fled with terror into the cave. eliza shook her head. she dared not speak for it would cost her brothers their deliverance and their lives. and she hid her hands under her apron so that the king might not see how she was suffering. then he lifted her onto his horse. he galloped away over the mountains holding her before him on his horse and the hunters followed behind them. she looked the very picture of grief. then the king opened the door of a little chamber in which she was to sleep. when eliza saw all these things which lay so near her heart a smile played around her mouth and the crimson blood rushed to her cheeks. the thought of her brothers and their release made her so joyful that she kissed the kings hand. then he pressed her to his heart. oh but dumb she must remain till her task was finished. but when she began the seventh she found she had no more flax. how should she get out there thought she. two tears rolled down the kings cheeks. he went home with doubt in his heart and at night pretended to sleep. quickly she was condemned to suffer death by fire. but they could have given her nothing that would have pleased her more. he had found his sister and she sobbed for joy although she knew that probably this was the last night she had to live. still she had hope for her task was almost finished and her brothers were come. they were told it could not be it was yet night the king slept and could not be disturbed. they threatened they entreated until the guard appeared and even the king himself inquiring what all the noise meant. at this moment the sun rose and the eleven brothers were seen no more but eleven wild swans flew away over the castle. an old horse drew the cart on which she sat. her lovely hair hung loose on her shoulders her cheeks were deadly pale her lips moved silently while her fingers still worked at the green flax. even on the way to death she would not give up her task. and a marriage procession such as no king had ever before seen returned to the castle. we wake by day and sleep by night and then we have our dreams. it is different with the tree it is obliged to keep awake through three seasons of the year and does not get any sleep till winter comes. winter is its time for rest its night after the long day of spring summer and autumn. how very short the little creature would always reply. then i dont understand you. you may have thousands of my days but i have thousands of moments in which i can be merry and happy. the fly was dead. and so on every summer day the dance was repeated the same questions were asked and the same answers given and there was the same peaceful falling asleep at sunset. the oak remained awake through the morning of spring the noon of summer and the evening of autumn its time of rest its night drew near its winter was coming. here fell a leaf and there fell a leaf. go to sleep go to sleep. you are still very young in the world. it was the largest and best tree in the forest. it had no idea how many eyes looked eagerly for it. it was just at the holy christmas time that the tree dreamed a dream. and yet it seemed to be a beautiful summers day mild and warm. the stars became visible in broad daylight large and sparkling like clear and gentle eyes. they brought to the trees memory the light that it had seen in the eyes of a child and in the eyes of lovers who had once met beneath the branches of the old oak. the grand majestic oak could not be quite happy in its enjoyment until all the rest both great and small could share it. at length its longing was satisfied. asked the oak. can such happiness be imagined i can fly up to the very highest point in light and glory. and all i love are with me both small and great. such was the dream of the old oak at the holy christmas time. and while it dreamed a mighty storm came rushing over land and sea. on the morning of christmas day when the sun rose the storm had ceased. exclaimed the sailors. alas how sweetly they sing there it is quite a pleasure to listen to them while she was speaking one of the little singing birds came tumbling head over heels from the roof into the yard. the cat was after him but he had escaped from her with a broken wing and so came fluttering into the yard. they said one after another as they came up. but the duck meant it kindly. said the little bird. but he did not wish for a second bath. my husband is a native of these parts hes not of my race but i am not proud on that account. no the fowls from the neighborhood will soon be here to pay you a visit. then the fowls arrived and the cock was polite enough to keep from being rude. but that does not disturb us we quietly go our way among them. it cannot be said even of the ducks and we warn you little bird not to trust that one yonder with the short tail feathers for she is cunning. now i shall lie down and have a little rest. she had a very comfortable place and felt so at ease that she fell asleep. the sun shone warm and bright and he found it a very good place. all the other ducks laughed at this. after that they all lay down to have a nap. they had been lying asleep for quite a while when suddenly something was thrown into the yard for them to eat. in doing this she trod upon the little singing bird. she retorted. when madam awoke afterwards there he stood before her with a little corn he had found and laid it at her feet but as she had not slept well she was naturally in a bad temper. she said. then certainly he was not made for this world. there was nothing to envy here so they all showed a great deal of pity. he meant the sun which was just setting. the sun went down and the full moon rose large round and clear shining in the deep blue. now it may hang up there and shine so that i may see myself. if i only knew how to manage to move away from this place i should so like to move barked the old yard dog. away away what you see yonder is the moon and what you saw before was the sun. it will come again tomorrow and most likely teach you to run down into the ditch by the well for i think the weather is going to change. there really was a change in the weather. but when the sun rose a splendid sight was to be seen. asked the snow man of the yard dog. asked the snow man. asked the snow man. i can see that in you. i have age and experience. i know every one here in the house and i know there was once a time when i did not lie out here in the cold fastened to a chain. barked the yard dog. it was a much smaller room than those upstairs but i was more comfortable for i was not continually being taken hold of and pulled about by the children as i had been. i received quite as good food and even better. i had my own cushion and there was a stove it is the finest thing in the world at this season of the year. i used to go under the stove and lie down. ah i still dream of that stove. asked the snow man. one has to keep on one side or under it to be comfortable. the sight of this gave the snow man a strange sensation it was very odd he knew not what it meant and he could not account for it. but there are people who are not men of snow who understand what the feeling is. but they were very angry and since that time i have been fastened to a chain and have lost my voice. dont you hear how hoarse i am away away i cant talk like other dogs any more. away away but the snow man was no longer listening. it is an innocent wish and innocent wishes are sure to be fulfilled. they were the most beautiful ice flowers any snow man could desire but they concealed the stove. but he did not enjoy it. the weather did change. one morning he broke and sank down altogether and behold it was the pole round which the boys had built him. but it is all over now. and soon the winter passed. and nobody thought any more of the snow man. but the yard cock is something like a cock. if he would only come in here during the night the weather became very bad hens chickens and even the cock himself sought shelter. asked the yard cock of his hens and chickens. then the hens came running up and the chickens followed for where one runs the rest run also. i could lay a wind egg if i liked but the world is not worth a wind egg. he did not kill the yard cock although the hens said he intended to do so. and what does the moral say in the center of the village there lived an old shoemakers wife. the little girls name was karen. on the very day that karen received the shoes her mother was to be buried. karen supposed that all this happened because of the red shoes but the old lady thought them frightful and ordered them to be burned. it happened not long afterwards that the queen and her little daughter the princess traveled through the land. surely nothing in the world could be compared to those red shoes. the rich shoemaker in the town took the measure of her little feet in his own house in a room where stood great glass cases filled with all sorts of fine shoes and elegant shining boots. it was a pretty sight but the old lady could not see well and naturally did not take so much pleasure in it as karen. among the shoes were a pair of red ones just like those worn by the little princess. oh how gay they were the shoemaker said they had been made for the child of a count but had not fitted well. asked the old lady. and since they fitted her they were bought. she looked at her black shoes and then at her red ones then again at the black and at the red and the red ones were put on. he bowed almost to the ground and asked the old lady if he might dust her shoes. karen in her turn put out her little foot. said the old soldier. as before every one saw karens red shoes and all the carved figures too bent their gaze upon them. at last all the people left the church and the old lady got into her carriage. and karen in spite of herself made a few dancing steps. when she had once begun her feet went on of themselves it was as though the shoes had received power over her. she danced round the church corner she could not help it and the coachman had to run behind and catch her to put her into the carriage. still her feet went on dancing so that she trod upon the good ladys toes. it was not until the shoes were taken from her feet that she had rest. the shoes were put away in a closet but karen could not resist going to look at them every now and then. soon after this the old lady lay ill in bed and it was said that she could not recover. but there happened to be a great ball in the town and karen was invited. she looked at the old lady who was very ill and she looked at the red shoes. she put them on for she thought there could not be any sin in that and of course there was not but she went next to the ball and began to dance. down the stairs they carried her at last into the street and out through the town gate. on and on she danced for dance she must straight out into the gloomy wood. they seemed to have grown fast to her feet. so dance she must and dance she did over field and meadow in rain and in sunshine by night and by day and by night it was by far more dreadful. she danced past the open church door and there she saw an angel in long white robes and with wings that reached from his shoulders to the earth. his look was stern and grave and in his hand he held a broad glittering sword. thou shalt dance from door to door and wherever proud haughty children dwell thou shalt knock that hearing thee they may take warning. cried karen but she did not hear the answer of the angel for the shoes carried her past the door and on into the fields. she knew that her friend the old lady was dead and in her heart she felt that she was abandoned by all on earth and condemned by gods angel in heaven. to karen it seemed that the feet had gone with the shoes for she had almost lost the power of walking. so she took courage and went again. she did not want wages she said only a home with good people. on sunday when they all went to church they asked her if she would not go too but she looked sad and bade them go without her. then the sun shone brightly and before her stood the white angel that she had seen at the church door. he no longer bore the glittering sword but in his hand was a beautiful branch of roses. he touched the ceiling with it and the ceiling rose and at each place where the branch touched it there shone a star. there dwell the sea king and his subjects. we must not imagine that there is nothing at the bottom of the sea but bare yellow sand. in the deepest spot of all stands the castle of the sea king. they were beautiful children but the youngest was the prettiest of them all. her skin was as clear and delicate as a rose leaf and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea but like all the others she had no feet and her body ended in a fishs tail. each of the young princesses had a little plot of ground in the garden where she might dig and plant as she pleased. one arranged her flower bed in the form of a whale another preferred to make hers like the figure of a little mermaid while the youngest child made hers round like the sun and in it grew flowers as red as his rays at sunset. she was a strange child quiet and thoughtful. the shadows had the color of violet and waved to and fro like the branches so that it seemed as if the crown of the tree and the root were at play trying to kiss each other. nothing gave her so much pleasure as to hear about the world above the sea. she made her old grandmother tell her all she knew of the ships and of the towns the people and the animals. her grandmother called the birds fishes or the little mermaid would not have understood what was meant for she had never seen birds. in the following year one of the sisters would be fifteen but as each was a year younger than the other the youngest would have to wait five years before her turn came to rise up from the bottom of the ocean to see the earth as we do. however each promised to tell the others what she saw on her first visit and what she thought was most beautiful. their grandmother could not tell them enough there were so many things about which they wanted to know. she could see the moon and stars shining faintly but through the water they looked larger than they do to our eyes. at length the eldest was fifteen and was allowed to rise to the surface of the ocean. when she returned she had hundreds of things to talk about. because she could not go near all these wonderful things she longed for them all the more. in another year the second sister received permission to rise to the surface of the water and to swim about where she pleased. she rose just as the sun was setting and this she said was the most beautiful sight of all. and more swiftly than the clouds flew a large flock of wild swans toward the setting sun like a long white veil across the sea. she wanted to play with them but they fled in a great fright and then a little black animal it was a dog but she did not know it for she had never seen one before came to the water and barked at her so furiously that she became frightened and rushed back to the open sea. but she said she should never forget the beautiful forest the green hills and the pretty children who could swim in the water although they had no tails. the fourth sister was more timid. she remained in the midst of the sea but said it was quite as beautiful there as nearer the land. she could see many miles around her and the sky above looked like a bell of glass. the fifth sisters birthday occurred in the winter so when her turn came she saw what the others had not seen the first time they went up. she had seated herself on one of the largest and let the wind play with her long hair. these things were never beautiful to them for if the ship sank the men were drowned and their dead bodies alone reached the palace of the sea king. said she. and she placed in her hair a wreath of white lilies of which every flower leaf was half a pearl. the red flowers in her own garden would have suited her much better. the sun had just set when she raised her head above the waves. the sea was calm and the air mild and fresh. among them and the most beautiful of all was a young prince with large black eyes. the little mermaid was so startled that she dived under water and when she again stretched out her head it looked as if all the stars of heaven were falling around her. it was very late yet the little mermaid could not take her eyes from the ship or from the beautiful prince. after a while the sails were quickly set and the ship went on her way. a dreadful storm was approaching. to the little mermaid this was pleasant sport but not so to the sailors. at one moment it was pitch dark so that she could not see a single object but when a flash of lightning came it revealed the whole scene she could see every one who had been on board except the prince. when the ship parted she had seen him sink into the deep waves and she was glad for she thought he would now be with her. then she remembered that human beings could not live in the water so that when he got down to her fathers palace he would certainly be quite dead. no he must not die she held his head above the water and let the waves carry them where they would. he seemed to her like the marble statue in her little garden so she kissed him again and wished that he might live. presently they came in sight of land and she saw lofty blue mountains on which the white snow rested as if a flock of swans were lying upon them. the sea here formed a little bay in which the water lay quiet and still but very deep. she swam with the handsome prince to the beach which was covered with fine white sand and there she laid him in the warm sunshine taking care to raise his head higher than his body. then bells sounded in the large white building and some young girls came into the garden. the little mermaid swam out farther from the shore and hid herself among some high rocks that rose out of the water. covering her head and neck with the foam of the sea she watched there to see what would become of the poor prince. it was not long before she saw a young girl approach the spot where the prince lay. she seemed frightened at first but only for a moment then she brought a number of people and the mermaid saw that the prince came to life again and smiled upon those who stood about him. but to her he sent no smile he knew not that she had saved him. this made her very sorrowful and when he was led away into the great building she dived down into the water and returned to her fathers castle. she had always been silent and thoughtful and now she was more so than ever. her sisters asked her what she had seen during her first visit to the surface of the water but she could tell them nothing. many an evening and morning did she rise to the place where she had left the prince. at length she could bear it no longer and told one of her sisters all about it. she had also seen the festival on board ship and she told them where the prince came from and where his palace stood. now that the little mermaid knew where the prince lived she spent many an evening and many a night on the water near the palace. here she sat and watched the young prince who thought himself alone in the bright moonlight. and this made her glad that she had saved his life when he was tossed about half dead on the waves. she remembered how his head had rested on her bosom and how heartily she had kissed him but he knew nothing of all this and could not even dream of her. she grew more and more to like human beings and wished more and more to be able to wander about with those whose world seemed to be so much larger than her own. they could fly over the sea in ships and mount the high hills which were far above the clouds and the lands they possessed their woods and their fields stretched far away beyond the reach of her sight. there was so much that she wished to know but her sisters were unable to answer all her questions. human beings on the contrary have souls which live forever even after the body has been turned to dust. they rise up through the clear pure air beyond the glittering stars. your fishs tail which among us is considered so beautiful on earth is thought to be quite ugly. then the little mermaid sighed and looked sorrowfully at her fishs tail. after that we can rest ourselves all the better. no one on earth has such lovely voices as they but the little mermaid sang more sweetly than all. but soon she thought again of the world above her she could not forget the charming prince nor her sorrow that she had not an immortal soul like his. i will venture all for him and to win an immortal soul. she had never been that way before. the little mermaid was so alarmed at what she saw that she stood still and her heart beat with fear. she came very near turning back but she thought of the prince and of the human soul for which she longed and her courage returned. but all who see you will say that you are the prettiest little human being they ever saw. you will never return through the water to your sisters or to your fathers palace again. and if you do not win the love of the prince so that he is willing to forget his father and mother for your sake and to love you with his whole soul and allow the priest to join your hands that you may be man and wife then you will never have an immortal soul. you have the sweetest voice of any who dwell here in the depths of the sea and you believe that you will be able to charm the prince with it. but this voice you must give to me. well have you lost your courage the steam that rose twisted itself into such horrible shapes that no one could look at them without fear. then she cut off the mermaids tongue so that she would never again speak or sing. but she did not venture to go in to them for now that she was dumb and going to leave them forever she felt as if her heart would break. the sun had not risen when she came in sight of the princes palace and approached the beautiful marble steps but the moon shone clear and bright. when the sun rose and shone over the sea she recovered and felt a sharp pain but before her stood the handsome young prince. but she had no clothes so she wrapped herself in her long thick hair. the prince asked her who she was and whence she came. he took her by the hand and led her to the palace. beautiful female slaves dressed in silk and gold stepped forward and sang before the prince and his royal parents. one sang better than all the others and the prince clapped his hands and smiled at her. she danced again quite readily to please him though each time her foot touched the floor it seemed as if she trod on sharp knives. the prince said she should remain with him always and she was given permission to sleep at his door on a velvet cushion. he had a pages dress made for her that she might accompany him on horseback. it was then that she thought of all those below in the deep. once during the night her sisters came up arm in arm singing sorrowfully as they floated on the water. once she saw in the distance her old grandmother who had not been to the surface of the sea for many years and the old sea king her father with his crown on his head. they stretched out their hands towards her but did not venture so near the land as her sisters had. as the days passed she loved the prince more dearly and he loved her as one would love a little child. the thought never came to him to make her his wife. the eyes of the little mermaid seemed to say when he took her in his arms and kissed her fair forehead. you are like a young maiden whom i once saw but whom i shall never meet again. the youngest of them found me on the shore and saved my life. i saw her but twice and she is the only one in the world whom i could love. but you are like her and you have almost driven her image from my mind. we will never part. the mermaid sighed deeply but she could not weep. i am by his side and see him every day. very soon it was said that the prince was to marry and that the beautiful daughter of a neighboring king would be his wife for a fine ship was being fitted out. although the prince gave out that he intended merely to pay a visit to the king it was generally supposed that he went to court the princess. a great company were to go with him. the little mermaid smiled and shook her head. she knew the princes thoughts better than any of the others. then he kissed her rosy mouth played with her long waving hair and laid his head on her heart while she dreamed of human happiness and an immortal soul. he said as they stood on the deck of the noble ship which was to carry them to the country of the neighboring king. but the cabin boy approached and when her sisters dived down he thought what he saw was only the foam of the sea. but the princess had not yet appeared. at last she came. then the little mermaid who was anxious to see whether she was really beautiful was obliged to admit that she had never seen a more perfect vision of beauty. the little mermaid kissed his hand and felt as if her heart were already broken. his wedding morning would bring death to her and she would change into the foam of the sea. she thought of the night of death which was coming to her and of all she had lost in the world. on the same evening the bride and bridegroom went on board the ship. when it grew dark a number of colored lamps were lighted and the sailors danced merrily on the deck. an eternal night without a thought or a dream awaited her. she had no soul and now could never win one. she smiled and danced with the rest while the thought of death was in her heart. she saw her sisters rising out of the flood. they were as pale as she but their beautiful hair no longer waved in the wind it had been cut off. she has given us a knife see it is very sharp. when the warm blood falls upon your feet they will grow together again into a fishs tail and you will once more be a mermaid and can return to us to live out your three hundred years before you are changed into the salt sea foam. kill the prince and come back. the little mermaid drew back the crimson curtain of the tent and beheld the fair bride whose head was resting on the princes breast. she bent down and kissed his noble brow then looked at the sky on which the rosy dawn grew brighter and brighter. she glanced at the sharp knife and again fixed her eyes on the prince who whispered the name of his bride in his dreams. she was in his thoughts and the knife trembled in the hand of the little mermaid but she flung it far from her into the waves. the sun rose above the waves and his warm rays fell on the cold foam of the little mermaid who did not feel as if she were dying. she saw the bright sun and hundreds of transparent beautiful creatures floating around her she could see through them the white sails of the ships and the red clouds in the sky. the little mermaid perceived that she had a body like theirs and that she continued to rise higher and higher out of the foam. you poor little mermaid have tried with your whole heart to do as we are doing. on the ship in which she had left the prince there were life and noise and she saw him and his beautiful bride searching for her. the child does not know when we fly through the room that we smile with joy at his good conduct for we can count one year less of our three hundred years. but how is it that the lightning did it my flowers are as pretty as apple blossoms. it is a treat to look at me and my companions. now there came on a dreadful storm and the flowers of the field folded their leaves or bent their heads as it passed over them. even human beings dare not do that for in the midst of the lightning one may look straight into gods heaven. indeed they told it to me one evening when i had asked them for a story. guests always expressed their delight and admiration at the sight of its wonders. she smiled as she saw it and begged the son of the house to get one of them for her. and every new flower that came was told of this wonderful event. the young pine trees in the wood began to feel a longing for christmas though christmas was still a long way off. they were engaged and now they are married the wedding was a week ago. some weeks passed. she said. it pricked his fingers for his pains because he had called it a ghost. and then it was brought into the garden and to the hall and into the drawing room. the air took all their words and scattered them about far and wide. and here is the story what will come next it is wonderful and extraordinary what a number of things come out of me. i myself dont understand how it is for i am not acquainted with nature but it is certainly in me. if you did you would see that you can only provide the means. do you imagine you are a poet these sounds seemed to come not only from the strings but from every part of the instrument. it was as if soul and spirit had been breathed into the instrument. to him alone the honor is due. yes this is what the poet wrote. i gave you a cut from within me. cried the pen. and each of them felt satisfied that he had given a good answer. it is pleasing to be convinced that you have settled a matter by your reply it is something to make you sleep well. and they both slept well over it. but the poet did not sleep. it had something before and behind the spout before and the handle behind and that was what it talked about. i have a spout and that makes me the queen of the tea table. it stood on the table that was spread for tea it was lifted by a very delicate hand but the delicate hand was awkward. the lid was no worse to speak of the worst had been spoken of that. i fell into poverty and stood dumb both outside and in. but then just as i was began my better life. one can be one thing and still become quite another. there was life in me power and might. the flower gave me no thanks it did not think of me. it was admired and praised and i was glad at that. how happy it must have been one day i heard some one say that the flower deserved a better pot. shall i tell you what we had they wish very much to be the queen but they do not want to take the trouble to go out into the world to learn how to make soup which it is absolutely necessary to do first. only four mice gave notice that they were ready to set out on the journey. they left home early in may and none of them returned till the first of may in the following year and then only three of them. nothing was seen or heard of the fourth although the day of decision was close at hand. but he gave orders that all the mice within a circle of many miles should be invited at once. no one dared express an opinion until the king spoke and desired one of them to proceed with her story. and now we shall hear what she said. as soon as we arrived at the port to which the ship was bound i left it and went on shore at a place far towards the north. there were great lakes also which looked as black as ink at a distance but were quite clear when i came close to them. large swans were floating upon them and i thought at first they were only foam they lay so still but when i saw them walk and fly i knew directly what they were. they belonged to the goose species. the moon shone particularly bright on one spot where stood a tree covered with very fine moss. the effect was by no means bad. see it is pointed at the top is it not capital they all cried. they invited me to be present at the feast but i was to keep at a certain distance because i was too large for them. then began music that sounded like a thousand glass bells and was so full and strong that i thought it must be the song of the swans. i could scarcely believe that so much could have been produced from it till i remembered into what hands it had fallen. i was so much affected that i wept tears such as a little mouse can weep but they were tears of joy. then i told them all about it and why i had traveled so far and also what promise had been made at home to the one who should discover the method of preparing this soup. that would only produce a dish to be served when people were keeping a fast. thereupon she turned the staff round and behold not a single flower was to be seen on it today and while on my journey are the only times i have ever seen a kitchen. we were often obliged to suffer hunger in the library but we gained a great deal of knowledge. she asked me if i was a poet. then she said i must go out and make myself a poet. understanding is the most important matter of all. where was i to find it i learned this from living in a library. so i went straight on till i came to the first great ant hill. there i set myself to watch that i might become wise. the ants are a very respectable people they are wisdom itself. this they truly do. her opinion is the only correct one on everything and she seems to have in her the wisdom of the whole world. she said a great deal that was no doubt very clever yet it sounded like nonsense to me. yet she made no mention of the tree. once i saw one of them who had dropped her load try very hard to raise it again but she did not succeed. then they were obliged to stop a moment for every one must think of himself first. so saying she raised herself on her two hind legs that no one else might be mistaken for her. i could not therefore have made a mistake so i ate her up. we are to go to the ants to learn wisdom and i had secured the queen. i had heard this in the library and here was just such a tree and in it an oak maiden. she uttered a terrible scream when she caught sight of me so near to her. at last she took me up in her delicate hand and i told her what had brought me out into the world. she told me that perhaps on that very evening she would be able to obtain for me one of the two treasures for which i was seeking. that feather you shall have. a better was never given to any poet and it will be quite enough for you. now however i had two of them understanding and imagination and through these i knew that the third was to be found in the library. i remembered a few of these books. i then ate a small piece of a third romance and felt myself a poet. i said it to myself and told others the same. i remembered the man who placed in his mouth a white stick by which he could make himself and the stick invisible. as i am at last a poet and have worked terribly hard to make myself one i can of course make poetry on anything. she spoke out so clearly and plainly and she had come in so suddenly that no one had time to stop her or to say a word while she was speaking. this is what she said. i have a very bad memory for names. he divided his bread and water with me and gave me cheese and sausage and i began to love him. he let me run about on his hand on his arm into his sleeve and even into his beard. i wished to stay with him always for i knew that if i went away the poor prisoner would have no one to be his friend which is a sad thing. then he went away and never came back. i know nothing more of his history. oh how dreadful it was i had to run round and round without getting any farther and only to make everybody laugh. free free that was all i could think of and not of the object of my journey. i exclaimed. i was quite struck. truth is not always agreeable but truth is above everything else as the old owl said. will you now set the kettle on the fire so asked the king. and very soon the wedding took place. every time i think of this story it seems to me more and more charming for it is with stories as it is with many people they become better as they grow older. yet after a time the old people thought it would be as well to sell the horse or exchange it for something which might be more useful to them. but what should this something be the sun shone with great heat and not a cloud was to be seen in the sky. the road was very dusty for many people all going to the fair were driving riding or walking upon it. there was no shelter anywhere from the hot sun. the cow was as beautiful a creature as any cow could be. accordingly the exchange was made. when the matter was settled the peasant might have turned back for he had done the business he came to do. but having made up his mind to go to the fair he determined to do so if only to have a look at it. so on he went to the town with his cow. it was a good fat sheep with a fine fleece on its back. the man with the sheep was quite ready and the bargain was quickly made. said the peasant. now here is an opportunity and if possible i will get it for her. shall we exchange by this time he had arrived very near the town. i think it would be a good exchange if i could get it for my goose. repeated the man. now he really had done a great deal of business on his way to the fair and he was hot and tired. asked the peasant. it was property my old woman said. he leaned the sack carefully against the stove and then went to the table. but the stove was hot and he had not thought of that. the apples were beginning to roast. asked one. said the peasant. and so the bet was made. soon they had stopped at the peasants hut. then she embraced him and paid no attention to the strangers nor did she notice the sack. said she. cried the wife. you dear old man you are always thinking of something to please me. this is delightful. exclaimed the wife. i begged her to lend me a handful of herbs. she exclaimed i have nothing to lend. then she gave him a hearty kiss. this is a story which i heard when i was a child. the old street lamp 
did you ever hear the story of the old street lamp it was this very evening at its post for the last time giving light to the street. in this latter case it might be turned into anything and it wondered very much whether it would then be able to remember that it had once been a street lamp. this troubled it exceedingly. whatever might happen it seemed certain that the lamp would be separated from the watchman and his wife whose family it looked upon as its own. ah well it was a very long time since one became a lamp and the other a watchman. this was the lamps last night in the street and tomorrow it must go to the town hall two very dark things to think of. no wonder it did not burn brightly. how many persons it had lighted on their way and how much it had seen as one thing after another was recalled to its mind the light would flash up with sudden brightness. at such moments the lamp had a conviction that it would be remembered. the writing was elegant evidently a ladys. twice he read it through and kissed it and then looked up at me with eyes that said quite plainly i am the happiest of men ah yes and there was another pair of eyes that i remember it is really wonderful how the thoughts jump from one thing to another a funeral passed through the street. the old lamp assured them that not one of them could give sufficient light to fill the position of a street lamp but they would believe nothing that it said. it asked. is this evening the last time we shall meet then i must present you with a farewell gift. at this moment the moon burst forth from the clouds. asked the wind. just then a drop fell upon the lamp from the roof of the house but the drop explained that it was a gift from those gray clouds and perhaps the best of all gifts. but this seemed to the lamp a very shabby present and the wind thought so too. shouted the breath of the wind as loud as it could. i really believe it went into the lamp. and so they did all three while the old lamp threw a wonderfully strong light all around. the stars have not thought of this. so it laid itself to rest. the next day well perhaps we had better pass over the next day. the evening had come and the lamp was resting in a grandfathers chair and guess where why at the old watchmans house. he looked upon it almost as his own child. he had no children so the lamp was given to him. it seemed almost to have grown larger for it appeared quite to fill the chair. it is quite true that they dwelt in a cellar two yards below ground and had to cross a stone passage to get to their room. the bed and the little window had curtains and everything looked clean and neat. it seemed to the lamp as if the whole world had turned round. then the lamp felt that all was well again. it saw everything that had happened quite clearly as if the events were passing before it. surely the wind had given it an excellent gift the old people were very active and industrious they were never idle for even a single hour. ah so there were now candles enough but it never occurred to any one to put a little piece in the lamp. the lamp however was always kept clean and shining in a corner where it attracted all eyes. but after all no wax light was placed in the lamp only oil as usual. the lamp burned through the whole evening and began to perceive too clearly that the gift of the stars would remain a hidden treasure all its life. this caused the lamp quite as much anxiety as on the day when it had been called upon to appear before the mayor and the council at the town hall. they love me for myself alone they keep me bright and supply me with oil. just such a one stood in a certain parlor. moreover he had crooked legs little horns upon his forehead and a long beard. very few there are whether in wood or in stone who could get such a title. however there he was. he was as clean and neat as any other figure. this was certainly a mistake it ought to have been black. from the first he had been placed there and he always remained on the same spot for they had promised to be true to each other. close to them stood another figure three times as large as themselves. and upon this he nodded his head and fell asleep. she said. asked the chimney sweep. well do i know the way we shall come out by the chimney and then i shall know how to manage. and he led her to the door of the stove. she said. there actually was a star in the sky that was shining right down upon them as if to show them the way. now they climbed and crept a frightful way it was so steep and high but he went first to guide and to smooth the way as much as he could. he showed her the best places on which to set her little china foot till at last they came to the edge of the chimney and sat down to rest for they were very tired as may well be supposed. they saw all around them the great wide world. the world is too large i wish i were safe back again upon the little table under the mirror. i shall never be happy till i am there once more. i have followed you out into the wide world. the chimney sweep tried to reason with her. all was quiet and they peeped out. alas his whole back had come off in a single piece and his head had rolled into a corner. asked she. then they climbed again up to the place where they had stood before. mended he was. am i to have her or am i not they were so afraid that he would nod his head. so fierce are these little creatures that they will tear off each others arms and legs without the least mercy and yet after their fashion they look merry and happy. he always liked to make the most of everything and when he could not manage it in the ordinary way he tried magic. accordingly he poured something that looked like a drop of red wine but which in reality was witchs blood upon the drop of water. immediately all the strange little creatures became red all over and looked for all the world like a whole town full of naked red indians. those that were under wanted to be at the top while those that chanced to be at the top must needs thrust themselves underneath. one seemed to be saying. another had a little lump behind his ear an innocent little lump enough but it seemed to pain him and therefore the others seemed determined that it should pain him more. the others would not have it so however. still it was quite large enough to admit of his marrying and he wished to marry. we shall see what this princess said. listen ah but that was a rose instead the rose tree with its beautiful rose came to view. said all the court ladies. the princess touched it and was ready to cry. remarked an old knight. said the emperor and at the remembrance he wept like a child. and she positively refused to see the prince. he stained his face brown and black pulled his cap over his ears and knocked at the door of the castle. this you see was something quite different from the rose. it was the only piece she knew and she played it with one finger. said the princess. so one of the court ladies had to go in but she drew on wooden slippers first. inquired the lady. exclaimed the maid of honor. asked the princess. so the lady whispered it. said the princess. the court ladies placed themselves in front of her and spread out their dresses. that was delightful the court ladies danced and clapped their hands. said the princess when she passed by. go in and ask him the price of the instrument. but when she had gone a little way she stopped again. asked the princess. he rubbed his eyes and put on his spectacles. cried the emperor for he was very angry. said the princess. he looked so noble that the princess could not help bowing before him. he then went back to his own little kingdom where he shut the door of his palace before her very eyes. in this street just in front of the market place where vegetables are sold stands a pig made of brass and curiously formed. it was late on a winter evening. in the garden of the grand dukes palace under the roof of one of the wings where a thousand roses bloom in winter a little ragged boy had been sitting the whole day long. no one was in the street but himself. it belonged only to him. he boldly seated himself on the pigs back leaned forward so that his curly head could rest on the head of the animal and before he was aware fell asleep. it was midnight. it was as if everything had life. the little boy said not a word. he was half pleased and half afraid. they entered a long gallery where the boy had been before. life and movement were in everything. as they passed from hall to hall beauty showed itself in whatever they saw and as the metal pig went step by step from one picture to another the little boy could see it all plainly. most beautiful is the expression on the faces of two children who appear to have full confidence that they shall reach heaven at last. on this picture the boys eyes rested longer than on any other and the metal pig stood still before it. a low sigh was heard. did it come from the picture or from the animal still from without and while you are upon my back i may look in through the open door. the wind whistled in his ears. it was morning. fear and trembling came upon him as he thought of his mother. she had sent him out the day before to get some money but he had not been able to get any and now he was hungry and thirsty. once more he clasped the neck of his metal steed kissed its nose and nodded farewell to it. a woman not very young with an unpleasant face and a quantity of black hair followed them. she asked when she saw the boy. then they went into a little room. this pot she took in her lap warmed her fingers and pushed the boy with her elbow. the boy began to cry and then she struck him till he cried aloud. then again she swung the fire pot about. the poor child ran till he was quite out of breath. at last he stopped at the church the doors of which were opened to him the night before and went in. towards evening he was awakened by a pull at his sleeve. he started up and the same old citizen stood before him. where do you live were some of the questions asked by the old man. after hearing his answers the old man took him to a small house in a back street close by. look what delicate fingers he has. he ate well and slept well and became very merry. this made the woman angry and she scolded him and threatened him which made him unhappy and he went and sat in his own room full of sad thoughts. that night he lay awake thinking of the metal pig. indeed it was always in his thoughts. he sprang out of bed and went to the window. could it be the metal pig but there was nothing to be seen. whatever he had heard had passed already. the poor boy smiled too for here was his heaven. asked the boy. but all day long his thoughts were in the picture gallery and so he pricked his fingers and was awkward. when evening came and the house door stood open he slipped out. away he went through the already deserted streets and soon came to the metal pig. he stooped down and kissed its shining nose and then seated himself on its back. a fiery dragon could not have frightened the little boy so much as did the little dog in this place. as the old lady called it. what would be the end of this the dog looked almost like a little kid when she was allowed to go out in winter and trot after her mistress. now here she was in the cold and not dressed. oh how would it end asked two of the police whom he met and at whom the dog barked. they asked and took it away from him. here was trouble indeed. they would certainly kill him he thought. and so he went home almost hoping for death. no one was in the street so he took up a stone and with it made a tremendous noise at the door. asked somebody from within. she cried. oh what beautiful pictures those were figures with funny heads and best of all the metal pig was there too. nothing could be more delightful oh if he could only draw and paint certainly it was rather crooked rather up and down one leg thick and another thin. a second pig was drawn by the side of the first and this looked a hundred times better. and just then her mistress walked in. was all she could utter. two pictures placed side by side attracted many people. the smaller of the two represented a little boy sitting at a table drawing. the boy had taught himself to draw. it was also said that a young artist now famous had discovered this talent in the child just as he was about to be sent away for having tied up madams favorite little dog to use as a model. the childs arms were round the neck of the pig and he was in a deep sleep. it was a beautiful picture. he did not do so he knew the value of money better than to use it in this way. in this manner he soon lost all his money. and now all his companions deserted him. but he had nothing left to pack therefore he seated himself in the trunk. it was a very wonderful trunk for no sooner did any one press on the lock than the trunk could fly. he shut the lid and pressed the lock when away flew the trunk up the chimney with him in it right up into the clouds. however he arrived safely in turkey. he hid the trunk in a wood under some dry leaves and then went into the town. he happened to meet a nurse with a little child. so he went back to the wood seated himself in his trunk flew up to the roof of the castle and crept through the window into the room where the princess lay asleep on the sofa. this pleased her very much. he related to her the story about the stork who brings the beautiful children from the rivers. these stories delighted the princess and when he asked her if she would marry him she consented immediately. but you must think of some very pretty stories to tell them for they like to hear stories better than anything. he flew away to the town and bought a new dressing gown and afterwards returned to the wood where he composed a story so as to be ready by saturday and that was no easy matter. it was ready however when he went to see the princess on saturday. whenever the sun shone we felt his warm rays and the little birds would relate stories to us in their songs. i am the first in this house when anything solid or useful is required. my only pleasure is to be made clean and shining after dinner and to sit in my place and have a little sensible conversation with my neighbors. we get our news from the market basket but it sometimes tells us very unpleasant things about the people and the government. yes and one day an old pot was so alarmed that it fell down and was broken in pieces. we will tell something that has happened to ourselves that will be very easy and interesting as well. said the plates. then how they danced and stuck one leg in the air the chair cushion in the corner burst with laughter at the sight. there was nothing remarkable about the pen except that it had been dipped too deeply in the ink but it was proud of that. theres a nightingale in a cage outside that can sing. she has not been taught much certainly but we need not say anything this evening about that. let the market basket decide what is right. would it not be more sensible to put the house in order if each were in his own place i would lead a game. this would be quite another thing. at the same moment the door opened and the maid came in. then not one stirred they remained quite still although there was not a single pot among them that had not a high opinion of himself and of what he could do if he chose. how we shine what a light we give said the queen. cakes and sweetmeats were thrown among the people. altogether it was a very splendid affair. it was very natural that he should wish to know. and what strange things people did say to be sure he heard many more fine things about himself and that the next day he was to be married. after this he went back to the forest to rest himself in his trunk. it had disappeared it was burned to ashes. so the merchants son could not fly any more nor go to meet his bride. the butterfly 
there was once a butterfly who wished for a bride and as may be supposed he wanted to choose a very pretty one from among the flowers. dearly very much a little and so on. each one speaks these words in his own language. pray tell me which of the flowers i shall choose for my wife. which will be my bride she was offended that he should call her a woman when she was only a girl there is a great difference. he asked her a second time and then a third but she remained dumb answering him not at all. then as young lads often do he looked out for the older girls. she was white and red graceful and slender and belonged to those domestic maidens who have a pretty appearance yet can be useful in the kitchen. he asked. and at once he flew away for he felt quite shocked. no he did not like her. but which one did he like spring went by and summer drew toward its close. autumn came but he had not decided. i am old and you are old but we may live for each other just the same. as to marrying however no and so it happened that the butterfly got no wife at all. it was not the weather for flying about in summer clothes but fortunately the butterfly was not out in it. by a happy chance he had got a shelter. he could live here he said well enough. they could not do more for him. one evening the student came into the shop through the back door to buy candles and cheese for himself he had no one to send and therefore he came himself. the student nodded also as he turned to leave then suddenly stopped and began reading the piece of paper in which the cheese was wrapped. it was a leaf torn out of an old book a book that ought not to have been torn up for it was full of poetry. it would be a sin to tear up a book like this. whatever object in the room he placed this tongue upon immediately received voice and speech and was able to express its thoughts and feelings as readily as the lady herself could do. it could only be used by one object at a time which was a good thing as a number speaking at once would have caused great confusion. with these words he went quietly up the back stairs to the garret where the student lived. but how light the room was each leaf was fresh and each flower was like a beautiful female head some with dark and sparkling eyes and others with eyes that were wonderfully blue and clear. the fruit gleamed like stars and the room was filled with sounds of beautiful music. he did not himself know why he wept yet a kind of pleasant feeling mingled with his tears. it was very cold but the little creature did not really feel it till the light in the garret went out and the tones of music died away. a great fire had broken out and the whole street seemed full of flames. was it in their house or a neighbors no one could tell for terror had seized upon all. all wished to keep the best things they had. he found him standing by the open window and looking quite calmly at the fire which was raging in the house of a neighbor opposite. the greatest treasure in the house was saved and he ran away with it to the roof and seated himself on the chimney. and then he laughed aloud at what he called his own wit and the rest joined with him. the whole party shouted and screamed and the dogs barked loudly. loud laughter mingled with the howling of dogs sounded through the open windows. the wine had mounted to their heads and the sense had flown out. as he stepped along he saw the little maiden keeping watch over the geese and she nodded to him in a friendly way. the little girl saw that the branch must have taken root and she was quite joyful about it. from that hour no more card playing was permitted there. it would be too long a story in these busy times to explain how all this came about but it really did happen and the most important part is to come. it was pleasant to live in the old court now. sometimes the wind from the sea scattered the willow leaves. a path led through the field close by the tree. the lawn was as fresh and green as if each separate blade of grass were cleaned morning and evening. there were tables with white marble tops and books bound in velvet and gold. therefore the pictures which were once the honor and glory of the old house now hung in the passage leading to the servants hall. they took the path through the fields which led past the old willow tree. she liked very much to hear him talk of the wonders of nature and of the great men and women of history. they laugh at me for it at home but i dont mind. my grandfather the first baron was their son. at home they all love him best but i scarcely know why. it is a coin which has received the impression of its own value. i feel that this is quite false. she was accustomed to come every sunday and always carried away a gift with her. and before my mother understood what he said he had left the room and run downstairs to the old woman. there was a large party at the hall that evening. a funeral party it certainly was not however it was meant for a party of pleasure but the pleasure was yet to come. it was pronounced a failure. you are a universal genius i hear and genius is quite the rage nowadays nothing like genius. it was easy to see that these people wanted to make fun of him and he refused to play. there they sat together for all the world like bride and bridegroom. next day no more was said about the adventure than as if it had never happened. their value had not been known before. so shall it be all in good time never fear. not in this world perhaps. that would be expecting rather too much. the real princess 
there was once a prince who wanted to marry a princess. but she must be a real princess mind you. so he traveled all round the world seeking such a one but everywhere something was in the way. not that there was any lack of princesses but he could not seem to make out whether they were real princesses there was always something not quite satisfactory. therefore home he came again quite out of spirits for he wished so much to marry a real princess. one evening a terrible storm came on. in the midst of it there came a knock at the town gate and the old king went out to open it. it was a princess who stood outside. but o dear what a state she was in from the rain and bad weather the princess lay upon this bed all the night. in the morning she was asked how she had slept. she said. i cannot think what there could have been in the bed. i lay upon something so hard that i am quite black and blue all over. none but a real princess could have such delicate feeling. so the prince took her for his wife for he knew that in her he had found a true princess. and this mind you is a real story. the emperors new clothes 
many years ago there was an emperor who was so fond of new clothes that he spent all his money on them. life was merry and gay in the town where the emperor lived and numbers of strangers came to it every day. i should distinguish wise men from fools. he believed indeed that he had nothing to fear for himself but still he thought it better to send some one else first to see how the work was coming on. all the people in the town had heard of the peculiar property of the stuff and every one was curious to see how stupid his neighbor might be. thought the old man opening his eyes wide. but he took care not to say so aloud. thought the old man. i have never thought it and nobody must know it. is it true that i am not fit for my office asked the one who was pretending to go on with his work. to all of this the minister paid great attention so that he might be able to repeat it to the emperor when he went back to him. the same thing happened with him as with the minister. everybody in the town was talking of the splendid cloth. thought the emperor. this is terrible am i a fool am i not fit to be emperor they even suggested to the emperor that he wear the splendid new clothes for the first time on the occasion of a great procession which was soon to take place. gorgeous went from mouth to mouth. here are the trousers here is the coat this they said was the train and the emperor turned round and round before the mirror. cried all the courtiers in turn. they would not let it be noticed that they could see and feel nothing. what a splendid train no one wanted to let it appear that he could see nothing for that would prove him not fit for his post. none of the emperors clothes had been so great a success before. said a little child. the emperor was startled by this for he had a suspicion that they were right. great claus and little claus 
in a village there once lived two men of the same name. both of them were called claus. but because one of them owned four horses while the other had but one people called the one who had the four horses big or great claus and the one who owned but a single horse little claus. now i shall tell you what happened to each of them for this is a true story. how little claus would crack his whip over the five for they were as good as his own on that one day. the sun shone brightly and the church bells rang merrily as the people passed by. cried little claus and he began to weep. then he put the dried skin into a bag and hanging it over his shoulder went off to the next town to sell it. he had a very long way to go and was obliged to pass through a great gloomy wood. a dreadful storm came up. he lost his way and before he found it again evening was drawing on. so he went up to the door and knocked. the door was opened by the farmers wife but when he explained what it was that he wanted she told him to go away her husband she said was not at home and she could not let any strangers in. a stork was just then standing near his nest on the house roof. so little claus climbed onto the roof of the shed and proceeded to make himself comfortable. he could look over them straight into the room in which a large table was laid with wine roast meat and a fine great fish. goodness what a glorious feast they had before them. at that moment some one came riding down the road towards the farm. it was the farmer himself returning. the woman hid the wine and all the good things in the oven for if her husband were to see them he would certainly ask why they had been provided. asked the farmer looking up where little claus was. then little claus told him how he had lost his way and asked if he might have shelter for the night. the wife received them both in a friendly way and laid the table bringing to it a large bowl of porridge. the farmer was hungry and ate with a good appetite. but little claus could not help thinking of the capital roast meat fish and cake which he knew were hidden in the oven. he had put his sack with the hide in it under the table by his feet for we must remember he was on his way to the town to sell it. asked the farmer. the farmers wife did not say a word but set the food before them and they both made a hearty meal of the fish the meat and the cake. inquired the farmer. so the woman was obliged to bring the wine which she had hidden and the farmer and little claus became right merry. inquired the farmer. however it doesnt matter for i know hes a demon and i shant mind so much. now my courage is up the farmer opened the lid a wee little way and peeped in. they must needs drink after this and there they sat till far into the night. said the farmer and he went on begging for him. i wont have it in the house an hour longer. on the other side of the forest was a wide deep river whose current was so strong that it was almost impossible to swim against it. ill just throw it into the river. and he took hold of the chest and lifted it a little as if he were going to throw it into the river. said little claus pretending to be frightened. said great claus and he ran off at once to little claus. he asked. he cried through the streets. they all said. they called after him. little clauss old grandmother had just died in his house. he took the dead woman and laid her in his warm bed to see if she would not come to life again. he himself intended to sit in a corner all night. he had slept that way before. he knew where little clauss bed stood and he went straight to it and hit the dead grandmother a blow on the forehead thinking it was little claus. said little claus. what a good thing that poor grandmother was dead already then he started off through the woods. when the sun rose he was just outside a big inn and he drew up his horse and went in to get something to eat. shes sitting out there in the cart i cant get her to come in. wont you take her out a glass of beer cried he as loud as he could. but the dead woman replied not a word and at last he became quite angry and threw the beer in her face and at that moment she fell backwards out of the cart for she was only set upright and not bound fast. so he took the measure over to little claus himself. asked he his eyes big and round with amazement at what he saw. great claus was so frightened that he rushed out of the shop jumped into his cart whipped up his horse and galloped home through the wood. directly after he got home great claus took the biggest sack he could find and went over to little claus. it was a long way that he had to travel before he came to the river and little claus was not light to carry. the road came close to the church and the people within were singing beautifully. great claus put down his sack with little claus in it at the church door. so he went in. then little claus tied it up and went his way driving the cows and the oxen. in a little while great claus came out of the church. cried he. asked great claus. im a very rich man i can tell you. i sank to the bottom immediately but i did not hurt myself for the grass is beautifully soft down there. here are cattle for you and a mile further up the road there is another herd down at the bottom of it they walk directly from the sea straight into the land where the river ends. lovely flowers and beautiful fresh grass were there. the fishes which swam there glided about me like birds in the air. asked great claus. you know i told you that the mermaid said there was a whole herd of cattle for me a mile further up the stream. cried great claus. said great claus. and so they went together to the river. when the cows and oxen saw the water they ran to it as fast as they could. cried little claus. he then crept into a big sack which had been lying across the back of one of the cows. plump and there lay great claus in the river. he sank at once to the bottom. there he stands     with his nasty hair and hands. see cruel frederick 
here is cruel frederick see far worse than all beside     he whipped his mary till she cried. so frederick had to go to bed
his leg was very sore and red mamma and nurse went out one day     and left her all alone at play. she jumped for joy and ran about     and was too pleased to put it out. and see oh what dreadful thing they screamed for help twas all in vain so she was burnt with all her clothes     and arms and hands and eyes and nose     till she had nothing more to lose     except her little scarlet shoes     and nothing else but these was found     among her ashes on the ground. and when the good cats sat beside     the smoking ashes how they cried their tears ran down their cheeks so fast     they made a little pond at last. but ah see there they are and there they run he finds it hard without a pair     of spectacles to shoot the hare. now as the sun grew very hot     and he a heavy gun had got     he lay down underneath a tree     and went to sleep as you may see. and while he slept like any top     the little hare came hop hop hop     took gun and spectacles and then     on her hind legs went off again. fire help the hare the hare stopped short took aim and hark there lived close by the cottage there     the hares own child the little hare     and while she stood upon her toes     the coffee fell and burned her nose. oh children see snap oh snap he ate and drank as he was told     and never let his soup get cold. o take the nasty soup away the third day comes oh what a sin to make himself so pale and thin. look at him now the fourth days come see the naughty restless child     growing still more rude and wild     till his chair falls over quite. and papa made such a face fairly covered up you see cloth and all are lying on him     he has pulled down all upon him. here a knife and there a fork table all so bare and ah poor papa and poor mamma     look quite cross and wonder how     they shall have their dinner now. once with head as high as ever     johnny walked beside the river. oh what fun johnny watched the bright round sun     going in and coming out     this was all he thought about. so he strode on only think one step more oh sad to tell oh you should have seen him shiver     when they pulled him from the river. dripping wet and such a fright wet all over everywhere     clothes and arms and face and hair

when the rain comes tumbling down     in the country or the town     all good little girls and boys     stay at home and mind their toys. here you see him silly fellow     underneath his red umbrella. what a wind oh soon they got to such a height     they were nearly out of sight. and the hat went up so high     that it nearly touched the sky. she got up and trotted away into the wood behind her mothers house and it was such a warm pleasant day that she wandered on and on until she came into a part of the wood where she had never been before. now in this wood there lived a family of three bears. goldilocks stopped when she came to the bears house and began to wonder who lived there. goldilocks was rather hungry after her walk and the soup smelt so good that she began to wish the people of the house would come home and invite her to have some. when she had finished her dinner she noticed three chairs standing by the wall. one was a great big chair and she climbed upon that and sat down. oh dear how hard it was it was so comfortable that she sat on and on until if youll believe it she actually sat the bottom out. then of course she was comfortable no longer so she got up and began to wonder what she should do next. there was a staircase in the bears house and goldilocks thought she would go up it and see where it led to. goldilocks was sleepy so she thought she would lie down and have a little nap. but oh dear me how cross the great big bear looked when he saw his spoon had been used and thrown under the table. he cried in a great big voice. by this time the bears were sure that someone had been in their house quite lately so they looked about to see if someone were not there still. there was certainly no one downstairs so they went up the staircase to their bedroom. oh how frightened she was when she saw the three bears standing beside her. she hopped out of bed and in a second was out through the open window. never stopping to wonder if the fall had hurt her she got up and ran and ran and ran until she could go no farther always thinking that the bears were close behind her. and when at length she fell down in a heap on the ground because she was too tired to run any more it was her own mother who picked her up because in her fright she had run straight home without knowing it. cinderella 
once upon a time there lived a noble gentleman who had one dear little daughter. poor child her own kind mother was dead and her father who loved her very dearly was afraid that his little girl was sometimes lonely. so he married a grand lady who had two daughters of her own and who he thought would be kind and good to his little one. but no sooner did the stepmother enter her new home than she began to show her true character. the sisters fine clothes made cinderella feel very shabby but in her little torn frock and ragged shoes she was a thousand times more lovely than they. now it chanced that the kings son gave a grand ball to which he invited all the lords and ladies in the country and amongst the rest cinderellas two sisters were asked. how pleased and excited they were when the invitation arrived for days they could talk of nothing but the clothes they should wear and the grand folk they hoped to meet. said one of them. the sisters burst out laughing. cried a silvery voice. cinderella started and raised her eyes. who could it be then in a moment she knew it was her fairy godmother cinderella nodded. cinderella could not imagine how a pumpkin could help her to go to the ball but her only thought was to obey her godmother. in a few moments she was back again with a splendid pumpkin. cinderella was so excited that she could scarcely speak. then suddenly she thought of her shabby frock. ah who can describe a robe made by the fairies surely it was a dream and now child go and enjoy yourself to your hearts content. a few moments later the coach dashed into the royal courtyard the door was flung open and cinderella alighted. here she found her godmother waiting to hear all about the ball. she put her arms round her godmothers neck and kissed and thanked her. but the hours flew by so happily and so swiftly that cinderella forgot her promise until she happened to look at a clock and saw that it was on the stroke of twelve. poor little cinderella when they came in they could speak of nothing but the wonderful things that had happened at the ball. the beautiful princess had been there again they said but had disappeared just as the clock struck twelve and though the prince had searched everywhere for her he had been unable to find her. once more she stood in the slippers and once more the sisters saw before them the lovely princess who was to be the princes bride. for at the touch of the magic shoes the little gray frock disappeared for ever and in place of it she wore the beautiful robe the fairy godmother had given to her. the prince could not bear to part from his little love again so he carried her back to the palace in his grand coach and they were married that very day. the three brothers 
there was once a man who had three sons but no fortune except the house he lived in. now each of them wanted to have the house after his death but their father was just as fond of one as of the other and did not know how to treat them all fairly. they fixed a time when they would all meet at home again and then they set off. it so happened that they each found a clever master with whom they learned their business thoroughly. suddenly a hare came running over the field. before long a gentleman came along in his carriage at full gallop. then as they had been so fond of one another they were all buried in one grave. he found the king and queen absent and peeping into the nest he saw five or six young birds lying in it. nobody answered. as soon as the other beasts saw this they thought all was lost and began to run each one to his own hole so the birds won the battle without difficulty. rejoice said he. the fox and the cat 
it happened once that the cat met mr. fox in the wood and because she thought he was clever and experienced in all the ways of the world she addressed him in a friendly manner. what has come into your head how dare you ask me how i am getting on what sort of education have you had asked the fox. said the fox. but i pity you. this match however brilliant as it was seemed not to the mothers taste. to the stars no death would be better a thousand times. when the sausage came home she found the house lonely and silent. but no one answered. found within the pot her good little friend who had perished at the post of duty. johnny and the golden goose 
there was once a man who had three sons. johnny the youngest was always looked upon as the simpleton of the family and had very little consideration or kindness shown him. then he left the little gray man standing in the road and went on his way. there was no rich cake for the simpleton of the family. no sooner did he reach the wood than the little gray man appeared. said he. so the two sat down together but when johnny took his humble fare from his pocket what was his surprise to find it changed into the most delicious cake and wine. the old man then nodded kindly and disappeared in a moment. he lifted it carefully out and carried it with him to the inn where he meant to spend the night. the eldest made up her mind to wait for a good opportunity and then pluck a feather for herself. very soon the second sister came creeping into the room meaning also to steal a feather but no sooner did she touch her sister than she too was unable to draw her hand away. screamed her two sisters but she could not understand why she should not help herself as well as the others. so she paid no heed to their cries but came toward them and stretched out her hand to the goose. in doing so she touched her second sister and then alas she too was held fast. wherever he led they were bound to follow. half way across a sunny meadow they met the parson who was terribly shocked to see the three girls running after a young man. he cried angrily and seized the youngest by the hand to drag her away. but no sooner did he touch her than the poor parson was made fast too and had to run behind the girls whether he would or no. on and on they ran until at length they came into the country of a powerful king. this king had an only daughter who all her life had been so sad that no one had ever been able to make her laugh. johnny at once remembered the little gray man and feeling sure that he would help him he set out for the wood where he had first met him. you can think how pleased johnny was to hear these words. so the young man had no choice but to set out once more for the wood. and again he found a man sitting beside the stump of the tree. said johnny. he led the man into the courtyard of the kings palace where all the meal in the kingdom had been collected together and mixed into an enormous mountain of bread. the man from the wood placed himself in front of it and began to eat and before the day was over the mountain of bread had vanished. a third time the simpleton demanded his bride but again the king found an excuse. it was i you know who drank the wine and ate the bread for you and now i will finish by giving you the wonderful ship which is to sail on either land or sea. then he gave him the ship and when the king saw it he could find no further excuse. so he gave the young man his daughter and the pair were married that very day. so the stool hopped. so the broom began to sweep. then the old form ran round the house. now one day this teenytiny woman put on her teenytiny bonnet and went out of her teenytiny house to take a teenytiny walk. so the teenytiny woman put the teenytiny bone into her teenytiny pocket and went home to her teenytiny house. now when the teenytiny woman got home to her teenytiny house she was a teenytiny tired so she went up her teenytiny stairs to her teenytiny bed and put the teenytiny bone into a teenytiny cupboard. and this teenytiny woman was a teenytiny frightened so she hid her teenytiny head under the teenytiny clothes and went to sleep again. this made the teenytiny woman a teenytiny more frightened so she hid her teenytiny head a teenytiny farther under the teenytiny clothes. and went on shaking till all its leaves fell off. now the king of the country heard of this lad but he would not believe what was said about him so the boy was ordered to come to court. asked the boy. but nobody was able. at last the mother in a fit of impatience gave her a blow which made the girl cry out loudly. the mother rejoiced greatly in her heart and the queen took the maiden home with her. when they arrived in the castle she led her up into three rooms which were piled from top to bottom with the finest flax. when she was left alone she began to weep and thus she sat for three days without stirring a finger. but when the maiden was once more alone she did not know what to do or how to help herself and in her distress she went to the window and looked out. they stopped under the window and looking up asked the maiden what was the matter. then she admitted the three strange women and making a clear space in the first room they sat themselves down and began spinning. when the first room was empty the second was commenced and when that was finished the third was begun and very soon cleared. the bridegroom rejoiced that he had won so clever and industrious a wife and he praised her exceedingly. so the queen and the bridegroom consented. but alas asked the mouse. what do you mean the mouse however again asked what name the third child had received. i have never yet seen it in print. and shaking her head she rolled herself up and went to sleep. so they set out on their journey and when they arrived at the church the pot stood in its old place but it was empty cried the cat. this happens every day in the world. the sweet soup 
once on a time there was a poor but very good little girl who lived alone with her mother and when my story begins they had nothing in the house to eat. so the child went out into the forest and there she met an old woman who already knew her distress and who presented her with a pot which had the following power. it would immediately cease to boil. so it began to cook and she soon ate all she wished but when the poor woman wanted to have the pot stop she found she did not know the word. away therefore the pot boiled and very quickly was over the edge and as it boiled and boiled the kitchen presently became full then the house and the next house and soon the whole street. it seemed likely to satisfy all the world for though there was the greatest necessity to do so nobody knew how to stop it. immediately it ceased to boil but whoever wishes to enter the village now must eat his way through the soup one day she had a dish of beans which she wanted to cook for dinner so she made a fire on the hearth and in order that it should burn up quickly she lighted it with a handful of straw. she hung the pot over the fire and poured in the beans but one fell on to the floor without her noticing it and rolled away beside a piece of straw. soon afterwards a live coal flew out of the fire and joined their company. then the straw began to speak. said the coal. this suggestion pleased both the straw and the coal so away they all went at once. half way across she hesitated and began to feel afraid of the rushing water beneath her. she dared go no farther but neither would she return but she stood there so long that the straw caught fire broke in two and fell into the stream. of course the coal was bound to follow. but when he saw what very queer figures his friends cut he could not help laughing. he laughed and laughed till he could not stop and at length he split his side. it would have gone badly with him then had not a tailor happened to pass by. stop a minute demanded the bear. so the bear had a mind to learn to fish too and bade the fox tell him how he was to set about it. youve only got to go upon the ice and cut a hole and stick your tail down through it and hold it there as long as you can. one day she called her sons to her and with tears in her eyes told them that she must send them out into the wide world to seek their fortune. the man was very goodnatured so he gave him the bundle of straw and the little pig built a pretty little house with it. said the wolf. said the little pig. cried the little pig. said the little pig. the next day the wolf came again and told the little pig that there was going to be a fair in the town that afternoon and asked him if he would go with him. the wolf could not think what the strange thing rolling down the hill could be so he turned tail and ran away home in a fright without ever going to the fair at all. he went to the little pigs house to tell him how frightened he had been by a large round thing which came rolling past him down the hill. this made the wolf so angry that he declared that he would eat up the little pig and that nothing should save him for he would jump down the chimney. but the clever little pig hung a pot full of water over the hearth and then made a blazing fire and just as the wolf was coming down the chimney he took off the cover and in fell the wolf. in a second the little pig had popped the lid on again. then he boiled the wolf and ate him for supper and after that he lived quietly and comfortably all his days and was never troubled by a wolf again. you parents all that children have     and you too that have none   if you would have them safe abroad     pray keep them safe at home. oh so they took it away and were married next day     by the turkey who lives on the hill. let him sing his happy song   nor do these gentle creatures wrong. suppose my little lady     your doll should break her head   could you make it whole by crying     till your eyes and nose are red up above the world so high   like a diamond in the sky. then you shall have no pie. no you shall have no pie. but i smell a rat close by           hush hush when she was good   she was very very good     and when she was bad she was horrid. dont you wish that you were me you have curious things to eat   i am fed on proper meat   you must dwell beyond the foam   but i am safe and live at home. dont you wish that you were me when children are happy and lonely and good   the friend of the children comes out of the wood. nobody heard him and nobody saw   his is a picture you never could draw   but hes sure to be present abroad or at home   when children are happy and playing alone. pray whither sailed those ships all three     on christmas day on christmas day pray whither sailed those ships all three     on christmas day in the morning and all the bells on earth shall ring     on christmas day on christmas day   and all the bells on earth shall ring     on

        try again. we sailed along for days and days   and had the very best of plays   but tom fell out and hurt his knee   so there was no one left but me. though she saw him there like a ball of light   for she knew he had gods time to keep   all over the world and never could sleep. i saw the different things you did   but always you yourself you hid. are you a beast of field and tree   or just a stronger child than me said the spider to the fly. alas alas poor foolish thing glory to the father     glory to the son   and to thee blessed spirit     whilst all ages run. what will become of us now the two children had been too hungry to go to sleep that night and so it happened that they overheard all that their parents were saying. gretel wept bitterly but brave little hansel did his best to comfort her. he stooped and filled his pockets as full as he could and then went back to gretel and once more bidding her be comforted for god would be sure to watch over them he jumped into bed and they both fell fast asleep. she gave them each a piece of bread for their dinner and told them to be sure not to eat it too soon for they would get nothing more. but what they heard was only a dry branch which the man had bound to a tree so that the wind swung it hither and thither and the noise it made deceived the children. when they awoke the night was very dark and gretel was frightened and began to cry. hansel put his arms around her and whispered. in a short time they were as badly off as ever and one night they again heard their mother trying to persuade her husband to take them out into the wood and lose them. but the man would not agree. his wife would not listen to what he said but scolded him for his want of thought for her and at last the poor man gave way a second time just as he had done at first. deeper and deeper into the wood they went where the children had never been before. the evening shadows fell but still no one came to fetch the poor children and it was not until midnight that they awakened. hansel put his arms round his sister and told her not to fear for when the moon rose they would easily be able to see the crumbs and so find their way home again. so when the moon rose they set out upon their way but alas there were no crumbs to be seen for the little birds that lived in the green wood were as hungry as the children and had eaten them all up. when at length the weary little feet could go no farther the children lay down beneath a tree and slept. on the third day they were still as far away as ever and it seemed to them that the longer they walked the deeper they got into the wood and they began to be afraid that they would die of cold and hunger. the children followed him until they reached a little house on the roof of which he perched. the children were so frightened that they dropped their food and clung to each other. whenever anyone came into her power she cooked and ate him and thought what a fine feast she had had. early in the morning before the children were awake she stood beside them and admired their rosy cheeks and soft round limbs. the tears chased each other down gretels cheeks as she carried in the water and she sobbed aloud in her grief. alas but gretel guessed that the old witch meant to shut the door upon her and roast her so she pretended that she did not know how to get in. as she spoke she popped her head into the oven. oh quick as thought gretel ran to her brother. hansel flew from his prison as a bird from its cage and the two happy little children kissed each other and jumped for joy. so off they ran and never stopped until they came to a lake upon which swam a large white duck. the duck came at once and taking hansel upon her back carried him over to the other side and then did the same for gretel. they went merrily on their way and very soon they found themselves in a part of the wood they knew quite well. oh how pleased he was to see them once again for he had not known a happy hour since he had left them alone in the wood. so now their troubles were at an end for the cruel stepmother was dead and hansel and gretel and their father lived together happily ever after. the wolf and the fox 
a wolf once upon a time caught a fox. asked the fox. and then ran away. said the fox. the wolf replied that he would go with him on condition that he helped him if he could not escape. said the fox and showed him the tricks and ways by which they could get into the cellar. the fox too had a taste but kept looking round while eating and ran frequently to the hole by which they had entered to see if his body would slip through it easily. the wolf said he would not leave till the cask was quite empty and meanwhile the peasant who had heard the noise made by the fox entered the cellar. hans came to grethel. grethel presented hans with a needle. hans took the needle stuck it in a load of hay and walked home behind the wagon. hans came to grethel. grethel gave hans a knife. hans took the knife put it in his sleeve and went home. hans came to grethel. grethel gave hans a young goat. hans took the goat tied its legs and put it in his pocket. hans came to grethel. grethel gave hans a piece of bacon. hans took the bacon tied it with a rope and swung it to and fro so that the dogs came and ate it up. when he reached home he held the rope in his hand but there was nothing on it. hans came to grethel. grethel gave hans a calf. hans took the calf set it on his head and the calf scratched his face. hans came to grethel. and after that grethel became hanss wife. puss in boots 
once upon a time there was a miller who was so poor that at his death he had nothing to leave to his three children but his mill his ass and his cat. the eldest son took the mill and the second the ass so there was nothing left for poor jack but to take puss. the cat who had overheard his young master jumped upon his shoulder and rubbing himself gently against his cheek began to speak. day by day puss brought home stores of good food so that he and his master lived in plenty and besides that he did not fail to keep the king and his courtiers well supplied with game. at length puss decided that it was time for his master to be introduced at court. the king and his daughter were so pleased with his appearance that they invited him into their carriage. at first jack hesitated for he felt a little shy about sitting next to a princess but she smiled at him so sweetly and was so kind and gentle that he soon forgot his fears and fell in love with her there and then. now the king was in a very good humor for the day was fine and he found the marquis a very pleasant companion so he told the coachman to drive slowly in order that he might admire the beautiful country. he said presently. and it was the same with everything they passed. the marquis listened with the greatest astonishment and thought what a very wonderful cat his dear puss was and the king was delighted to find that his new friend was as wealthy as he was charming. full of surprise the king turned to the marquis. he asked. jack or the marquis as he was now called gave his hand to the young princess and led her to the banquet. i only wish you could have seen him. at evening he cut out the shoes which he intended to begin upon the next morning and since he had a good conscience he lay down quietly said his prayers and fell asleep. in the morning when he had prayed as usual and was preparing to sit down to work he found the pair of shoes standing finished on his table. he was amazed and could not understand it in the least. he took the shoes in his hand to examine them more closely. the wife agreed lighted a candle and they hid themselves in the corner of the room behind the clothes which were hanging there. they did not stop till everything was quite finished and stood complete on the table then they ran swiftly away. the husband agreed and at evening when they had everything ready they laid out the presents on the table and hid themselves to see how the little men would behave. then they hopped and danced about and leaped over chairs and tables and out at the door. and he gave hans a piece of gold as big as his head. hans pulled out his handkerchief wrapped up the lump of gold in it and throwing it over his shoulder made his way home. said hans. hans was heartily delighted as he sat on his horse and rode gaily along. the horse broke into a smart trot and before hans was aware he was thrown off splash the horse too would have run away had it not been stopped by a peasant as he came along the road driving his cow before him. hans pulled himself together and got upon his legs again. you dont catch me on his back again. hans gladly consented and the peasant flung himself on the horse and rode quickly off. i have just to get a bit of bread and that isnt a difficult matter and then as often as i like i can eat my butter and cheese with it. if i am thirsty i just milk my cow and drink. when he came to an inn he made a stop and in his great joy ate all the food he had with him right up both dinner and supper. then he drove his cow towards his mothers village. cried he helping our friend hans to rise. hans told him what had happened. said hans running his fingers through his hair. but i dont think much of cows flesh it is not tender enough. now if one had a young pig said hans and at once gave him the cow. just then up came a youth carrying a fine white goose under his arm. meanwhile the lad was looking thoughtfully around shaking his head. i fear it is the one you have. they have sent people out and it would be a bad business if they found you with the pig. he said to himself. said hans. answered hans. hans raised the stone and marched on with a joyful heart his eyes shining with pleasure. at length he could only proceed with great trouble and must needs stop every minute the stones too crushed him terribly. with a bright heart and free from all care he sprang upon his way until he was home at his mothers. when she got there he told her that he had something to teach her for that in his house he had his own names for things. pointing to his bed. pointing to the cat. he went on pointing to the water. asked he as he pointed to the house. thats all. but good advice was scarce and in vain the president called upon all the most experienced mice present to find a way. with those paws she can tread so lightly that we cant hear her coming. the president declared that no one could be better fitted for the task than he who had given such excellent advice. he was too young for the deed he said. he didnt know the cat well enough. his grandfather who knew her better would be more suited to the job. but the grandfather declared that just because he knew the cat very well he would take good care not to attempt such a task. she was so pretty and so good that the sun seemed to shine more brightly when its light fell upon her rosy little face and the birds would seem to sing more sweetly when she was passing by. now this let me tell you before i forget was at the time when all the birds and beasts or very nearly all could speak just as well as you or i and nobody was surprised to hear them talk as i suppose one would be nowadays. but as she got deeper into the forest she walked more slowly. said the wolf as he walked beside her. cried he. well we shall see presently. oh so everything turned out right in the end and all lived happily ever after but i promise you that little red ridinghood never made friends with a wolf again she was very poor for times had been hard and jack was too young to work. for some time he went along very sadly but after a little he quite recovered his spirits. said the butcher. he said. cried jack who was so delighted with the bargain that he ran all the way home to tell his mother how lucky he had been. but oh how disappointed the poor widow was. she cried and she was so angry that she threw the beans out of the window into the garden. so poor jack went to bed without any supper and cried himself to sleep. when he woke up the next morning the room was almost dark and jack jumped out of bed and ran to the window to see what was the matter. a little way off there was a great castle with a broad road leading straight up to the front gate. but what most surprised jack was to find a beautiful maiden suddenly standing beside him. but he soon found that she knew a great deal more about him than his name for she told him how when he was quite a little baby his father a gallant knight had been slain by the giant who lived in yonder castle and how his mother in order to save jack had been obliged to promise never to tell the secret. as he drew near to the castle he saw the giants wife standing at the door. so in jack went and the giants wife gave him a good breakfast but before he had half finished it there came a terrible knock at the front door which seemed to shake even the thick walls of the castle. so he sat down and ate up the greater part of the ox. so his wife brought him two full bags of gold and the giant began to count his money. jack and his mother were now quite rich but it occurred to him one day that he would like to see how matters were going on at the giants castle. said the giant and the hen at once laid a golden egg. said the giant a second time and she laid another golden egg. said the giant a third time and she laid a third golden egg. the little brown hen laid so many golden eggs that jack and his mother had now more money than they could spend. this time you may be sure he was careful not to be seen so he crept round to the back of the castle and when the giants wife went out he slipped into the kitchen and hid himself in the oven. but of course jack was in the oven all the time down came the giant with a terrible crash and that you may be sure was the end of him. but jack and his mother grew very rich and lived happy ever after. how to tell a true princess 
there was once upon a time a prince who wanted to marry a princess but she must be a true princess. so he traveled through the whole world to find one but there was always something against each. there were plenty of princesses but he could not find out if they were true princesses. so he came home again in very low spirits for he had wanted very much to have a true princess. it was fearful there was a knocking heard at the palace gate and the old king went to open it. the water was running down from her hair and her dress into the points of her shoes and out at the heels again. and yet she said she was a true princess thought the old queen. and this was the bed in which the princess was to sleep. the next morning she was asked how she had slept. said the princess. i am sure i dont know what was in the bed. i lay on something so hard that my whole body is black and blue. so the prince married her for now he knew that at last he had got hold of a true princess. now this is a true story. there was everything there that heart could wish except just one and that was the one thing in all the world that this king and queen wanted to make them perfectly happy. for there was no little child to run and play about the sunny gardens and pick the flowers and pet the birds and beasts that wandered there. and this would often make them very sad. not that they are greedy but they are used to such delicate food that even the very best of ours seems strange to them. they were all good fairies and had known the king and queen all their lives long and as they had not seen them for some time there was a great deal to talk about and much news to tell. and dear me how pleased they were with the baby for each one of them there was a set of six golden dinner things knife spoon fork cup dish and plate made on purpose as a present for each and all different. the poor queen had been so happy and so busy that she had forgotten all about her and never sent her an invitation. it was all in vain. said the princess. the old woman neither answered nor looked up for of course she did not hear. so the princess stepped into the room and laid her hand upon the old womans shoulder. cried she in a high cracked voice. immediately a deep silence fell on all around. below in the castle it was just the same. this sudden darkness had been caused by a magic wood which had sprung up all around the palace and its grounds. well and so the years went on and on and on until a hundred years had passed and the palace and the story of it were all but forgotten. and it happened that a kings son from a neighboring country came hunting that way with his men and horses and dogs. and in the excitement of the chase he rode on and on until he became separated from his servants and attendants and found himself in a part of the country where he had never been before. an old old man lived in this hut and after he had directed the prince as to the best way back the young man pointed to a thick wood ahead and asked what lay beyond it. but he was strong and brave and after a time the way became easier until at last he came to the palace. she was so beautiful that to see her almost took away his breath and falling on his knees he bent to kiss her cheek. prince have you come at last and all at the same time the whole palace was awake. everything in short went on exactly as though the spell had lasted a hundred seconds instead of years. but that gave them something to laugh at. so all ended well and what more could anyone wish through if you wanted em to 
  some actual facts that might interest you aint you sorry for him eyes what a singular thing i know ho why certainly so what a pity that is and his toes have worked round where his heels ought to be. what a marvelous man so limb theres no use in saying she isnt with a crack like that in her head. why just suppose it was you you might make her look all mended but what do i care for looks my dolly my own little daughter i know that i did it myself i think you must be crazy youll get her another head what good would forty heads do her i tell you my dolly is dead and to think i hadnt quite finished her elegant new spring hat and i took a sweet ribbon of hers last night to tie on that horrid cat but i know that she knew it now and i just believe i do   that her poor little heart was broken and so her head broke too. oh my baby my little baby i wish my head had been hit for ive hit it over and over and it hasnt cracked a bit. unknown 
 
the voice of spring 
  i am coming i am coming hark hark look around thee look around said a little lark. unknown 
 
thanksgiving day 
  over the river and through the wood     to grandfathers house we go       the horse knows the way       to carry the sleigh     through the white and drifted snow. over the river and through the wood 
    oh how the wind does blow hurrah for thanksgiving day for this is thanksgiving day. over the river and through the wood 
    now grandmothers cap i spy hurrah for the fun is the pudding done the jolly old miller how he will laugh     till the tears fill both his eyes and do not play at anything. there in the night where none can spy   all in my hunters camp i lie   and play at books that i have read   till it is time to go to bed. to the top of the porch to the top of the wall as i drew in my head and was turning around   down the chimney st. nicholas came with a bound. but thats quite absurd for have you not heard     much tongue and few brains are connected   that they are supposed to think least who talk most     and their wisdom is always suspected there was a crow sat on a stone   when he was gone then there was none. there was an old wife did eat an apple   when she had eat two she had eat a couple. there was a horse going to the mill   when he went on he stood not still. he passed again and lo o word of love ye were but little at the first     but mighty at the last. theres a good time coming boys     a good time coming
  and a poor mans family   shall not be his misery     in the good time coming. every child shall be a help     to make his right arm stronger   the happier he the more he has 
    wait a little longer. a man goes riding by   late at night when the fires are out   why does he gallop and gallop about by at the gallop he goes and then   by he comes back at the gallop again. ah hark the lark 
  hark hark he hasnt got a notion of how children ought to play   and can only make a fool of me in every sort of way. now for a leap they that with smiles lit up the hall     and cheered with song the hearth   alas for love shall we not seek it and weep no more or wheres the town go far or near   that does not find a rival here the voice must be fine       of a bird so divine   ah let me just hear it pray do. the creatures neither one nor t other. he said then full before their sight   produced the beast and lo t was white. where are your berries child all scattered by my side   i picked my empty basket up     and down i sat and cried. and he is not come home. and long before the sun was hot     and the summer mist had cleared   beside the good old grandmother     the willing child appeared. she did not wander up and down     nor yet a live branch pull   but steadily of the fallen boughs     she picked her apron full. and soon as she thought this thought     she heard a coming sound   as if a thousand fairy folk     were gathering all around. he called his child no voice replied     he searched with terror wild   blood blood he found on every side     but nowhere found his child good morning the coward slave we pass him by     we dare be poor for a that. he thought to find riches and lost the little he had. so with a smile the lion let him off. one that escaped ran off to his mother with the dreadful news. the old frog made one more trial determined to be as big as the ox and burst herself indeed. do you reach forth and draw them out. let me see green suits me yes it shall be green. moral. when he began to go about again he found that every one looked down upon or laughed at him. of what use are they believe me we are far better without them. cut off your tails my friends and you will see how much more comfortable it is. the wolf in sheeps clothing 
a wolf put on the skin of a sheep and getting in among the flock by means of this disguise killed many of the sheep. then he showed them their mistake and they praised the justice of the deed he had done. but this he was not strong enough to do. the man his son and his ass 
a man and his son were leading their ass to market. on hearing this the man set his son upon the ass. thereupon the man made his son get down and rode himself. hearing this the man took his son up beside him and so they rode into the town. then they got down tied the beasts legs to a pole and carried him thus till they came to a bridge. as they went the children shouted so loudly that the ass took fright kicked his legs free and jumped over the bridge into the river. said the camel. said the pig. the camel stood on this side the wall and reaching the plants within by means of his long neck made a breakfast on them. his only clothing was a piece of cloth which he wore round his waist. the cat required milk to keep it so a cow had to be kept. the boy required a house to live in so a house was built for him. to look after the house a maid had to be engaged. to provide company for the maid a few more houses had to be built and people invited to live in them. asked the wolf. said the wolf. the wolf believed the fox and followed the waves rather far from the shore. said the birds. the birds left the place at once. asked the farmer. said the farmer. an ass who observed this thought that the dog amused himself by barking. therefore he sent for the village doctor and laid the case before him. bright. said the king. each soldier was exactly like the rest but one of them had been cast last of all and there had not been enough tin to finish him but he stood as firmly upon his one leg as the others on their two and it was just this soldier who became remarkable. through the little windows one could see straight into the hall. it is no place for her. when the evening came all the other tin soldiers were put into their box and the people in the house went to bed. the tin soldiers rattled in their box for they wanted to join but could not lift the lid. but the tin soldier pretended not to hear him. that was a terrible passage when the rain was past two street boys came by. goodness preserve us but then it had been a heavy rain. he thought. ah said the rat. the boat went on but the rat came after it. hold him but the stream became stronger and stronger. now he was already so near it that he could not stop. and now the paper parted and the tin soldier fell out but at that moment he was snapped up by a great fish. oh how dark it was in that fishs body at last something flashed through him like lightning. the fish had been caught carried to market bought and taken into the kitchen where the cook cut him open with a large knife. she seized the soldier round the body with both her hands and carried him into the room where all were anxious to see the remarkable man who had traveled about in the inside of a fish but the tin soldier was not at all proud. they placed him on the table and there no what curious things may happen in the world. the tin soldier was in the very room in which he had been before that moved the tin soldier he was very nearly weeping tin tears but that would not have been proper. he looked at her but they said nothing to each other. then one of the little boys took the tin soldier and flung him into the stove. he gave no reason for doing this. the colors had quite gone off from him but whether that had happened on the journey or had been caused by grief no one could say. and the fir tree did not like to hear that at all. it took no pleasure in the sunshine in the birds and in the red clouds that went sailing over him morning and evening. when it was winter and the snow lay all around white and sparkling a hare would often come jumping along and spring right over the little fir tree. oh this made him so angry. where were they going they smelt like fir. asked the fir tree. why do they keep all their branches we know where they go. oh asked the fir tree and trembled through all its branches. if it were only christmas now now i am great and grown up like the rest who were led away last year. oh if i were only on the carriage and then oh im suffering im longing but the fir tree did not rejoice at all but it grew and grew winter and summer it stood there green dark green. the parting was not at all agreeable. oh how the tree trembled what was to happen now it was splendid particularly splendid. oh that the lights may be soon lit up when may that be done i wonder if trees will come out of the forest to look at me yes he did not guess badly. at last the candles were lighted. cried the young ladies and they hastily put the fire out. now the tree might not even tremble. oh that was terrible thought the tree. oh they rushed in upon it so that every branch cracked again if it had not been fastened by the top and by the golden star to the ceiling it would have fallen down. the children danced about with their pretty toys. but i can only tell one. cried others and there was a great crying and shouting. but he had been in the evenings amusement and had done what was required of him. the fir tree stood quite silent and thoughtful never had the birds in the wood told such a story as that. thought the fir tree and believed it must be true because that was such a nice man who told it. and it looked forward with pleasure to being adorned again the next evening with candles and toys gold and fruit. and the tree stood all night quiet and thoughtful. but they dragged him out of the room and upstairs to the garret and here they put him in a dark corner where no daylight shone. thought the tree. and he leaned against the wall and thought and thought. and he had time enough for days and nights went by and nobody came up and when at length some one came it was only to put some great boxes in a corner. how good people are if it were only not so dark here and so terribly solitary not even a little hare that was pretty out there in the wood when the snow lay thick and the hare sprang past yes even when he jumped over me but then i did not like it. said a little mouse and crept forward and then came another little one. they smelt at the fir tree and then slipped among the branches. asked the mice. have you been there and then it told all about its youth. replied the fir tree and it thought about what it had told. but then he told of the christmas eve when he had been hung with sweetmeats and candles. said the little mice. but they may come again. asked the little mice. and then the fir tree told the whole story. it could remember every single word and the little mice were ready to leap to the very top of the tree with pleasure. next night a great many more mice came and on sunday two rats even appeared but these thought the story was not pretty and the little mice were sorry for that for now they also did not like it so much as before. asked the rats. and they went back to their own people. now thats past too. but when did that happen thought the tree. everything passed so quickly that the tree quite forgot to look at itself there was so much to look at all round. but it was not the fir tree that they meant. in the courtyard a couple of the merry children were playing who had danced round the tree at christmas time and had rejoiced over it. one of the youngest ran up and tore off the golden star. said the child and he trod upon the branches till they cracked again under his boots. said the old tree. past the boys played in the garden and the youngest had on his breast a golden star which the tree had worn on its happiest evening. now that was past and the trees life was past and the story is past too
past past and thats the way with all stories. she said to the fingers that took her out. im breaking and she really broke. there she sat as proud as if she were in a state coach and looked all about her. she inquired of the pin her neighbor. but she really was lost. im here i remain firmly here. theres a straw going by now. how he turns dont think only of yourself you might easily run up against a stone. i sit quietly and patiently here. she observed. asked the bit of bottle. there were five brothers all of the finger family. said the bit of bottle. i am too fine. and proudly she sat there and had many great thoughts. ah im so fine that my mother cannot find me. it was dirty work but they took great delight in it. but nobody listened to her. but she was not really sick though the wagon went over her she lay there at full length and there she may lie. and what do you think happened almost before the corn was planted up shot a large and beautiful flower. the woman loved flowers. wonder of wonders there in the very middle of the flower there sat a little child. such a tiny pretty little maiden she was. they called her thumbelina. that was because she was no bigger than the womans thumb. and where do you think she slept and where do you think she played on the table the woman placed a plate of water. little thumbelina called that her lake. this was thumbelinas little boat. the woman listening heard and thought she had never known so sweet a song. and now such a sad thing happened. such an ugly big toad. she hopped right on to the table where thumbelina lay dreaming in her tiny cradle under the pale pink rose leaf. she peeped at her this ugly old toad. at the foot of the garden was a broad stream. how handsome she thought him but he was really very ugly. indeed he was exactly like his mother. we may lose her if we are not careful. then the old toad carried thumbelina out into the middle of the stream. poor little thumbelina she had not seen the ugly big toad yet nor her ugly son. when she woke up early in the morning how she wept water all around her how could she reach the shore poor little thumbelina then they took away the tiny little bed and thumbelina was left all alone. how the tears stained her pretty little face how fast they fell into the stream but what could the little fish do to help thumbelina oh they were such clever little fish she sang merrily as she floated down the stream away far away out of reach of the ugly old toad and her ugly son. a pretty little white one fluttered on to the leaf on which sat thumbelina. he loved the tiny maiden so well that he settled down beside her. now she was quite happy birds around her flowers near her and the water gleaming like gold in the summer sunshine. what besides could little thumbelina wish the other end she fastened firmly to the leaf. on and on floated the leaf the little maiden and the butterfly. alas he caught sight of little thumbelina. poor little thumbelina how frightened she was how grieved she was too for had she not lost her little friend the butterfly he placed her tenderly on the largest leaf he could find. he looked at her again. only first they carried little thumbelina down from the tree and placed her on a daisy. but all the time you know she was the prettiest little maiden in the world. she was living all alone in the wood now but it was summer and she could not feel sad or lonely while the warm golden sunshine touched her so gently while the birds sang to her and the flowers bowed to her. yes little thumbelina was happy. but summer passed away and autumn came. her little frock was thin and old. she would certainly be frozen to death she thought as she wrapped herself up in a withered leaf. she was so very tiny. she walked through the hard field. she was shaking with cold. all at once she saw a little door just before her. she looked again yes it was a door. she had had nothing to eat for two long days. oh she was very hungry unfortunately he is blind. now the mole was very wise and very clever but how could little thumbelina ever care for him why he did not love the sun nor the flowers and he lived in a house underground. no thumbelina did not wish to marry the mole. then he tried to be very agreeable. mr. mole was very fond of digging underground. a little bird lay in the passage a little bird who had not flown away when the flowers faded and the cold winds blew. it was dead the mole said. when he reached the bird the mole stopped and pushed his nose right up through the ceiling to make a hole through which the daylight might shine. there lay the swallow his wings pressed close to his side his little head and legs drawn in under his feathers. he had died of cold. thought thumbelina. all wild birds were her friends. had they not sung to her and fluttered round her all the long glad summer days but the mole kicked the swallow with his short legs. thumbelina said nothing. that night the little maiden could not sleep. she got up out of her tiny bed. down the long underground passage little thumbelina walked carrying the carpet. she reached the bird at last and spread the carpet gently round him. she fetched warm cotton and laid it over the bird. did you sing to me through the long summer days when the leaves were green and the sky was blue and she stooped to press her tiny cheeks against the soft feathers. as she did so she heard what could it be could the bird be alive little thumbelina listened still. yes it was the beating of the little birds heart that she heard. he had not been dead after all only frozen with cold. the little carpet and the covering the little maid had brought warmed the bird. he would get well now. what a big bird he seemed to thumbelina she was almost afraid now for she was so tiny. she was tiny but she was brave. drawing the covering more closely round the poor swallow she brought her own little pillow that the birds head might rest softly. thumbelina stole out again the next night. but he could not tell her how he had come to the underground passage. at last spring came and the sun sent its warmth down where the swallow lay in the underground passage. farewell thumbelina loved the swallow dearly. and now sad days came to little thumbelina. not go out in the bright sunshine oh poor little thumbelina the mole had said he wished to marry little thumbelina before the cold winter came again. in the evening the mole came to visit her. but oh little thumbelina did not wish the summer to end. live with the dull old mole who hated the sunshine who would not listen to the song of the birds live underground with him little thumbelina wished the summer would never end. all the wedding clothes were ready. autumn was come. and little thumbelina wept. little thumbelina wondered. the mole arrived to fetch his little bride. how could she say goodby for ever to the beautiful sunshine she cried and waved her little hands towards the glorious sun. she cried and threw her tiny arms round a little red flower growing at her feet. what was that thumbelina heard could it be the swallow little thumbelina looked. she told him weeping she must not stay. she must marry the mole and live underground and never see the sun the glorious sun. they had reached the warm countries now. on and on flew the swallow till he came to a white marble palace. and among the broad green leaves many a swallow had built his nest and one of these nests belonged to thumbelinas little swallow. and little thumbelina clapped her hands with joy. but think what was her surprise in the very heart of the flower stood a little prince fair and transparent as crystal. on his head he wore a crown of gold on his shoulders a pair of delicate wings and he was small every bit as small as thumbelina. he was the spirit of the flower. for you know in each flower there is a spirit a tiny little boy or girl but this little prince was king of all the flower spirits. how glad thumbelina was the little king wished to marry her. yes she would be his little queen. then out of each blossom stepped tiny little children. and when they were fastened on the shoulders of the little queen she could fly from flower to flower. yes but then it was such a wonderful one why it must certainly have been a magic box but how could she get it ah here was her chance. she heard the steps come nearer and nearer. she looked she could see him now with a knapsack on his back and his sword at his side. but he did not tell her that she did not look as though she had much money to spare. climb up to the top and you will see a hole. it is large. you must creep through it and let yourself down right down under the tree. asked the soldier. why did i not tell you you should have money. it is there under the tree copper silver gold. cried the witch in a rough and eager voice. more than a hundred lamps are burning. there you will see three doors. in the first room in the middle of the floor is a big box. on the top of it sits a dog. you shall have my blue checked apron. spread it on the floor. go forward quickly seize the dog and place him on it. after that is done you can open the box and take out as much money as you wish. place the dog on my apron then open the box and take as much silver as you wish. but if you would rather have gold why then open the third door. there you will see another dog sitting on another box. this one is tremendous quite gigantic and he has eyes oh such great rolling eyes they are as large as the round tower. he is a dog indeed but do not let that trouble you. place him on my blue checked apron and he will not hurt you. said the soldier. but what am i to give you old witch up the tree climbed the soldier into the tree he crept through the hole at the top and down down the hollow inside he slipped and there he was in a wide passage lighted as the witch had said by a hundred burning lamps. he placed the witchs apron on the floor seized the dog bravely and placed him on the apron. then he opened the box. yes then he seized the dog placed it on the witchs apron and raised the lid of the second box. silver every coin was silver he must have silver. he was rich now. on he went to the third room. there indeed was another box and another dog and oh horrible the soldier almost shut his eyes. the dog had eyes great big rolling eyes eyes as large as the round tower. and they would not keep still. no round and round they rolled. then he walked straight up to the dog. could he lift him yes he took the immense animal in his arms set him on the witchs apron and opened the third box. gold it was full of gold. the soldier was delighted. he threw away his silver money. silver he did not want silver. here was gold gold he filled his pockets and his knapsack but he could not bear to stop there. he was really rich at last. he shut the lid placed the dog again on the box and went out of the room along the passage. said the witch. he had gold in his pockets gold in his knapsack gold in his cap gold in his boots. said the soldier. said the soldier. he had grown rude as well as rich you see. then the soldier cut off her head and the poor witch lay there dead. but the soldier did not stay to look at her. in a great hurry he took all his gold and tied it up in the blue checked apron. how grand he felt what heaps of gold he had in his bundle the servant who cleaned his boots tossed her head. but next day the soldier had bought himself very grand new boots and gay clothing so that no one could possibly call him shabby. shabby but how was he going to find the way into the castle that was the question meanwhile he led a merry life. the soldier was always gaily dressed now. he had a great many friends who said he was a real gentleman and that pleased him very much. leaving the grand hotel he went to live in a small room. he found a tiny attic just under a roof up oh so many stairs. he had no visitors for his grand friends would not take the trouble to walk up so many stairs to his little attic. hungry surely in it there were matches. the soldier opened it eagerly. yes there lay the matches. asked the dog. he was back in a moment and lo and so he had for listen strike it thrice and there appeared the monster dog with eyes that rolled round and round and were as large as the round tower itself. all three dogs did the soldiers bidding. now the soldier could have gold again. gold as much as ever he wished. he moved once more to the grand rooms in the fine hotel. he had gay clothes again and now strangely enough all his friends came to see him and liked him as much as ever. one evening the soldiers thoughts wandered away to the beautiful princess the beautiful princess who was shut up so safely in the great copper palace. yes there she was fast asleep on the dogs back. she was beautiful so beautiful that the soldier was quite sure that she was a real princess. he stooped and kissed her hand. she was so beautiful he could not help it. then off ran the dog back to the copper palace with the princess. and she told an old dame who lived at court to sit in the princesss room at night. but what would the queen have said if she had known that what the princess told them was no dream but something that had really and truly happened well that evening the soldier thought he would like to see the princess again. the old dame sat beside the princesss bed. she had heard all about the princesss dream. she wondered. how she ran the faithful old dame then she walked home and slept. soon afterwards the dog carried the princess back to the copper palace and noticed the great white cross on the door of the hotel where his master lived. and what do you think he did oh he was a wise dog. they had heard the old dames story and were going to see the house with the great white cross. they had scarcely started when the kings eyes fell on a great white cross how could she tell which door she had marked it was quite useless. the dog had perplexed everybody and they went back to the copper palace knowing no more than when they left it. but the queen was a clever woman. she could do more than just sit very properly on a throne. the same evening she took her big gold scissors and cut up a large piece of silk into small pieces. these she sewed together into a pretty little bag. that night the dog came again and carried the princess off to the soldier and the soldier wished he were a prince for then he would marry this beautiful princess. under the window the dog stopped and climbed up the wall with the princess into the soldiers room. then the soldier was seized and put into prison. morning came through the narrow bars of his little window the soldier could see the people all hurrying out of town. they were going to see him hanged. alas alas he was in such a hurry that he lost one of his slippers. nothing will happen till i go. he found it. the rope was being put round the soldiers neck when he turned to the king and queen and earnestly entreated one last favor only to be allowed to smoke one pipe of tobacco. what a harmless request how could the king refuse so harmless a request the king began to speak perhaps he was going to forgive the soldier but no one knows what he was going to say for the biggest dog gave him no time to finish his sentence. he rushed at the king and queen flung them high into the air so that when they fell down they too were broken all to pieces. little boys whistled gaily and the guards presented arms. then the princess was sent for and made queen which she liked much better than living shut up in a copper palace. and the wedding feast lasted for eight whole days and the three monster wizard dogs sat at the table staring around them with all their eyes. john was boots of course because he was the youngest. now near the mans cottage was the kings palace and you must know just against the kings windows a great oak had sprung up which was so stout and big that it took away all the light from the kings palace. so the king said he would give to any one who could dig him such a well as would hold water for a whole year round both money and goods but no one could do it for the kings palace lay high high up on a hill and they had dug only a few inches before they came upon the living rock. so one day those three brothers thought theyd set off and try too and their father hadnt a word against it for even if they didnt get the princess and half the kingdom it might happen they might get a place somewhere with a good master and that was all he wanted. so peter paul and jack went off from their home. but jack didnt care for what they said he climbed the steep hillside towards where the noise came and when he reached the place what do you think he saw said jack. they said. and so off he set to climb the rock while the others laughed and made game of him. but he didnt care a bit for that up he climbed and when he got near the top what do you think he saw said jack. so they went on again a good bit till they came to a brook. they were thirsty all three after their long walk and so they lay down beside the brook to have a drink. where the brook comes from indeed nothing could stop him. on he went. so as he went up and up the brook got smaller and smaller and at last a little way farther on what do you think he saw so now jack was to try. when that was done jack pulled out his spade and fitted it to its handle. yes the husband thought that would do very well. he was quite willing he said. so he got up on the house to tie her up. at last she thought shed waited long enough and went home. so in came the old hag. asked the hag. so the hag put down the sack on the road and went aside by herself into the wood and lay down to sleep. when the hag got home and saw what there was in the sack you may fancy she was in a fine rage. so the old hags husband who was every bit as bad as she took the spoon to have a taste. after that he took all the gold and silver that lay in the house and went home to his mother and became a rich man. the woman handed him jar after jar but he found fault with all. cried the little man taking a loaf from the cupboard as he spoke. so he picked up his work once more and his needle flew in and out like lightning. this was too much for the little fellow. well well very soon see said the little man with great pride. he glanced round the cottage but there was nothing of value to take with him. the only thing he possessed in the world was a small cheese. when he got into the street the neighbors all crowded round him to read the words on his belt. said they to one another. you see they didnt know that the tailor had only killed flies they took it to mean men. soon he reached a lofty mountain and he made up his mind to climb it and see what was going on at the other side. when he reached the top there stood a huge giant gazing down into the valley below. asked the tailor. the giant was too surprised to utter a word for a few minutes then taking up another stone he threw it so high into the air that for a moment they couldnt see where it went then down it fell to the ground again. taking the little bird from his pocket he threw it into the air and the bird glad to get away flew right off and never returned. this sort of thing didnt suit the giant at all for he wasnt used to being beaten by any one. he shouted and the tailor jumped down from the branches and pretended he had been helping all the time. laughed the little tailor. they gave the little man some food and then showed him a bed in which he might pass the night. it was so big that after tossing about for half an hour in it the tailor thought he would be more comfortable if he slept in the corner so he crept out without being noticed. in the middle of the night the giant stole out of bed and went up to the one where he thought the little man was fast asleep. taking a big bar of iron he struck such a heavy blow at it that he woke up all the other giants. the tailor made his escape as soon as possible and he journeyed on for many miles until he began to feel very tired so he lay down under a tree and was soon fast asleep. when he awoke he found a big crowd of people standing round him. he hadnt been in the kings service long before every one grew jealous of him. the soldiers were afraid that if they offended him he would make short work of them all while the members of the kings household didnt fancy the idea of making such a fuss over a stranger. so the soldiers went in a body to the king and asked that another captain should be put over them for they were afraid of this one. the king didnt like to refuse for fear they should all desert and yet he didnt dare get rid of the captain in case such a strong and brave man should try to have his revenge. at last the king hit upon a plan. if you will kill these two giants and bring me back proof that they are dead you shall marry the princess my daughter and have half my kingdom. pray what do i want with a hundred men if i can kill seven at one blow i neednt be afraid of two. he found the pair fast asleep under a tree so he filled his pockets with stones and climbed up into the branches over their heads. then the tailor threw stones at the other man and soon he awoke as the first had done. said he. up they both sprang and seizing each other they began to fight in real earnest. down climbed the little tailor and taking his sword in his hand he plunged it into each giant and then went back to the edge of the forest where the ten men were waiting for him. he made the ten men wait for him at the entrance to the wood as they had done the first time and taking a stout rope and a saw he entered the forest alone. but even then the king was not satisfied and he made the little tailor catch a wild boar that had been seen wandering in the woods. the wild boar made a dash at the little tailor but the man was too quick for it. he slipped into a little building close by with the animal at his heels. then catching sight of a small window he forced his way out into the forest again and while the boar who was too big and clumsy to follow stood gazing at the spot where he had disappeared the tailor ran round and closed the door keeping the animal quite secure inside. then he called the hunters who shot the boar and carried the body back to the palace. this time the king was obliged to keep his promise so the little tailor became a prince and a grand wedding they had too. when they had been married for about a couple of years the princess once overheard her husband talking in his sleep. so she told her father the story and the king said she need not worry for he would find a way out of the difficulty. she was to leave the door open that night and while the tailor was sleeping the kings servants should steal into the room bind the tailor and take him away to be killed. she little knew that one of the tailors servants had overheard their cruel plot and carried the news straight to his master. that night when the princess thought her husband was sleeping fast she crept to the door and opened it. to her great terror the tailor began to speak. havent i killed seven at one blow so the princess had to make the best of a bad job. now because little two eyes looked just like other people her mother and sisters could not endure her. so they pushed her about and threw all their old clothes to her for her to wear and gave her only the pieces that were left to eat and did everything that they could to make her miserable. it so happened that little two eyes was sent into the fields to take care of the goats and she was often very hungry although her sisters had as much as they liked to eat. then the wise woman went away. but oh how she did enjoy her dinner in a moment the table and everything upon it had disappeared. the next morning she went away with the goat leaving them behind where they had been placed for her. so they determined to find out the truth and they arranged that when two eyes took her goat to the field one eye should go with her to take particular notice of what she did and discover if anything was brought for her to eat and drink. but two eyes knew what she had in her mind. one eye seated herself and not being accustomed to walk so far or to be out in the heat of the sun she began to feel tired and as little two eyes kept on singing she closed her one eye and fell fast asleep. she was glad to sit down for the walk and the heat of the sun had really tired her and as her sister continued her song she was obliged to close two of her eyes and they slept but not the third. in fact three eyes was wide awake with one eye and heard and saw all that two eyes did for poor little two eyes thinking she was asleep said her speech to the goat and the table came with all the good things on it and was carried away when two eyes had eaten enough and the cunning three eyes saw it all with her one eye. but she pretended to be asleep when her sister came to wake her and told her she was going home. she took up a butchers knife went out and stuck the good little goat in the heart and it fell dead. on saying this the wise woman vanished. the next morning when they all rose and looked out of the window there stood a most wonderful tree with leaves of silver and apples of gold hanging between them. she supposed it had grown up from the heart of the goat for it stood over where she had buried it in the earth. one eye climbed up but when she tried to catch a branch and pluck one of the apples it escaped from her hand and so it happened every time she made the attempt and do what she would she could not reach one. one eye slid down from the tree and three eyes climbed up. at last the mother was impatient and climbed up herself but with no more success for as she appeared to grasp a branch or fruit her hand closed upon thin air. but two eyes climbed up and the golden apples did not fly back from her when she touched them but almost laid themselves on her hand and she plucked them one after another till she carried down her own little apron full. it happened that while all three sisters were standing under the tree together a young knight rode by. then they pushed the poor girl in great haste under an empty cask which stood near the tree and several of the golden apples that she had plucked along with her. at this moment little two eyes who was angry because her sisters had not told the truth caused two of the golden apples to slip out from under the cask and they rolled on till they reached the feet of the knights horse. when he saw them he asked in astonishment where they came from. the two ugly maidens replied that they had another sister but they dared not let him see her for she had only two eyes like common people and was named little two eyes. then came two eyes quite comforted from the empty cask and the knight was astonished to find her so beautiful. and she climbed up and without any trouble broke off a branch with its silver leaves and golden fruit and gave it to the knight. then the knight lifted the little maiden on his horse and rode home with her to his fathers castle. but when they rose the next morning lo the tree had vanished and with it all their hopes. and on this very morning when little two eyes looked out of her chamber window of the castle she saw to her great joy that the tree had followed her. little two eyes saw them and looking earnestly in their faces she recognized her two sisters who had become so poor that they were obliged to beg their bread from door to door. but the good sister received them most kindly and promised to take care of them and give them all they wanted. asked the ass. the dog was satisfied and off they set. asked the ass. answered the cat. the cat consented and went with them. the cock consented to this plan and so all four traveled on together. the ass and the dog laid themselves down under a large tree the cat and the cock climbed up into the branches but the latter flew right to the top where he was most safe. the ass as the biggest went to the window and peeped in. asked the cock. weary with their long walk they soon went to sleep. and there they are to this day for anything i know. what good will it do you to kill me asked the good wife. he found the sea no longer bright and shining but dull and green. the man went home and found his wife no longer in the old hut but a pretty little cottage stood in its place and his wife was sitting on a bench by the door. outside there was a little yard with chickens and ducks and a little garden full of vegetables and fruit. the flounder might have given us a bigger house. i want to live in a big stone castle. the mans heart was heavy and he was very unwilling to go. but at last he went. he found the sea was no longer green it was still calm but dark violet and gray. said the flounder. then the man went away thinking he would find no house but when he got back he found a great stone palace and his wife standing at the top of the steps waiting to go in. with that they went to bed. see here now could we not be king over all this land go to the flounder. go to the flounder. said the woman. so the man went but he was quite sad because his wife would be king. said the flounder. i cant bear it any longer. go back to the flounder. said the woman. to him thou must go and that right quickly. if he can make a king he can also make an emperor. he had to go but he was quite frightened. it tossed to and fro and a sharp wind blew over it and the man trembled. said the flounder. he went in and saw his wife sitting on a huge throne made of solid gold. it was at least two miles high. she had on her head a great golden crown set with diamonds three yards high. its no good its too monstrous altogether. go immediately. said the flounder. so there he stood gazing at her and it was like looking at a shining sun. at first she sat as stiff as a post without stirring. can i not cause the sun and the moon to rise her husband who was still more than half asleep was so shocked that he fell out of bed. he thought he must have heard wrong. she looked at him so wildly that it caused a shudder to run through him. then she flew into a terrible rage. asked the flounder. and there they are to this very day as she was sewing and looking out of the window at the snow she pricked her finger with the needle and three drops of blood fell upon the snow. and when the child was born the queen died. a year after the king took to himself another wife. she was beautiful but proud and she could not bear to have any one else more beautiful. at last she was well pleased for she knew the lookingglass spoke the truth. now snowwhite grew up and became more and more beautiful and when she was seven years old she was as beautiful as the day and more beautiful than the queen herself. then the queen was angry and turned green with envy. from that hour whenever she looked at snowwhite her breath came and went she hated the girl so much. the cook had to salt this and the wicked queen ate it and thought she had eaten the heart of snowwhite. but now the poor child was all alone in the great wood and so afraid that she started at every bush and did not know what to do. she ran as long as her feet would go until it was almost evening then she saw a little cottage and went into it to rest herself. then as she was so tired she lay down on one of the little beds but none of them suited her one was too long another too short but at last she found the seventh one was just right and so she stayed in it said her prayers and went to sleep. they lit their seven candles and as it was now light within the cottage they could see that some one had been there for everything was not in the same order in which they had left it. but the seventh when he looked at his bed saw little snowwhite who was lying asleep there. and he called the others who came running up and they cried out with wonder and brought their seven little candles and let the light fall on little snowwhite. and they were so glad that they did not wake her but let her sleep on in the bed. and the seventh dwarf slept with the others one hour with each and so got through the night. when it was morning little snowwhite awoke and was afraid when she saw the seven dwarfs. but they were friendly and asked her what her name was. said the dwarfs. then she told them that the queen had wished to have her killed but that the huntsman had spared her life she had run for the whole day until at last she had found their house. not long after in the evening the seven dwarfs came home but how shocked they were when they saw their dear little snowwhite lying on the ground she did not stir or move and seemed to be dead. when she heard that all her blood rushed to her heart with fear for she saw plainly that little snowwhite was again alive. then she took the shape of another old woman. but as good luck would have it it was almost evening and the seven dwarfs soon came home. when they saw snowwhite lying as if dead upon the ground they knew at once the queen had been there and they looked and found the comb. scarcely had they taken it out when snowwhite came to herself and told them what had happened. then they warned her once more to be upon her guard and to open the door to no one. when she heard the glass speak thus she trembled and shook with rage. she went into a quiet secret lonely room where no one ever came and there she made an apple full of poison. it was white with a red cheek so that every one who saw it longed for it but whoever ate a piece of it must surely die. she knocked at the door. said the old woman. snowwhite longed for the fine apple and when she saw that the woman ate part of it she could stand it no longer and stretched out her hand and took the other half. but hardly had she a bit of it in her mouth when she fell down dead. when the dwarfs came home in the evening they found snowwhite lying upon the ground she breathed no longer and was dead. then they were going to bury her but she still looked as if she were living and still had her pretty red cheeks. then they put the coffin out upon the hill and one of them always stayed by it and watched it. and birds came too and wept for snowwhite first an owl then a raven and last a dove. it happened that a kings son came into the wood and went to the dwarfs house to spend the night. he saw the coffin on the hill and the beautiful snowwhite within it and read what was written upon it in golden letters. as he spoke in this way the good dwarfs took pity upon him and gave him the coffin. and now the kings son had it carried away by his servants on their shoulders. and before long she opened her eyes lifted up the lid of the coffin sat up and was once more alive. she cried. snowwhite was willing and went with him and their wedding was held with great show and splendor. then the wicked woman gave a scream and was so wretched so utterly wretched that she knew not what to do. at first she would not go to the wedding at all but she had no peace and must go to see the young queen. and when she went in she knew snowwhite and she stood still with rage and fear and could not stir. then she was forced to put on the red hot shoes and dance until she dropped down dead. just before the princess started on her journey the queen pricked her finger and dropped three drops of blood upon a handkerchief. the princess took the handkerchief and embraced her mother. they shed many tears at parting but at last the princess mounted the wonderful horse and started on the journey. being very thirsty the princess asked the maid to bring her a drink in the golden cup. the sun shone on them fiercely and the road was filled with dust so that they had not gone far before the princess again became thirsty. the maid however had observed the loss with no small satisfaction. this made him very angry all day. when asked how she had offended he told the king that she spoke every morning to the horses head that was over the gate and that the head replied and called her princess. then the king followed on to the field where he hid behind a bush and watched them herd the geese. he told her he had watched her at the gate and in the field and asked her the meaning of her strange actions. she sobbed and wept until the king who had stood outside and heard all came in and bade her dry her eyes. the prince was summoned and the old king told him the story and showed him the true bride. she was so beautiful that the prince knelt at her feet in admiration and knew her to be the real princess. a great banquet was given to which many guests were invited. this was made known to the king who commanded that a watch should be kept every night under the tree. now the king had three sons and he sent the eldest into the garden when night was coming on but at midnight he fell fast asleep and in the morning another apple was missing. the following night the second son had to watch but he did not succeed any better and again another apple was missing in the morning. the youth threw himself on the ground under the tree and watched steadily without letting sleep master him. away flew the bird but the arrow had knocked off one of its feathers which was of the finest gold. the youth picked it up and showed it to the king next morning and told him all he had seen in the night. thereupon the king assembled his council and each one declared that a single feather like this one was of greater value than the whole kingdom. so the eldest son went forth on his travels to look for the wonderful bird and he had no doubt that he would be able to find it. when he had gone a short distance he saw a fox sitting close to the edge of the forest so he drew his bow to shoot. thought the young prince and shot at the fox but missed it so it ran away with its tail in the air. as time passed away and the eldest son did not return home the second son set out on his travels to seek the golden bird. like the eldest brother he met with the fox and did not follow the good advice it gave him. this he could not resist so he went in and began to live a life of pleasure only. again a long time passed by without any news so the youngest prince wished to try his luck but his father would not hear of it. at last for the sake of peace the king was obliged to consent for he had no rest as long as he refused. the fox was again sitting at the edge of the forest and once more it begged for its own life and gave its good advice. go straight on and thou wilt come to a castle before which a whole troop of soldiers will be lying asleep. go right through the midst of them into the castle and thou wilt come to a chamber where is hanging a wooden cage containing a golden bird. when they arrived at the castle the prince found everything as the fox had said and he soon discovered the room in which the golden bird was sitting in its wooden cage by it stood a golden one while three golden apples were lying about the room. but the prince thought it would be silly to put such a lovely bird in so ugly and common a cage so opening the door he placed it in the golden cage. the next morning he was brought before a judge who at once condemned him to death. still the king said his life should be spared on one condition and that was that he brought him the golden horse which ran faster than the wind and if he succeeded he should also receive the golden bird as a reward. the young prince set out on his journey but he sighed and felt very sorrowful for where was he to find the golden horse everything happened as the fox had said. the following morning he was brought to trial and condemned to death but the king promised him his life as well as the golden horse if the youth could find the beautiful daughter of the king of the golden castle. once more with a heavy heart the prince set out on his journey and by great good fortune he soon came across the faithful fox. the path to the castle lies straight before thee thou wilt reach it about the evening. on the evening of the seventh day however the fox appeared. and the next morning when he awoke and looked out of the window the mountain had disappeared then these two went away together and it was not long before the faithful fox came to them. mount it instantly and give your hand to everyone at parting and last of all to the princess. this was all happily accomplished and the kings son carried off the beautiful princess on the golden horse. then ride on the golden horse to the courtyard of the palace where thy coming will cause great joy and they will fetch the golden bird for thee. with this the fox ran off into the forest so he rode on with the beautiful maiden and his path led him once more through the village in which his two brothers had stopped. then the young prince asked if they could not be freed. the young prince consented and while they were all talking together he quite forgot the foxs warning and suspected no evil. but suddenly the two brothers threw him backwards into the well and seizing the maiden the horse and the golden bird they went home to their father. there was great rejoicing but the horse would not eat neither would the bird sing and the maiden only sat and wept. but the youngest brother had not perished. then he told him to seize hold of his tail and hold on tightly and so saying he lifted him up in the air. no one recognized him but the golden bird began to sing and the golden horse commenced to eat and the lovely maiden ceased to weep. then she told him all that had happened although the other brothers had threatened to kill her if she betrayed them. the king then summoned all the people in the castle before him and there came with them the young prince dressed as a beggar in his rags but the maiden recognized him instantly and fell upon his neck. but what became of the poor fox so he entreated the prince to shoot him dead and cut off his head and feet. at last the prince consented to do so and scarcely was the deed done than the fox was changed into a man who was no other than the brother of the beautiful princess at last released from the spell that had bound him. so now nothing was wanting to the happiness of the prince and his bride as long as they lived. now it happened that misfortune came upon the merchant. there was still left to him a little house in the country and to this when everything else had been sold he retired. his three daughters of course went with him. and so it went on. in this way a whole year went by and then one day a letter came for the merchant. he hastened to find his daughters for he was anxious to tell them the good news contained in the letter. this letter says that one of the ships supposed to have been lost has come safely home to port and if that be so we need no longer live in poverty. we shall not be so rich as before but we shall have enough to keep us in comfort. i will set out at once to claim my ship. but the sisters were very much offended and went off to sit in their own room to talk of the fine things they would have when their father came back. in the meantime the merchant went his way to the city full of hope and great plans as to what he would do with his money. he spent the whole day looking about to make sure there was no truth in the letter he had received and it was beginning to get dusk when he started out with a sad heart to make the journey home again. he was tired and miserable and he had tasted no food since he left home in the morning. it was quite dark by the time he came to the great wood through which he had to pass to get to his cottage and when he saw a light shining through the trees he decided not to go to his home that night but to make his way towards the light in the wood and ask for food and shelter. he expected to find a woodcutters cottage but what was his surprise as he drew near to the light to find that it came from the windows of a large and beautiful palace he knocked at the gates but no one answered and presently driven by hunger and cold he made bold to enter and mounted the marble steps into the great hall. all the way he never saw a soul. there was a big fire in the hall and when he had warmed himself he set out to look for the master of the house. so the merchant sat down as bold as you please and made a very hearty supper after which he again thought he would look for the master of the house. and with that he tumbled into bed and being very tired he went to sleep at once and slept like a top till it was time to get up in the morning. when he awoke he was quite surprised to find himself in such a soft and comfortable bed but presently he remembered all that had happened to him. down the marble steps he went and when he came to the garden he saw that it was full of roses red and white and pink and yellow and the merchant looked at them and remembered beautys wish. so he stretched out his hand and plucked the biggest red rose within his reach. said the beast. cried the merchant. and then he began to weep to think that he must die and leave his beauty alone in the world with no one to be kind to her. the wretched man promised. so the merchant followed him back into the palace. there on the floor of the hall lay a great and beautiful chest of wrought silver. and so with a heavy heart the merchant went away but as he went through the palace gate the beast called to him that he had forgotten beautys rose and at the same time held out to him a large bunch of the very best. the merchant put these into beautys hand when she ran to meet him at the door of their cottage. and with that he sat down and told them the whole story. the father tried hard to persuade her not to go but she had made up her mind and at the end of the three months she set out for the beasts palace. her father went with her to show her the way. as before he saw the lights shining through the wood knocked and rang in vain at the great gate warmed himself at the fire in the big hall and then found the little room with the supper on the table that made you hungry to look at. only this time the table was laid for two. but the next moment the beast came into the room. beauty screamed and clung to her father. beauty left alone tried not to feel frightened. she ran here and there through the palace and found it more beautiful than anything she had ever imagined. as she spoke she happened to look at a big mirror and in it she saw the form of her father reflected just riding up to the door of his cottage. that night when beauty sat down to supper the beast came in. said he. the poor beast sighed and went away. and every night the same thing happened. he ate his supper with her and then asked her if she would marry him. all this time she was waited on by invisible hands as though she had been a queen. he is ill and he thinks that i am dead. when she wanted to come back she was to do the same thing. so in the morning when she awoke she found herself at her fathers house and the old man was beside himself with joy to see her safe and sound. so beauty thinking it would amuse them to hear told them and their envy increased day by day. at the end of that time her sleep grew troubled and she dreamed that she saw the beast lying dead among the roses in the beautiful gardens of his palace and from this dream she awoke crying bitterly. but the palace was empty and no one answered her when she called. then she ran through the gardens calling his name again and again but still there was silence. she said. then she remembered her dream and ran to the rose garden and there sure enough beside the basin of the big fountain lay the poor beast without any sign of life in him. beauty flung herself on her knees beside him. alas alas he knelt at beautys feet and clasped her hands. now dear one the enchantment is broken let us go back to my palace. so they returned to the palace which by this time was crowded with courtiers eager to kiss the hands of the prince and his bride. and the prince whispered to one of his attendants who went out and in a very little time came back with beautys father and sisters. and beauty and the beast who was a beast no more but a handsome prince lived happily ever after. and indeed i believe they are living happily still in the beautiful land where dreams come true. it was some time before he could decide what the task should be. but at last he told them that he had a fancy for a very beautiful little dog and that they were all to set out to find one for him. they were to have a whole year in which to search and were all to return to the castle on the same day and present the various dogs they had chosen at the same hour. he was young and handsome and as clever as a prince should be besides being brave. so he journeyed on from day to day not knowing where he was going until one night he lost his way in a thick dark forest and after wandering many weary miles in the wind and rain he was glad to see at last a bright light shining through the trees. however something seemed to bid him enter the castle so he pulled the bell. the prince began to think he must be dreaming when the door opened and a lovely little white cat came in. she wore a long black veil and was accompanied by a number of cats dressed in black and carrying swords. she came straight up to the prince and in a sweet sad little voice bade him welcome. then she ordered supper to be served and the whole company sat down together. on looking out of his window he saw that the white cat and her attendants were about to start out on a hunting expedition. the hands led him up to a wooden horse and seemed to expect him to mount. they had an excellent days sport. before he reached the castle he met his two brothers who made fine fun of the wooden horse and also of the big ugly dog which trotted by his side. they imagined this to be the one their brother had brought back from his travels hoping that it would gain the prize. so once more the brothers set out upon their travels. as for the youngest he mounted his wooden horse and rode straight back to his dear white cat. then she bade him goodby and he mounted the wooden horse and rode away. it passed with the greatest ease through the eye of the smallest needle in the kingdom and the prince felt that now the prize must be his. the appointed time passed happily away and one evening the white cat reminded the prince that on the next day he must return home. then the white cat told him that if only he would do as she bade him all would be well. no sooner had he cast the head and the tail into the fire than a beautiful princess appeared where the body of the cat had been. the spell that had been cast upon her was broken and at the same time her courtiers and attendants who had also been changed into cats hastened in in their proper forms again to pay their respects to their mistress. the prince at once fell deeply in love with the charming princess and begged her to accompany him to his fathers court as his bride. she consented and together they rode away. during the journey the princess told her husband the story of her enchantment. she had been brought up by the fairies who treated her with great kindness until she offended them by falling in love with the young man whose portrait the prince had seen upon her paw and who exactly resembled him. now the fairies wished her to marry the king of the dwarfs and were so angry when she declared she would marry no one but her own true love that they changed her into a white cat as a punishment. so the poor old king felt that now he would be obliged to give up his kingdom. the story of pretty goldilocks 
there was once a princess so lovely that no one could see her without loving her. she always wore a crown of flowers and her dresses were embroidered with pearls and diamonds. the fame of her beauty reached a young king who determined to marry her although he had never seen her. with great ceremony he presented the kings gifts of pearls and diamonds together with his message. now at the kings court was a young man so handsome and clever that he was called charming. his enemies at once went to the king and used the remark to influence him against charming. the king told him of the boast his enemies had repeated. the king at once saw that he had been deceived and restored charming to favor. the king was delighted and offered him a splendid escort but he asked only for a good horse. a few days later while riding along his way he saw a raven pursued by an eagle. exclaimed charming as he set the bird free. after that it flew swiftly away. charming at last reached the palace of the princess and asked an audience. his name so pleased her that she at once received him. he believed that she had but used this means to put him off and his disappointment was so great that he could not sleep. in its mouth was a beautiful ring which it laid in charmings hand. asked the princess. he traveled straight to the giants castle. the giant appeared at the door club in hand. charming cut off the head of the giant and carried it back with him to the princess. just then he heard his name called twice and looking back he saw an owl flying toward him. the princess this time consented to marry the king and after many preparations she and charming started for his kingdom. charming replied that he must have considered his duty to his king even before a happiness so great. the king with presents of rich jewels and a splendid escort met them on the way to the palace. the princesss grief only made the king more jealous but he determined to make use of this wonderful water of which she had told. not daring to confess she put another in its place that exactly resembled it in appearance. this however contained a deadly poison. there was great confusion in the palace when the king was found dead. charming fell at her feet and expressed his gratitude and joy. they were married soon afterward and they reigned together for many happy years. one day when she had just filled her pitcher at the fountain an old woman asked to drink from it. now this was not a trembling old peasant as she appeared but a fairy who rewarded good deeds. when the girl reached home her mother scolded her for her long absence. as she spoke some pearls and diamonds issued from her lips. asked the astonished widow. the widow immediately called her favorite daughter to her. asked she. the girl ran home to her mother who met her at the door. she ran to beat the poor younger sister who fled to the forest to escape the cruel blows. when she was past pursuit she threw herself upon the green grass and wept bitterly. the kings son returning from the hunt found her thus and asked the cause of her tears. she was so pretty that he fell in love with her at once and pressed her to tell him more. she then related to him the whole story while pearls and diamonds kept falling from her lips. meanwhile the ugly and selfish sister had made herself so disagreeable that even her own mother turned against her. she too was driven forth into the forest where she died miserable and alone. the poor woman declared with tears in her eyes that she should be the happiest creature in the world if she had a son and although he was no bigger than her husbands thumb she would be satisfied. the fairy queen wishing to see the little fellow thus born into the world came in at the window while the mother was sitting up in bed admiring him. the queen kissed the child and giving it the name of tom thumb sent for some of the fairies who dressed her little favorite as she bade them. it is remarkable that tom never grew any larger than his fathers thumb which was only of an ordinary size but as he got older he became very cunning and full of tricks. soon after the adventure of the pudding toms mother went to milk her cow in the meadow and she took him along with her. said his mother. fortunately his mother caught him in her apron as he was falling to the ground or he would have been dreadfully hurt. she then put tom in her bosom and ran home with him. a large fish swallowed tom the moment he fell into the sea which was soon after caught and bought for the table of king arthur. when they opened the fish in order to cook it everyone was astonished at finding such a little boy and tom was quite delighted to be out again. it is said that when the king rode out on horseback he often took tom along with him and if a shower came on he used to creep into his majestys waistcoat pocket where he slept till the rain was over. king arthur one day asked tom about his parents wishing to know if they were as small as he was and whether rich or poor. tom told the king that his father and mother were as tall as any of the sons about court but rather poor. our little hero had some trouble in lifting the burden upon his back but he at last succeeded in getting it placed to his mind and set forward on his journey. however without meeting with any accident and after resting himself more than a hundred times by the way in two days and two nights he reached his fathers house in safety. now as tom had disappeared the court broke up and the miller went home to his mill. when the doctor came tom began to dance and sing and the doctor being as much frightened as the miller sent in haste for five other doctors and twenty learned men. when king arthur shone         his court was my home. he also gave him a coach drawn by six small mice. alive he filled the court with mirth   his death to sorrow soon gave birth. he was eighteen feet in height and about three yards round the waist of a fierce and grim countenance the terror of all the neighboring towns and villages. you shall pay dearly for this. jack then filled up the pit with earth and went to search the cave which he found contained much treasure. after this the giant locked poor jack in an immense chamber leaving him there while he went to fetch another giant his brother living in the same wood who might share in the meal on jack. the next morning jack laughing in his sleeve gave him hearty thanks for his nights lodging. the king did his best to persuade his son from it but in vain so at last gave way and the prince set out with two horses one loaded with money the other for himself to ride upon. putting his hand into his pocket the prince gave the woman all he had left so that after their days food which cost what small store jack had by him they were without a penny between them. early in the morning jack furnished his master with a fresh supply of gold and silver and then sent him three miles forward on his journey at which time the prince was pretty well out of the smell of the giant. jack thanked his uncle and then went off with them. with that she put it in her bosom. the prince went to bed in great sorrow but jacks cap of knowledge informed him how it was to be obtained. when she entered the place of the demon she gave the handkerchief to him and he laid it upon a shelf whence jack took it and brought it to his master who showed it to the lady next day and so saved his life. on that day she gave the prince a kiss and told him he must show her the lips tomorrow morning that she kissed last night or lose his head. at midnight she went as before and was angry with the demon for letting the handkerchief go. this broke the enchantment and the evil spirit left her and she appeared in all her beauty. are you there the giant all this while could not see him on account of his invisible coat so that jack coming up close to the monster struck a blow with his sword at his head but missing his aim he cut off the nose instead. through many woods he passed and came at length to the foot of a high mountain. when they secured her within the castle they transformed her into a white hind. jack gave the old man his hand and promised that in the morning he would venture his life to free the lady. then the enchantment was broken and all the lords and ladies who had so long been transformed into birds and beasts returned to their proper shapes and the castle vanished away in a cloud of smoke. so married they were and the whole kingdom was filled with joy at the wedding. well they began to wonder upstairs how it was that she was so long drawing the beer and her mother went down to see after her and she found her sitting on the settle crying and the beer running over the floor. said her mother. said the mother and she sat her down beside the daughter and started crying too. then after a bit the father began to wonder that they didnt come back and he went down into the cellar to look after them himself and there they two sat crying and the beer running all over the floor. says he. now the gentleman got tired of stopping up in the kitchen by himself and at last he went down into the cellar too to see what they were after and there they three sat crying side by side and the beer running all over the floor. and he ran straight and turned the tap. and then they all started crying worse than before. well he set out and he traveled a long way and at last he came to a womans cottage that had some grass growing on the roof. so the gentleman asked the woman what she was doing. im going to get the cow on to the roof to eat it. well that was one big silly. at last he stopped and wiped his face with his handkerchief. i cant think who could have invented such things. it takes me the best part of an hour to get into mine every morning and i get so hot so the gentleman burst out laughing and showed him how to put them on and he was very much obliged to him and said he never should have thought of doing it that way. so that was another big silly. then the gentleman went on his travels again and he came to a village and outside the village there was a pond and round the pond was a crowd of people. so the gentleman burst out laughing and told them to look up into the sky and that it was only the shadow in the water. so the gentleman turned back home again and married the farmers daughter and if they didnt live happy for ever after thats nothing to do with you or me. the king you see was the right sort he was the real boy and loved sport as he loved his life and hunting in particular and from the rising o the sun up he got and away he went over the mountains after the deer and fine times they were. says he. says he. says the king. says the king. my dear at the word of making his goose as good as new youd think the poor old kings eyes were ready to jump out of his head. says the king. they all came and next day after breakfast they stood in a row in the lawn and the princess walked along in the front of them to make her choice. she stopped a little before the last of all for he was a fine man in face and form. off he led her and dismal enough she was. said she as they were going through one. said she to herself. at last they were coming up to a poor cabin. says the poor lady. she began to cry but she was tired and hungry and she went in with him. there was neither a table laid out nor a fire burning and she was obliged to help her husband to light it and boil their dinner and clean up the place after and next day he made her put on a stuff gown and a cotton handkerchief. well then he asked her to mend their clothes but the needle drew blood from her fingers and she cried again. the king was going to be married but no one knew who the bride was to be. so they came near the door to get a peep and who should come out but the king himself as handsome as you please and no other but king whiskers himself. whether she would or no he held her hand and brought her into the parlor. but she was soon caught by the king and taken into the back parlor. said he. well she didnt know how she was with fright and shame and joy. the eldest and second eldest were cunning clever fellows but they called the youngest jack the fool because they thought he was no better than a simpleton. the eldest got tired of staying at home and said hed go look for service. if it was the master he should also pay double wages if it was the servant he should get no wages at all. said he. he agreed with him for a year for twenty pounds and the terms were the same. next day he came into the parlor just before the dinner was served up. they werent sorry to have him away from the kitchen at dinner time. he came up. the mistress god bless her is after giving me my breakfast dinner and supper and yourself told me that bed was the next thing. next morning early jack asked how hed be employed that day. said the master. in a day or two the master bade him go and mind the cows in a field that had half of it under young corn. there she is as harmless as a lamb. ill give you your money when you go to dinner. and neither did he. said jack. said he. well he couldnt imagine who threw it at him or why it was thrown at him. after a little he got a blow on the other cheek and still it was by another sheeps eye. well he was much vexed but he thought better to say nothing. my time is up. when the company heard the rights of the business they were only too eager to see the job done. so all came again into the other room and jack was made to sit down and everybody drank his health and he drank everybodys health at one offer. but the landlord didnt like his looks. the landlord opened his eyes as you may fancy. off they went together and they came to donalds door. donald had finished making the last pile of ten gold pieces. that was all they could say. ah you thought you had played me a fine trick but you never did me a better turn in all your lives. up the people came running from one end of the fair to the other. cried they. well as you may fancy if they loved donald little before they loved him less now. but it was no use talking. pay for it he must and should. said donald. said donald and this time he said it as loud as he could. said a farmer who had just come up with a drove of cattle and was turning in for a glass. out crawled donald in crept the farmer. i always put it down as lies but it is just as true as my word. but ill not be thinking of old times. when they came to the brown lake the sky was full of little white clouds and if the sky was full the lake was as full. cried donald as he pointed to the clouds in the lake. they never came back. maybe they got too fat like the cattle. she approached the spot where he stood and when she was near he spoke to her and asked who she was and from what place she had come. said the king. no children you are wrong. there was once upon a time a piece of wood. having said this he immediately took a sharp axe with which to remove the bark and the rough surface. he turned his terrified eyes all around the room to try and discover where the little voice could possibly have come from but he saw nobody who then could it be and taking up the axe he struck a tremendous blow on the piece of wood. oh oh... here there is certainly not a living soul. i cannot believe it. can anyone be hidden inside it if anyone is hidden inside so much the worse for him. so saying he seized the poor piece of wood and commenced beating it without mercy against the walls of the room. oh was all my imagination but all the same he was in a great fright he tried to sing to give himself a little courage. when he at last opened his eyes he found himself seated on the floor. his face was quite changed even the end of his nose instead of being crimson as it was nearly always had become blue from fright. a lively little old man immediately walked into the shop. geppetto was very fiery. he became furious and there was no holding him. exclaimed the same little voice and it was impossible to say where it came from. the two old men having each recovered his own wig shook hands and swore that they would remain friends to the end of their lives. it is a name that will bring him luck. i once knew a whole family so called. no one answered. and it grew and grew and grew until in a few minutes it had become an immense nose that seemed as if it would never end. poor geppetto tired himself out with cutting it off. he roared in a threatening tone. the mouth then ceased laughing but put out its tongue as far as it would go. the hands were scarcely finished when geppetto felt his wig snatched from his head. he turned round and what did he see you are not yet completed and you are already beginning to show want of respect to your father and he dried a tear. the legs and feet remained to be done. when geppetto had finished the feet he received a kick on the point of the nose. pinocchios legs were stiff and he could not move but geppetto led him by the hand and showed him how to put one foot before the other. i must tell you that the curtain was drawn up and the play had already begun. do i dream or am i awake it is our brother pinocchio it was all breath thrown away. he was very big and so ugly that the sight of him was enough to frighten anyone. his beard was as black as ink and so long that it reached from his chin to the ground. i need only say that he trod upon it when he walked. at his unexpected appearance there was a profound silence no one dared to breathe. a fly might have been heard in the stillness. papa save me on the whole however he had not a bad heart. he was quite moved and felt sorry for him. said pinocchio. poor old man said pinocchio. however i have had pity on you so i must have patience. his terror was so great that his legs bent under him and he fell with his face on the ground. bind me and throw me amongst the flames. at dawn they were still dancing. why he has never a penny in his pocket. i feel almost sorry for him here are five gold pieces. but he had not gone far when he met on the road a fox lame in one foot and a cat blind in both eyes who were going along helping each other like good companions in misfortune. it is true that she shut them again and so quickly that pinocchio observed nothing. said the fox. said the cat. if only he had not spoken said pinocchio to the cat. i am already close to the house and i will return home to my papa who is waiting for me. who can tell how often the poor old man must have sighed yesterday when i did not come back i have found it to my cost for many misfortunes have happened to me. repeated the cat. repeated the cat. repeated the cat. asked pinocchio remaining with his mouth open from astonishment. in this field you must dig a little hole and you put into it we will say one gold piece. in the meanwhile during the night the gold piece will grow and flower and in the morning when you return to the field what do you find repeated the cat. repeated the cat. having gone into the inn they all three sat down to table but none of them had any appetite. he had such a disgust for food he said that he could put nothing to his lips. the one who ate the least was pinocchio. no sooner had pinocchio got into bed than he fell asleep at once and began to dream. it was the host who had come to tell him that midnight had struck. pinocchio paid a gold piece for his supper and that of his companions and then he left. who goes there he said to himself and not knowing where to hide his gold pieces he put them in his mouth precisely under his tongue. then he tried to escape. repeated the other. you rascal then you have hidden your money under your tongue after a race of some miles pinocchio could do no more. in less time than it takes to tell the pine began to burn and flame like a candle blown by the wind. what was he to do two they fell into the very middle of the ditch. but when he had reached a certain spot almost in front of the big oak he stopped because he thought that he heard people amongst the bushes. in fact two persons came out on the road. can you guess who they were... repeated the cat. oh poor pinocchio said the fox. repeated the cat. and pinocchio pointed to the big oak which was two steps from them. said the fox. whilst they were thus talking pinocchio observed that the cat was lame of her front right leg for in fact she had lost her paw with all its claws. the cat tried to answer but became confused. i will answer for her. why do you not listen to my advice said the fox. will you come with us in half an hour you will be there. you can bury your money at once and in a few minutes you will collect two thousand and this evening you will return with your pockets full. and they went. asked pinocchio. they crossed the town and having gone beyond the walls they came to a solitary field which to look at resembled all other fields. pinocchio obeyed. he dug a hole put into it the four gold pieces that he had left and then filled up the hole with a little earth. thus saying they took leave of pinocchio and wishing him a good harvest went about their business. and instead of two thousand supposing i found five thousand and instead of five thousand that i found a hundred thousand oh what a fine gentleman i should then become... he advanced another hundred steps nothing he entered the field ... he went right up to the little hole where he had buried his gold pieces and nothing. he then became very thoughtful and forgetting the rules of society and good manners he took his hands out of his pockets and gave his head a long scratch. asked pinocchio in an angry voice. i also believed it once and today i am suffering for it. and there he remained for four months four long months and he would have remained longer still if a fortunate chance had not released him. one day without any reason whatsoever the thought of death and sickness came to him. the idea of falling ill or dying made him very wretched. he could not get away from it. whoever drank of this wonderful draught lived forever. the crane grew large enough for him to ride on it with comfort. it then spread its wings rose high in the air and flew away over the mountains right out to sea. sentaro was at first quite frightened but by degrees he grew accustomed to the swift flight through the air. on and on they went for thousands of miles. after several days they reached an island. as soon as sentaro got down from the birds back the crane folded up of its own accord and flew into his pocket. he walked first round about the country and then through the town. everything was of course quite strange and different from his own land. he had wished to escape from dying. these they swallowed eagerly hoping for death to come so that they might go to paradise. he never saw anyone ill after eating these horrible things nor did he ever see anyone with as much as a cold. sentaro was delighted. he was the only happy man on the island. for his part he wished to live thousands of years and to enjoy life. he set himself up in business and for the present never even dreamed of going back to his native land. this caused him great annoyance. time passed like the flight of an arrow for him for he was busy from morning till night. no sooner did he pray than the paper crane popped out of his pocket. once more the bird grew and grew till it was large enough for him to mount it. as he did so the bird spread its wings and flew swiftly out across the sea in the direction of japan. he tried to stop the bird in vain. the crane held on its way for thousands of miles across the ocean. sentaro fell with it. he looked round but there was no ship in sight. suddenly a bright light came towards him and in the light stood a messenger. but you grew weary of living there and begged to be allowed to return to your native land so that you might die. your desire for death was not real for even at that moment you cried out loudly and shouted for help. thus will you live to a good old age and be happy but give up the vain desire to escape death for no man can do that and by this time you have surely found out that even when selfish desires are granted they do not bring happiness. the angel disappeared as soon as he had finished speaking and sentaro took the lesson to heart. one day when the priest of the temple was about to hang it over the hearth to boil the water for his tea to his amazement the kettle all of a sudden put forth the head and tail of a badger. what a wonderful kettle to come out all over fur so he brought out the kettle which had resumed its former shape and had got rid of its head and tail and showed it to the tinker. the tinker started up in a fright to see what it could all mean when all of a sudden the kettle resumed its former shape. even the princesses too and the great ladies of the court took great delight in the dancing kettle so that no sooner had it shown its tricks in one place than it was time for them to keep some other engagement. cut its tongue and let it go. at last they found its home. when the sparrow saw that its old master and mistress had come to see it it rejoiced and brought them into its house and thanked them for their kindness in old times. the sparrow then gave them the light basket and they returned with it to their home. they never expected anything like this. the more they took out the more they found inside. when the cross old woman who had cut the sparrows tongue saw this she was filled with envy and went and asked her neighbor where the sparrow lived and all about the way. it was as heavy as a stone and hard to carry but at last she got back with it to her house. battle of the monkey and the crab 
a monkey and a crab once met when going round a mountain. at once it sprung up and soon became a tree so high one had to look far up to see it. went the egg which was lying hidden in the ashes and burned the monkeys arm. one day the old man went to the mountains to cut grass and the old woman went to the river to wash clothes. then a monkey came and got one the same way. so all three went along with him. in no time they arrived at the island of the devils and at once broke through the front gate momotaro first then his three followers. all this was done in a fair fight. great was the joy of the old man and the old woman when momotaro came back. his parents knew however that he understood his boat and the sea very well and they were never much concerned about him. even when he failed to come back as soon as he was expected they awaited his return without anxiety. this he placed in the boat by itself where it would safely keep until he could take it home. it asked. the young fisherman replied that the experience would please him. in a moment they were shooting down through the green water. after three nights they reached the bottom of the sea and came to a wonderful palace of gold and crystal. she was so beautiful that when she asked him to remain in the palace he gladly consented. how long he dwelt there he could not have told. but one day he thought of his parents then he remembered that they must be troubled by his absence. the thought of them kept coming to him continually and the longing to see them grew so strong that at last he told the princess he must go to visit them. she begged him not to leave her and wept bitterly. but he told her that he must see his father and mother once again then he would return to the palace in the sea to be with her always. when she found that she could not persuade him to remain she gave him a small gold box which she told him he must on no account open. he eagerly ran to the village and looked about for some of his comrades. all of the faces were strange and even the houses seemed different. the children playing in the street where he had lived he had never seen before. stopping in front of his own house he regarded it with a sinking heart. there was the sound of music from a window above and a strange woman opened the door to him. she could tell him nothing of his parents and had never heard their names. the date showed him that his father and mother had died soon after he left them and then he discovered that he had been away from his home three hundred years. bowed with sorrow he went back to the city. at each step he hoped to wake and find it all a dream but the people and streets were real. he thought of the princess and remembered the gold box she had given to him. it might be that he was under some cruel enchantment and that this box contained the charm to break the spell. before he died the people of the village gathered about him and listened to his strange story. long afterward they told their children of the young man who for the love of his parents left a marvelous palace in the sea and a princess more beautiful than the day. so quickly did it pass that he scarcely saw it nevertheless a burning desire to capture and possess the beautiful strange creature filled his breast. nearer and nearer he advanced till just as he thought to lay hold of the beautiful strange creature it gave one mighty bound leaped clean over the kings head and fled toward the mountains. she held the vessel of water to the kings lips and as he drank he looked into her eyes and then it became clear to him that the girl was no other than the white hind with the golden horns and silver feet he had chased so far. her beauty bewitched him so he fell on his knees begging her to return with him as his bride but she only laughed saying seven queens were quite enough even for a king to manage. it was a handsome boy but the other queens were very jealous that the youngest among them should be so fortunate. through this he disappeared returning in an hour or so laden with sweetmeats which he divided equally among the seven blind queens. at last when he was quite a big lad he one day took his bow and arrow and went out to seek for game. it came tumbling past the very window where the white queen was sitting she rose to see what was the matter and looked out. cried the cunning white witch. hearing this the lad was delighted beyond measure and gave up the pigeon at once. whereupon the white queen told him to seek her mother without delay and ask for the eyes which she wore as a necklace. now as the son of seven queens could not read he took the fatal message cheerfully and set off to find the white queens mother. they told him it was because the kings only daughter refused to marry therefore when her father died there would be no heir to the throne. the inhabitants nearly went wild with joy but the son of seven queens said he would not marry the princess unless they first let him recover his mothers eyes. drawing his bow he shot one and it came fluttering past the window. the white hind looked out and lo there was the kings son alive and well. then the lad bravely did as he had been told. one fell dead just beneath the window where the white queen was sitting. she sent for him to ask how he had returned so soon and when she heard how kindly her mother had received him she very nearly had a fit. he looked back and lo there was nothing left of him but a little heap of ashes so she made her husband build a palace exactly like the one in which the seven queens had lived and in which the white witch now dwelt in splendor. then when all was prepared she bade her husband give a grand feast to the king. so the otter went down to the river to catch fish. presently the otter returned home bringing a string of fish with him. so the tortoise was summoned likewise. the jackal ran up and down here and there but for a long time could find nothing to eat. i fancied i had caught hold of the jackals paw but there he is calling out in a cheerful voice. there you are. how suspicious this jackal is and early the next morning he crawled as fast as he could to the jackals den which was a hole in the side of a hill and crept into it and hid himself waiting for the jackal who was out to return home. if i come and all is safe and right you always call out to me. i like to hear your pretty voice. and he ran as fast as he could and dragged all the dry branches and bits of stick he could find close up to the mouth of the den. when the jackal had gathered together all the sticks he could find and put them round the mouth of his den he set them on fire and pushed them as far into it as possible. is it nice and warm he will trouble me no more. first he met a brahman and to him he gave a cake asking him to point out the road to ram but the brahman only took the cake and went on his way without a word. at last he came upon a poor man sitting under a tree and finding out he was hungry the kindly farmer gave him his last cake and sitting down to rest beside him entered into conversation. asked the poor man at length. replied the farmer. the farmer went back to his village rejoicing. if you will take me across ill show you the place. this plan will suit me as well as you. the camel consented and swam across the river taking the jackal who could not swim on his back. and they all went down to the place to drive him away. this made them very angry and they caught the poor camel and drove him from the field and beat him and beat him until he was nearly dead. the water reached up to his knees then above them up up up higher and higher until he was obliged to swim. asked the jackal. so saying he rolled over in the water shaking the jackal off as he did so. and the jackal was drowned but the camel swam safely ashore. oh dear let us run on a mile or two. and they would both run away as fast as they could. after some time spent in this way they found however one fine day that the lion was so close upon them that they could not escape. your very voice is death. after struggling for some time in the deep water he sank to rise no more. the king of the forest is dead is dead we have killed the great lion who would have killed us he was also brave but his heart was not proof against this loss. from the hour she was buried there was no more joy or peace for him. his heart was already dead within him. he had heard the old people say that there was a path that led to the land of souls and he determined to follow it. he accordingly set out one morning after having completed his preparations for the journey. at first he hardly knew which way to go. for a while he could see no change in the face of the country. he had left behind him the land of snow and ice. the air became mild the dark clouds of winter had rolled away from the sky a pure field of blue was above him and as he went he saw flowers beside his path and heard the songs of birds. having done this they both issued forth to the lodge door. it is the land of souls. but you can not take your body along. leave it here with your bow and arrows your bundle and your dog. but all things retained their natural colors and shapes. there was but one thing in which he saw a very unusual effect. he noticed that his passage was not stopped by trees or other objects. he appeared to walk directly through them. they were in fact but the souls or shadows of material trees. he became sensible that he was in a land of shadows. he found a canoe of shining white stone tied to the shore. he was now sure that he had taken the right path for the aged man had told him this. they at once pushed out from shore and began to cross the lake. but no sooner was one wreath of foam passed than another more threatening still arose. but they saw many others struggling and sinking in the waves. at length every difficulty was gone as in a moment and they both leaped out on the happy island. they felt that the very air was food. there was no hunting of animals for the air itself was their food. gladly would the young warrior have remained there forever but he was obliged to go back for his body. he did not see the master of life but he heard his voice in a soft breeze. your time has not yet come. the duties for which i made you and which you are to perform are not yet finished. you will be the ruler of your tribe for many days. the rules you must observe will be told you by my messenger who keeps the gate. she was rather silly and very idle. for days together she would sit doing nothing. it was that of singing. the chief was of a far greater size than the people of his nation usually are being as long as a man and quite as broad. instead of singing to him she now began to listen to his voice. this state of things gave them much sorrow. he asked the lovers why they seemed to be so sad. with that he bade the girl follow him into the river. immediately a change took place in her. she did not however forget the land of her birth. it came from nowhere and it went to nowhere. he said. and he lay down in the middle of the ring to think looking up into the blue sky. then he peeped out and saw the basket come down to the earth and rest on the grass in the middle of the ring. twelve beautiful maidens were leaning over the edge of the basket. the maidens were frightened and ran to the basket and jumped in and the basket flew up into the sky and grew smaller till at last he could not see it at all. his mother begged him to tell her what the matter was and at last he told her and said he would never be happy till he brought one of the maidens home to be his wife. the eldest maiden put her head over the edge and looked all around north and east and south and west. so they all jumped out to have their dance. cried the eldest maiden. as soon as he was inside the ring he turned into a little mouse and made friends with the family of mice that lived in a hole under the grass and the mother mouse promised to help him all she could. they had not waited long when the basket came dropping down out of the sky. the eldest sister put her head over the edge and looked all around north and west and south and east and down on the ground. but when they came near the mouses nest the eldest sister held up her hand and they stopped dancing and held their breath. her sisters came rushing round her and begged her to go back home to the sky with them but she looked into the young mans eyes and said she would go with him wherever he went. and he did so. she only ate berries and crushed corn. but as soon as he was out of sight the little yellow bird flew in and perched on her shoulder and sang her such a beautiful song about her sisters in the sky that she forgot everything else and slipped out and ran like the wind and got to the dancing ring just as her sisters came down in their basket. then they all gathered round her and begged her to go home with them. her father was very glad to see her and she was very glad to see him and they talked and they talked till the blue sky was getting gray. then she remembered that she ought to have gone home long before. said her father. she begged to be let out but it was no use. then she began to weep and she wept so much that the cloud began to weep too and it was weeping itself quite away. so her father saw she would go down to the earth in rain if he kept her in the cloud any longer and he let her out. so he sent the basket down empty and it rested in the middle of the dancing ring. he shot two with one arrow and then all the rest flew away. he called her but she did not answer. so he threw himself down on the grass and lay looking up at the stars till he went to sleep. early in the morning he heard a rustling on the grass and when he opened his eyes he saw the great basket close beside him. there was nobody there and when he began to climb out again he found that the basket was half way up to the sky. he made him a splendid present and told him to keep the secret. the vizier came as he was ordered and they left the palace without attendants. a grave and stately stork was hunting for frogs while another flew about and kept him company. suddenly however the vizier ceased his mirth and commenced bowing to the east. so at last in despair the two unhappy birds wandered through the meadows. they shouted. the procession came nearer. he at once recognized the new ruler as the son of his worst enemy. suddenly the vizier stopped and remarked that if it were not ridiculous for a stork to be afraid of ghosts he would feel decidedly nervous. he started to rush toward it but the vizier held him fast by a wing. my father ordered him thrown down stairs and in revenge he managed to have me given a powder which changed me into this hideous shape. we will listen outside the door and perhaps you may hear the forgotten word. about the table sat eight men among whom was their enemy the magician. the magician was taken to the ruined castle and hanged and his son was given the choice of the black powder or death. i have never permitted myself earnestly to will any thing. the vizier thought the poor man was mad and told him to call again some other time. this he put into a large covered basket as if it were the thing which it represented the usual gift sent in token of great respect. the master of the house was absent but his son received the traveler learned his errand and accepted the offering. the father looked at it and then asked his son what he had sent as a return present. then he swallowed the rest of the cake and ran off leaving the little boy waiting for the new moon. her husbands brother lived alone with his only son in a house near hers and when the son brought home a wife the old woman went to call on the bride. the bride said she had not. after a few hours the cat disappeared and the bride supposing it to have gone home made no search for it. the young woman told her that the cat went away the same day that it came and she had supposed it had gone home. i and my family also want money. now you may go but only upon condition that when you come back you will each bring me something i want. the one shall bring me some fire wrapped in paper and the other some wind in a paper. she stopped and asked them what was the matter and whether she could help them. for the first a paper lantern only would be needed. the two young women thanked the wise child and went on their way rejoicing. the head of the family listening behind a curtain heard how the valuable stone in her heap could be discovered. i have never before seen one without sorrow nor one with so young a head. if you can i will fine you no more. now i stand with one foot on one side my threshold and the other foot on the other side tell me whether i mean to go in or come out. she told him and he said that all he could do for her was to give her a box of needles. this he did and went on his way. a farmer soon came along from the fields leading his ox and he also asked the cause of her distress and heard her sad story. having heard her tale he said he would leave his horse to stay with her and make the ox more contented. she pointed out a place in the middle of her back yard and he went to work and quickly dug a well. at midnight the boar came and threw himself against the door to break it in. seeing a clean paper spread on the ground he went to lie upon it and fell into the well. on the top of the water floated a golden vessel which the king attempted to seize but just as his hand touched it away it floated to the other side of the well. he went around to where the vessel rested and tried again with the same result. every time the king touched the basin it glided from his grasp. at last losing patience he gave up trying to seize the vessel and bending over the well he began to drink. the people along the way hailed him with delight and when he reached the palace the queen led him to the royal chamber and showed him a beautiful son that had been born during his absence. but as days and months passed and the little prince grew more beautiful all the time the king at last forgot his fears and became happy once more. years went by without anything happening to disturb his peace of mind and the prince grew to be a beautiful youth who was the joy and pride of the king and queen. he got farther and farther away from his companions and at last found himself alone in a dark part of the wood where he never before had been. not knowing in which direction his path lay he called again and again to the hunters. asked the prince. the prince told the king not to despair for though he might go away he was certain to return to him. when he had said farewell to his unhappy parents he mounted his horse and rode for two days without stopping. on the third day he came to a lake on whose smooth surface thirty ducks were swimming while spread about upon the grass were thirty white garments. his green eyes looked out from under a golden crown and his hideous claws clutched the air with rage when he saw the prince. the prince went back to his chamber and sadly awaited his doom. she asked. in the morning he looked out of the window and saw a wonderful marble palace with a roof of gold. that evening the little bee entered the room and told him that this task was quite as difficult as the first because the sisters were all exactly alike. the next day the magician summoned him to his presence and showed him the thirty daughters standing in a row. the prince passed before them twice without daring to choose but he saw the little fly on the pink cheek of one of the maidens. exclaimed he. the magician was greatly astonished but not yet satisfied he required of the prince still another task. at last the magician lost patience and ordered the door burst open. but the prince would not take her advice and insisted upon passing through the gates. an old man came along and digging up the flower carried it home with him and planted it in his garden. she asked and told the old man her story. she went to the cook and asked to be allowed to make the wedding cake. the cook was so struck with her beauty that he could not refuse the request. so unhappy was she made that her eyes were often red from weeping. my eyes are tired of the sight of her and my ears of the sound of her voice. here he left her with nothing to shield her from the bitter cold. i will tell you. smiled the maiden. he asked in answer. king frost bent over her and snapped his fingers about her until the air seemed full of needles. it barked always the same. she was not long alone when king frost came by. he asked. the king danced in front of her and cracked his fingers. he asked her over and over. rushing out to welcome her daughter and her treasures she clasped the frozen body in her arms and the chill of it killed her. aladdin and his lamp or would you like to hear the tale     of blue beard fierce and grim i think youre fond of him. little red hen 
little red hen found a grain of wheat. she asked. so she buried the wheat in the ground. after a while it grew up yellow and ripe. so she took the wheat to the mill where it was ground. then she carried the flour home. she asked. there was none left at all for the cat or the goose or the rat. on the door were what mrs. stone heard as she sat at supper in her tiny house in the wood. she went to open the door and there she saw a dear little girl about three years old. she said. asked mrs. stone when supper was over and the little girl had begun to think once more about how she was to find her way home. she was so sure that it did not seem any good to say any more about it. but why do you want a baby i want a real baby to play with. said a voice and a man came in with a bag of tools. at last i came to the wood and saw this house. we only have that on sunday at home. but just then steps were heard on the path and there was a sharp knock at the door. cried the little girl. you have a new baby brother. so now i have got two new friends and a baby too. and meg trotted off as happy as a little queen. father is a very big man. he always has lots of money in his pocket. he goes to business in a train every day. we have a real farm quite near to our house where they keep cows chickens pigs horses and geese. one day in summer we went to see the farmer. i had my blue dress on so that the cows would not be angry when they saw me. we met the farmer near the stable. we said both at the same time. he said. mother was at the garden gate. we ran up to her. by this time we both had our arms round mothers waist and she was laughing. so we went to the station to meet him. asked father and his eyes were laughing you could not see his mouth for his beard. but he soon grew to be a big dog. the door was just a wee crack open. the dolls from the dolls house were going for a ride in the big horse and cart. if you like i will come and stay with you till you go to sleep. then old mrs. rabbit took a basket and her umbrella and went through the wood to the bakers. peter was most dreadfully frightened he rushed all over the garden for he had forgotten the way back to the gate. it was a blue jacket with brass buttons quite new. it would have been a beautiful thing to hide in if it had not had so much water in it. he began to turn them over carefully looking under each. he went back to his work. peter sat down to rest he was out of breath and trembling with fright and he had not the least idea which way to go. also he was very damp with sitting in that can. he found a door in a wall but it was locked and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath. she only shook her head at him. peter began to cry. then he tried to find his way straight across the garden but he became more and more puzzled. his back was turned toward peter and beyond him was the gate he slipped underneath the gate and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden. his mother was busy cooking she wondered what he had done with his clothes. it was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that peter had lost in a fortnight i am sorry to say that peter was not very well during the evening. the miller his son and their ass 
once upon a time there was a miller who lived in a little house beside his mill. all day long he worked hard but at night he went home to his wife and his little boy. one day this miller made up his mind that he would take his ass to the fair and sell it. so he and his boy said farewell to the dame and started off. they had not gone far when they met a number of girls coming from the town. said one of them. soon they came to a number of old men standing by the side of the road talking together. upon this the son got down from the ass and the miller took his place. they had not gone very far when they met two women coming home from market. they cried at once. then the miller who was a goodnatured man took his son up behind him and in this way they went to the town. so he and his son got down and tied the legs of the ass together. the poor ass was very uncomfortable and tried hard to get off the pole. at last as they were passing over a bridge he pulled his legs out of the rope and tumbled to the ground. he was so frightened that he jumped off the bridge into the river and was drowned. if you try to please everybody you will please nobody. they said over and over. one night just before christmas mother tucked them in bed and left them to go to sleep. at last they both sat up in bed. they both listened and they heard a little tap tap on the window. they looked and there right in the window they saw a funny little brownie. jack and margaret scrambled from their beds. they cried in great excitement. then the brownie took something soft and thick and dark and tied it around jacks eyes. next he took something soft and thick and dark and tied it around margarets eyes. he asked. both of them shook their heads. he took jacks hand on one side and margarets on the other. it seemed as if they flew through the window. the children could not tell whether they were going north south east or west. after a time they stopped. the brownie knocked and the gate was swung open. it was a very queer garden. margaret at once ran over to a bed of dolls. said margaret in great surprise. the brownie picked a little doll from the bed and laid it in margarets arms. its eyes went half shut and then stuck. he picked another one and this one shut its eyes just as if it had gone to sleep. he tried several others and he picked a good many. jack called. said jack to the brownie. but it made such a queer sound that jack and margaret both laughed out loud. the little red drum was put back into the bed and the brownie tried another big one. and jack and margaret marched all along the bed keeping step to it. that was the most fun of all. the next bed they came to was filled with toys which could be wound up. the children stayed at this bed for a long time. then he pointed to a hill in the distance. the children stared at it. it was so white that it seemed to shine in the distance. said margaret. they had almost reached the middle of it when jack looked down. he said and gave margaret a pull. and down down down they went. they sat up and rubbed their eyes. there they were right in their own beds at home. mother opened the door. she said. then they told her all about it and mother just smiled. the greedy brownie 
there was once a little brownie who lived in a hollow tree stump. the brownie had been away all the day so that when at last he turned to go back to his home he felt really very tired. the brownie thought this would be a very nice cool place in which to rest for a few moments. the naughty girls thought that they would drink it for supper. no sooner had the two girls settled themselves than the brownie who was now wide awake and who was himself feeling that some supper might not be out of place crept up behind them and blew out the candle. the farmers wife caught sight of the empty basin. she was very angry with them indeed. when the little fellow curled himself up some time later in the tree trunk he was still laughing. here we are waiting all of us here. whence came you nothing at all but they now understand. crash eh what is this . . . where are they at all . . the good man cries. from london punch. it was the tailors mother who spoke. she was a very old woman and nearly helpless. continued the tailor sadly. at this moment the two boys came in their arms full of moss which they dropped on the floor. asked tommy. and the boys eyes filled with tears. said the good woman. tell us about the brownie that used to live in your grandfathers house. he never would be seen and was off before they could catch him. cried tommy. asked tommy. the boys brought out a pan of water. johnny was soon in the land of dreams but tommy lay awake thinking how he could find a brownie and get him to live in the house. ii 
the moon rose like gold and went up in the heavens like silver. tommy opened his eyes and ran to the window. downstairs he crept softly and out into the still night. cried a voice from the grove near the house. he ran to a big tree and looked up. there he saw the old owl sitting on a branch and staring at him with yellow eyes. said tommy for he did not like the owl very well. she cried. tommy climbed the tree and sat face to face with her on the big branch. said the owl. said the owl. said tommy. cried tommy. said tommy. said the owl. tommy knew the place very well. he ran to the north side of the pond and turning himself around three times he repeated the charm. then he looked in and saw himself. i cant think of the right word. what can it be and back he went. there sat the owl as before. inquired tommy in a dismal tone. now listen to me tommy. little people can do only little things. that is very strange i thought the moon was shining. iii 
while his brother was rubbing his eyes tommy told him of his visit to the old owl in the grove. asked johnny. they swept the room and laid the table. just as they were putting the potatoes in a dish they heard footsteps. but now when he entered the kitchen he looked around in great surprise. he put his hand out to the fire to see if it was really warm. he touched the potatoes and looked at the neat room. there was great excitement in the small house but the boys said nothing. all day the tailor talked about the brownie. to come and do the work for a pan of cold water the boys said nothing until they were both in bed. but i dont like to have father thinking that we are still idle. day after day went by and still the boys rose early and each day they found more and more to do. the farmer gave him an order for a suit of clothes and paid him at once. full of joy at his good fortune he hurried home. at last a fine new suit with brass buttons was finished and laid out for the brownie. he went softly downstairs. there was johnny sweeping the floor and tommy trying on the new suit. shouted the father. they shouted. the grandmother however could hardly believe that a real brownie had not been in the house. the story of peter pan 
once upon a time there were three children named wendy john and michael who lived with their father and mother in london. that evening a little boy climbed in through the window whose name was peter pan. the most remarkable thing about him was that he never grew up. tinker bell was jealous of the little girl wendy and she hurried ahead of peter pan and persuaded the boys that wendy was a bird who might do them harm and so one of the boys shot her with his bow and arrow. so he told the boys that if they would build a house around wendy he was sure that she would be better. so they hurried to collect everything they had out of which they could make a house. when the house was done peter pan took johns hat for the chimney and the little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that smoke at once began to come out through the hat. all that night peter pan walked up and down in front of wendys house to watch over her and keep her from danger while she slept. all these children lived in an underground cave and the next day when wendy got well they all went down into the cave and wendy agreed to be their mother and peter their father. they had many good times together. one day wendy and her brothers realized that they had been away so long that perhaps their mother had forgotten them and shut the window of the nursery so that they could not get back. they decided to hurry home. when they reached home peter pan was before them and he closed the window so that they could not get back. but when he heard the childrens mother singing such a sad song inside his heart was made tender and he opened the window and the children crept back safely into their mothers arms. wendy promised to go once a year and stay a few days with peter pan and clean house and mend his clothes. the birds are singing in their nests and in the branches and far below the clouds you can see the land and the sea. wendy is sewing for peter and peter pan is playing his pipes while she works. in a few days wendy will go back to john and michael to tell them what a good time she had on her visit in the little house in the woods. in the sky alone   sang the lark as the sun ascended his throne. you ask a full cup for half a thirst
  half was love of me and half love to be first. and there on his nest where he left her alone   sat his little wife on her little eggs   keeping them warm with wings and legs. did i say alone ah no such thing full in her face was shining the king. he popped his head under her wing and lay   as still as a stone till king sun was away. but as they had not time to learn their lessons     before they went away   there is a school where all the angel children     must work four hours a day. they must not fly about or run too quickly     nor go too far away   and when upon his golden key he calls them     then they must all obey. one day it was so very hot in heaven     that good st. peter slept   and when the little angel children saw it     away they quickly crept. ah then they ran and flew about with laughter     and fluttered far and wide   so far they wandered that of heavens meadow     they reached the other side. angel children     you look so good and fair   we pray you let us come up into heaven     and play a little there. alas then to the good st. peter cried the angels     to help them in their pain   and if he would but this one time forgive them     they would be good again. then blew a mighty blast in wrath upon it     back all the angels flew   and wide he threw the door of heaven open     and thrust the children through. and then he called two great and powerful angels     the strongest of the race   to chase the little demons out of heaven     and clear the holy place. for the fairies mind you come only to two kinds of folk to those who believe in them and to those who need them. so it was plain enough to the fairies that she was in some need of them. you are asking me how tiny was the voice let me see if i can tell you. oh you think it was smaller than that no then i will tell you the truth. after they had reached the foot of the stairs they walked for a long way through a cool corridor. and what do you think they are doing and it was pleasant to see them work for they were all singing. now you will know of course that they were on their way to the home of the fairy queen. and it was but a short while before they were there. nor need i say how beautiful is her majesty herself with wings like the most splendid butterfly and a gown like the morning and a face like the sunshine. uncle henry and aunt em had a big bed in one corner and dorothy a little bed in another corner. it was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor from which a ladder led down into the small dark hole. not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions. when aunt em came there to live she was a young pretty wife. the sun and wind had changed her too. uncle henry never laughed. he worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was. toto played all day long and dorothy played with him and loved him dearly. today however they were not playing. dorothy stood in the door with toto in her arms and looked at the sky too. aunt em was washing the dishes. suddenly uncle henry stood up. aunt em dropped her work and came to the door. one glance told her of the danger close at hand. she screamed. toto jumped out of dorothys arms and hid under the bed and the girl started to get him. aunt em badly frightened threw open the trap door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small dark hole. dorothy caught toto at last and started to follow her aunt. then a strange thing happened. toto did not like it. he ran about the room now here now there barking loudly but dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen. once toto got too near the open trap door and fell in and at first the little girl thought she had lost him. she sprang from her bed and with toto at her heels ran and opened the door. they were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to but neither were they very small. but the little woman was doubtless much older. when these people drew near the house where dorothy was standing in the doorway they paused and whispered among themselves as if afraid to come farther. dorothy listened to this speech with wonder. she continued pointing to the corner of the house. dorothy looked and gave a little cry of fright. asked dorothy. inquired dorothy. asked dorothy. cried dorothy. i know this is true for i am one of them myself and cannot be mistaken. inquired the little old woman. the witch of the north seemed to think for a time with her head bowed and her eyes upon the ground. asked dorothy. asked the little old woman and looked and began to laugh. the feet of the dead witch had disappeared entirely and nothing was left but the silver shoes. that is the end of her. she reached down and picked up the shoes and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to dorothy. dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table. asked dorothy. inquired the girl anxiously. asked dorothy. it is a long journey through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. pleaded the girl who had begun to look upon the little old woman as her only friend. she came close to dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead. where her lips touched the girl they left a round shining mark as dorothy found out soon after. when you get to oz do not be afraid of him but tell your story and ask him to help you. so she went to the cupboard and cut herself some bread which she spread with butter. toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting there. dorothy went to get him and saw such delicious fruit hanging from the branches that she gathered some of it finding it just what she wanted to help out her breakfast. she took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard laying a white cloth over the top. then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were. at that moment dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the witch of the east. she took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her. finally she picked up her basket. she closed the door locked it and put the key carefully in the pocket of her dress. she was surprised as she walked along to see how pretty the country was about her. all were painted blue for in this country of the east blue was the favorite color. toward evening when dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the night she came to a house rather larger than the rest. on the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing. asked the girl. toto was a fine curiosity to all the people for they had never seen a dog before. the girl asked. it is better for people to keep away from oz unless they have business with him. but it is a long way to the emerald city and it will take you many days. this worried dorothy a little but she knew that only the great oz could help her get to kansas again so she bravely resolved not to turn back. she bade her friends goodbye and again started along the road of yellow brick. when she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down. dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the scarecrow. then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it while toto ran around the pole and barked. asked the girl in wonder. asked dorothy. dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole for being stuffed with straw it was quite light. dorothy was puzzled at this for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man speak and to see him bow and walk along beside her. he inquired. she returned in surprise. i dont know anything. they walked back to the road. dorothy helped him over the fence and they started along the path of yellow brick for the emerald city. do let me carry that basket for you. i shall not mind it for i cant get tired. sometimes indeed they were broken or missing altogether leaving holes that toto jumped across and dorothy walked around. she offered a piece to the scarecrow but he refused. dorothy saw at once that this was true so she only nodded and went on eating her bread. the scarecrow sighed. asked the child. i was only made day before yesterday. what happened in the world before that time is all unknown to me. so he painted my right eye and as soon as it was finished i found myself looking at him and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity for this was my first glimpse of the world. and when the second eye was done i could see much better than before. then he made my nose and my mouth. but i did not speak because at that time i didnt know what a mouth was for. i had the fun of watching them make my body and my arms and legs and when they fastened on my head at last i felt very proud for i thought i was just as good a man as anyone. he and his friend soon after walked away and left me alone. so i tried to walk after them. but my feet would not touch the ground and i was forced to stay on that pole. it was a lonely life to lead for i had nothing to think of having been made such a little while before. any crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw. then he hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted. brains are the only things worth having in this world no matter whether one is a crow or a man. and she handed the basket to the scarecrow. toward evening they came to a great forest where the trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick. it was almost dark under the trees for the branches shut out the daylight but the travelers did not stop and went on into the forest. dorothy could not see at all but toto could for some dogs see very well in the dark and the scarecrow declared he could see as well as by day. so she took hold of his arm and managed to get along fairly well. soon after the scarecrow stopped. so the scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage and dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner. she lay down at once and with toto beside her soon fell into a sound sleep. the scarecrow who was never tired stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morning came. she sat up and looked around her. there was the scarecrow still standing patiently in his corner waiting for her. he asked. she saw there was not much bread left in the basket and the girl was thankful the scarecrow did not have to eat anything for there was scarcely enough for herself and toto for the day. she ran to the place and then stopped short with a little cry of surprise. dorothy looked at him in amazement and so did the scarecrow while toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs which hurt his teeth. asked dorothy. she inquired softly for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke. the tin woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe which he leaned against the tree. he asked. the tin woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment. it was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party for soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the travelers could not pass. indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up again. asked the tin woodman. inquired the scarecrow. asked the scarecrow. then i made up my mind that instead of living alone i would marry so that i might not become lonely. she on her part promised to marry me as soon as i could earn enough money to build a better house for her so i set to work harder than ever. so the old woman went to the wicked witch of the east and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage. the leg worked very well once i was used to it. the wicked witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head and at first i thought that was the end of me. but alas i suppose she is still living with the old woman waiting for me to come after her. while i was in love i was the happiest man on earth but no one can love who has not a heart and so i am resolved to ask oz to give me one. both dorothy and the scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story of the tin woodman and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart. dorothy did not say anything for she was puzzled to know which of her two friends was right and she decided if she could only get back to kansas and aunt em it did not matter so much whether the woodman had no brains and the scarecrow no heart or each got what he wanted. what worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone and another meal for herself and toto would empty the basket. to be sure neither the woodman nor the scarecrow ever ate anything but she was not made of tin nor straw and could not live unless she was fed. there were few birds in this part of the forest for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine. these sounds made the little girls heart beat fast for she did not know what made them but toto knew and he walked close to dorothys side and did not even bark in return. said the girl anxiously. with one blow of his paw he sent the scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road and then he struck at the tin woodman with his sharp claws. but to the lions surprise he could make no impression on the tin although the woodman fell over in the road and lay still. asked the lion in surprise as he watched her pick up the scarecrow and set him upon his feet while she patted him into shape again. and she helped the woodman up again. asked the lion. asked dorothy looking at the great beast in wonder for he was as big as a small horse. all the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave for the lion is everywhere thought to be the king of beasts. i learned that if i roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way. whenever ive met a man ive been awfully scared but i just roared at him and he has always run away as fast as he could go. asked the scarecrow. this made the tin woodman very unhappy for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret. the lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong. the tin woodman knew very well he had no heart and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything. she and toto ate the last of their bread and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast. but the lion went away into the forest and found his own supper and no one ever knew what it was for he didnt mention it. and the scarecrow found a tree full of nuts and filled dorothys basket with them so that she would not be hungry for a long time. she thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the scarecrow but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. so he kept a good distance away from the flames and only came near to cover dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. they had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side. the sides were so steep that none of them could climb down and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end. neither can we climb down into this great ditch. asked the scarecrow. then giving a great spring he shot through the air and landed safely on the other side. they were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it and after the scarecrow had got down from his back the lion sprang across the ditch again. the next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air and then before she had time to think about it she was safe on the other side. they found the forest very thick on this side and it looked dark and gloomy. after the lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick silently wondering each in his own mind if ever they would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again. asked the girl. but this one was so broad and deep that the lion knew at once he could not leap across it. cried the scarecrow. so dorothy went first holding toto in her arms the tin woodman followed and the scarecrow came next. without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree. called the scarecrow. this adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of the forest and they walked so fast that dorothy became tired and had to ride on the lions back. they were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them. asked dorothy. this pleased dorothy who had eaten nothing but nuts all day and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit. to be sure the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land. dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held toto in her arms. then before he could pull it out again or let go the raft was swept away and the poor scarecrow was left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river. he called after them and they were very sorry to leave him. of course this was a bad thing for the scarecrow. but surely there is no use for a scarecrow stuck on a pole in the middle of a river. down the stream the raft floated and the poor scarecrow was left far behind. so he sprang into the water and the tin woodman caught fast hold of his tail. then the lion began to swim with all his might toward the shore. it was hard work although he was so big but by and by they were drawn out of the current and then dorothy took the tin woodmans long pole and helped push the raft to the land. they were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the emerald city. asked the tin woodman as the lion lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him. it was a lovely country with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them and had they not felt so sorry for the poor scarecrow they could have been very happy. then they all looked at the river and saw the scarecrow perched upon his pole in the middle of the water looking very lonely and sad. asked dorothy. the lion and the woodman both shook their heads for they did not know. asked the stork. asked the stork. so the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where the scarecrow was perched upon his pole. at every step he felt so gay. but i must go now for my babies are waiting in the nest for me. but dorothy did not know this nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep. but the tin woodman would not let her do this. so they kept walking until dorothy could stand no longer. asked the tin woodman. it was true toto had fallen down beside his little mistress. but the scarecrow and the tin woodman not being made of flesh were not troubled by the scent of the flowers. in a moment he was out of sight. so they picked up toto and put the dog in dorothys lap and then they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers. on and on they walked and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end. they all bowed so low to the little queen that they almost stood upon their heads. cried all the mice in a shrill chorus. toto had always loved to chase mice when he lived in kansas and he saw no harm in it. come back one by one the mice came creeping back and toto did not bark again although he tried to get out of the woodmans arms and would have bitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin. finally one of the biggest mice spoke. cried the little queen. asked the mouse. the queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at once and get all her people. as soon as they heard her orders they ran away in every direction as fast as possible. it was about this time that dorothy woke from her long sleep and opened her eyes. even the scarecrow and the tin woodman could sit on it and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place where the lion lay asleep. dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving her companion from death. the queen of the mice was the last to leave. they all answered and away the queen ran while dorothy held toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her. how strange it all is they passed by several of these houses during the afternoon and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great lion of which they were very much afraid. so they all entered the house where there were besides the woman two children and a man. exclaimed the man. she replied. asked the scarecrow. asked the girl. so that some say he looks like a bird and some say he looks like an elephant and some say he looks like a cat. asked the man. asked the man with surprise. well oz can do anything so i suppose he will find kansas for you. but first you must get to see him and that will be a hard task for the great wizard does not like to see anyone and he usually has his own way. he continued speaking to toto. the woman now called to them that supper was ready so they gathered around the table and dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread and enjoyed her meal. the scarecrow and the tin woodman ate nothing at all. toto ate a little of everything and was glad to get a good supper again. the woman now gave dorothy a bed to sleep in and toto lay down beside her while the lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be disturbed. the scarecrow and the tin woodman stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night although of course they could not sleep. the next morning as soon as the sun was up they started on their way and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them. yet it was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the city. it was high and thick and of a bright green color. at his side was a large green box. the man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it over. but to those who are not honest or who approach him from curiosity he is most terrible and few have ever dared ask to see his face. i am the guardian of the gates and since you demand to see the great oz i must take you to his palace. asked dorothy. even those who live in the city must wear spectacles night and day. he opened the big box and dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and shape. all of them had green glasses in them. the guardian of the gates found a pair that would just fit dorothy and put them over her eyes. then the green man fitted spectacles for the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion and even on little toto and all were locked fast with the key. then the guardian of the gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the palace. everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous. the guardian of the gates led them through the streets until they came to a big building exactly in the middle of the city which was the palace of oz the great wizard. they had to wait a long time before the soldier returned. he said he will grant you an audience if you so desire but each one of you must enter his presence alone and he will admit but one each day. the soldier now blew upon a green whistle and at once a young girl dressed in a pretty green silk gown entered the room. beautiful green flowers stood in the windows and there was a shelf with a row of little green books. when dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her laugh they were so funny. she left dorothy alone and went back to the others. dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around totos neck and they started for the throne room of the great oz. these people had nothing to do but talk to each other but they always came to wait outside the throne room every morning although they were never permitted to see oz. indeed at first he was angry and said i should send you back where you came from. then he asked me what you looked like and when i mentioned your silver shoes he was very much interested. she opened a little door and dorothy walked boldly through and found herself in a wonderful place. but what interested dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room. in the center of the chair was an enormous head without a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever. there was no hair upon this head but it had eyes and a nose and mouth and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant. as dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear the eyes turned slowly and looked at her sharply and steadily. the eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. continued the voice. again the eyes looked at her sharply and they saw she was telling the truth. and at last they looked at dorothy again. asked oz. you have no right to expect me to send you back to kansas unless you do something for me in return. in this country everyone must pay for everything he gets. if you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do something for me first. asked the girl. exclaimed dorothy greatly surprised. sorrowfully dorothy left the throne room and went back where the lion and the scarecrow and the tin woodman were waiting to hear what oz had said to her. her friends were sorry but could do nothing to help her so dorothy went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep. so the scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great throne room where he saw sitting in the emerald throne a most lovely lady. growing from her shoulders were wings gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reached them. now the scarecrow who had expected to see the great head dorothy had told him of was much astonished but he answered her bravely. asked the lady. but until she is dead i will not grant your wish. the scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what oz had said and dorothy was surprised to find that the great wizard was not a head as she had seen him but a lovely lady. so the tin woodman followed him and came to the great throne room. he did not know whether he would find oz a lovely lady or a head but he hoped it would be the lovely lady. but when the woodman entered the great throne room he saw neither the head nor the lady for oz had taken the shape of a most terrible beast. it was nearly as big as an elephant and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold its weight. it was fortunate the tin woodman had no heart at that moment for it would have beat loud and fast from terror. but being only tin the woodman was not at all afraid although he was much disappointed. therefore i have no heart and cannot love. demanded the beast. asked the woodman. so the tin woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and tell them of the terrible beast he had seen. and if he is the great head he will be at my mercy for i will roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us what we desire. the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the lion to the great throne room and bade him enter the presence of oz. the lion at once passed through the door and glancing around saw to his surprise that before the throne was a ball of fire so fierce and glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it. demanded oz. the lion was angry at this speech but could say nothing in reply and while he stood silently gazing at the ball of fire it became so furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room. he was glad to find his friends waiting for him and told them of his terrible interview with the wizard. asked dorothy sadly. said the girl. cried the green girl. the scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw and dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better. the green girl who was very kind to them filled dorothys basket with good things to eat and fastened a little bell around totos neck with a green ribbon. asked dorothy. inquired the girl. but take care for she is wicked and fierce and may not allow you to destroy her. dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on in the palace but now to her surprise she found it was no longer green but pure white. the ribbon around totos neck had also lost its green color and was as white as dorothys dress. the emerald city was soon left far behind. in the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces for there were no trees to offer them shade so that before night dorothy and toto and the lion were tired and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep with the woodman and the scarecrow keeping watch. so as she sat in the door of her castle she happened to look around and saw dorothy lying asleep with her friends all about her. they were a long distance off but the wicked witch was angry to find them in her country so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck. at once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves. they had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth. asked the leader of the wolves. it was lucky the scarecrow and the woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves coming. as soon as he could raise his axe another wolf came up and he also fell under the sharp edge of the tin woodmans weapon. there were forty wolves and forty times a wolf was killed so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the woodman. they waited until dorothy awoke the next morning. she thanked him for saving them and sat down to breakfast after which they started again upon their journey. now this same morning the wicked witch came to the door of her castle and looked out with her one eye that could see far off. she saw all her wolves lying dead and the strangers still traveling through her country. the wild crows flew in one great flock toward dorothy and her companions. when the little girl saw them coming she was afraid. so they all lay upon the ground except the scarecrow and he stood up and stretched out his arms. the king crow flew at the scarecrow who caught it by the head and twisted its neck until it died. and then another crow flew at him and the scarecrow twisted its neck also. there were forty crows and forty times the scarecrow twisted a neck until at last all were lying dead beside him. then he called to his companions to rise and again they went upon their journey. when the wicked witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a heap she got into a terrible rage and blew three times upon her silver whistle. commanded the witch and the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where dorothy and her friends were walking. but the woodman had seen them coming and the scarecrow had decided what to do. this the woodman did and as dorothy lay close beside the lion and held toto in her arms the straw covered them entirely. then dorothy and the lion got up and the girl helped the tin woodman put the straw back into the scarecrow again until he was as good as ever. so they started upon their journey once more. so they marched away until they came near to dorothy. she could not understand how all her plans to destroy these strangers had failed but she was a powerful witch as well as a wicked one and she soon made up her mind how to act. this golden cap had a charm. whoever owned it could call three times upon the winged monkeys who would obey any order they were given. but no person could command these strange creatures more than three times. twice already the wicked witch had used the charm of the cap. the winged monkeys had helped her do this. the second time was when she had fought against the great oz himself and driven him out of the land of the west. the winged monkeys had also helped her in doing this. only once more could she use this golden cap for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other powers were exhausted. so the wicked witch took the golden cap from her cupboard and placed it upon her head. now the charm began to work. one much bigger than the others seemed to be their leader. others of the monkeys caught the scarecrow and with their long fingers pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head. they made his hat and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tree. then they lifted him up and flew away with him to the witchs castle where he was placed in a small yard with a high iron fence around it so that he could not escape. but dorothy they did not harm at all. she stood with toto in her arms watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her turn. the tin woodman and the scarecrow are destroyed and the lion is tied up in your yard. the little girl we dare not harm nor the dog she carries in her arms. the wicked witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark on dorothys forehead for she knew well that neither the winged monkeys nor she herself dare hurt the girl in any way. she looked down at dorothys feet and seeing the silver shoes began to tremble with fear for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them. the reason the lion did not have to do as the witch wished was that every night while the woman was asleep dorothy carried him food from the cupboard. the girl had to work hard during the day and often the witch threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in her hand. but in truth she did not dare to strike dorothy because of the mark upon her forehead. the child did not know this and was full of fear for herself and toto. once the witch struck toto a blow with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in return. dorothys life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to kansas and aunt em again. toto did not really care whether he was in kansas or the land of oz so long as dorothy was with him but he knew the little girl was unhappy and that made him unhappy too. now the wicked witch had a great longing to have for her own the silver shoes which the girl always wore. she watched dorothy carefully to see if she ever took off her shoes thinking she might steal them. but the child was so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took her bath. indeed the old witch never touched water nor ever let water touch her in any way. but the wicked creature was very cunning and she finally thought of a trick that would give her what she wanted. she placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to human eyes. the wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick for as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm and dorothy could not use it against her even had she known how to do so. cried dorothy. she screamed. she then swept it all out the door. after picking out the silver shoe which was all that was left of the old woman she cleaned and dried it with a cloth and put it on her foot again. then being at last free to do as she chose she ran out to the courtyard to tell the lion that the wicked witch of the west had come to an end and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land. asked the girl anxiously. at the same time her own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again and these tears did not need to be wiped away. as for the lion he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet and he was obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it dried. this they decided to do. dorothy went to the witchs cupboard to fill her basket with food for the journey and there she saw the golden cap. she tried it on her own head and found that it fitted her exactly. when the four travelers went in search of the witch she had seen them coming and so sent the winged monkeys to bring them to her. they knew of course they must go straight east toward the rising sun and they started off in the right way. but at noon when the sun was over their heads they did not know which was east and which was west and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields. they kept on walking however and at night the moon came out and shone brightly. the next morning the sun was behind a cloud but they started on as if they were quite sure which way they were going. but day by day passed away and they still saw nothing before them but the scarlet fields. then dorothy lost heart. she sat down on the grass and looked at her companions and they sat down and looked at her and toto found that for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly that flew past his head. dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck since the queen of the mice had given it to her. asked the girl anxiously. these she thought must be the charm so she read the directions carefully and put the cap upon her head. she said standing on her left foot. asked the scarecrow who did not know what she was doing. dorothy went on standing this time on her right foot. replied the tin woodman calmly. said dorothy who was now standing on both feet. others took the scarecrow and the woodman and the lion and one little monkey seized toto and flew after them although the dog tried hard to bite him. the scarecrow and the tin woodman were rather frightened at first for they remembered how badly the winged monkeys had treated them before but they saw that no harm was intended so they rode through the air quite cheerfully and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them. dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest monkeys one of them the king himself. they had made a chair of their hands and were careful not to hurt her. she asked. perhaps some of us were rather too full of mischief at times flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings chasing birds and throwing nuts at the people who walked in the forest. but we were careless and happy and full of fun and enjoyed every minute of the day. this was many years ago long before oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land. all her magic was used to help the people and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good. everyone loved her but her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise. he laughed when he came to the top of the water and swam in to shore. asked dorothy who had been greatly interested in the story. as his bride could not bear the sight of us he called us all to him in the forest after he had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never again set eyes on a winged monkey which we were glad to do for we were all afraid of her. as the monkey king finished his story dorothy looked down and saw the green shining walls of the emerald city before them. she wondered at the rapid flight of the monkeys but was glad the journey was over. the strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of the city the king bowed low to dorothy and then flew swiftly away followed by all his band. after ringing several times it was opened by the same guardian of the gates they had met before. he asked in surprise. answered the scarecrow. asked the man in wonder. exclaimed the man and he bowed very low indeed before her. then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from the great box on all their eyes just as he had done before. afterward they passed on through the gate into the emerald city. when the people heard from the guardian of the gates that dorothy had melted the wicked witch of the west they all gathered around the travelers and followed them in a great crowd to the palace of oz. the soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door but he let them in at once and they were again met by the beautiful green girl who showed each of them to their old rooms at once so they might rest until the great oz was ready to receive them. they thought the great wizard would send for them at once but he did not. they had no word from him the next day nor the next nor the next. so the scarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another message to oz saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the winged monkeys to help them and find out whether he kept his promises or not. when the wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he sent word for them to come to the throne room at four minutes after nine oclock the next morning. he had once met the winged monkeys in the land of the west and he did not wish to meet them again. dorothy fell asleep only once and then she dreamed she was in kansas where aunt em was telling her how glad she was to have her little girl at home again. of course each one of them expected to see the wizard in the shape he had taken before and all were greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one at all in the room. they kept close to the door and closer to one another for the stillness of the empty room was more dreadful than any of the forms they had seen oz take. asked oz. asked the voice and dorothy thought it trembled a little. exclaimed dorothy. as it fell with a crash they looked that way and the next moment all of them were filled with wonder. our friends looked at him in surprise and dismay. cried dorothy. she asked. declared the little man rubbing his hands together as if it pleased him. asked the lion. asked dorothy. it was a great mistake my ever letting you into the throne room. he led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the throne room and they all followed him. she inquired. as for the ball of fire the false wizard had hung that also from the ceiling. it was really a ball of cotton but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely. so they sat down and listened while he told the following tale. cried dorothy. asked dorothy. it went way up above the clouds so far that a current of air struck it and carried it many many miles away. but i found myself in the midst of a strange people who seeing me come from the clouds thought i was a great wizard. of course i let them think so because they were afraid of me and promised to do anything i wished them to. asked dorothy. i have been good to the people and they like me but ever since this palace was built i have shut myself up and would not see any of them. as it was i lived in deadly fear of them for many years so you can imagine how pleased i was when i heard your house had fallen on the wicked witch of the east. asked the scarecrow. you are learning something every day. a baby has brains but it doesnt know much. the false wizard looked at him carefully. cried the scarecrow. asked the lion anxiously. there is no living thing that is not afraid when it faces danger. asked the tin woodman. it makes most people unhappy. in the meantime you shall all be treated as my guests and while you live in the palace my people will wait upon you and obey your slightest wish. there is only one thing i ask in return for my help such as it is. they agreed to say nothing of what they had learned and went back to their rooms in high spirits. i am going to oz to get my brains at last. the scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the window engaged in deep thought. dorothy looked at him curiously. she asked. asked the tin woodman. so he walked to the throne room and knocked at the door. he asked. replied the woodman who was greatly pleased. answered oz. then the tin woodman went back to his friends who wished him every joy on account of his good fortune. the lion now walked to the throne room and knocked at the door. asked the lion. you know of course that courage is always inside one so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it. the lion hesitated no longer but drank till the dish was empty. asked oz. oz left to himself smiled to think of his success in giving the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion exactly what they thought they wanted. it was easy to make the scarecrow and the lion and the woodman happy because they imagined i could do anything. these were sad days for the little girl although her friends were all quite happy and contented. the scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself. thus each of the little party was satisfied except dorothy who longed more than ever to get back to kansas. she asked eagerly. she inquired. so i believe the best way to get across the desert will be through the air. asked dorothy. exclaimed the girl. if i should go out of this palace my people would soon discover i am not a wizard and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them. when it was all ready oz sent word to his people that he was going to make a visit to a great brother wizard who lived in the clouds. the news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful sight. while i am gone the scarecrow will rule over you. cried the wizard. she was within a few steps of it and oz was holding out his hands to help her into the basket when crack she screamed. shouted everyone and all eyes were turned upward to where the wizard was riding in the basket rising every moment farther and farther into the sky. still for many days they grieved over the loss of the wonderful wizard and would not be comforted. and she also felt sorry at losing oz and so did her companions. the scarecrow was now the ruler of the emerald city and although he was not a wizard the people were proud of him. and so far as they knew they were quite right. the scarecrow sat in the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him. inquired the woodman. said dorothy joyfully. when she brought it into the throne room she spoke the magic words and soon the band of winged monkeys flew in through the open window and stood beside her. but the monkey king shook his head. there has never been a winged monkey in kansas yet and i suppose there never will be for they dont belong there. we shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power but we cannot cross the desert. and with another bow the monkey king spread his wings and flew away through the window followed by all his band. dorothy was ready to cry with disappointment. asked dorothy earnestly. inquired the scarecrow. asked the child. asked dorothy. there are wild beasts in the woods and a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country. i am really a wild beast you know. asked the scarecrow. they asked in surprise. if it wasnt for dorothy i should never have had brains. when the guardian of the gate saw them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful city to get into new trouble. he then opened the gate of the outer wall and they walked forth and started upon their journey. the sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the land of the south. dorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting home and the scarecrow and the tin woodman were glad to be of use to her. they now turned and took a last look at the emerald city. dorothy said nothing. as he said he was a good man even if he was a bad wizard. the first days journey was through the green fields and bright flowers that stretched about the emerald city on every side. they slept that night on the grass with nothing but the stars over them and they rested very well indeed. in the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood. he walked up to another tree as he spoke but its branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again. at once the tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain and the tin woodman passed safely under it. he shouted to the others. the four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came to the farther edge of the wood. then to their surprise they found before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china. it was smooth like the surface of a dish and higher than their heads. asked dorothy. the lion also curled himself up to sleep and toto lay beside him. after a time the ladder was finished. it looked clumsy but the tin woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose. the scarecrow climbed up the ladder first but he was so awkward that dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from falling off. just as the scarecrow had done. then toto came up and immediately began to bark but dorothy made him be still. as soon as they looked over the wall. when they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall they looked down and saw a strange sight. these houses were quite small the biggest of them reaching only as high as dorothys waist. asked dorothy. they found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up so the scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet. a little farther on dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young princess who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run away. dorothy wanted to see more of the princess so she ran after her. asked the girl. he has broken himself so often that he is mended in a hundred places and doesnt look at all pretty. said the princess. exclaimed dorothy. they walked carefully through the china country. however by carefully picking their way they got safely along until they reached solid ground. they walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther. dorothy and toto and the lion lay down to sleep while the woodman and the scarecrow kept watch over them as usual. when morning came they started again. asked the lion quietly. it is a most tremendous monster like a great spider with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a tree trunk. the lion thought for a moment. he asked. inquired the lion. asked the lion. he bade his comrades goodbye and marched proudly away to do battle with the enemy. the great spider was lying asleep when the lion found him and it looked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust. its legs were quite as long as the tiger had said and its body covered with coarse black hair. this gave the lion a hint of the best way to attack the creature and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awake he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the monsters back. then with one blow of his heavy paw all armed with sharp claws he knocked the spiders head from its body. then the beasts bowed down to the lion as their king and he promised to come back and rule over them as soon as dorothy was safely on her way to kansas. so he led the way and the others followed. asked the scarecrow. but he had no arms at all and seeing this the scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a creature could prevent them from climbing the hill. as quick as lightning the mans head shot forward and his neck stretched out until the top of the head where it was flat struck the scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling over and over down the hill. again a head shot swiftly out and the great lion went rolling down the hill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball. she asked. inquired the king of the monkeys bowing low. asked the child. they told who they were and the girl soldier went into the castle. after a few moments she came back to say that dorothy and the others were to be admitted at once. she was both beautiful and young to their eyes. her dress was pure white but her eyes were blue and they looked kindly upon the little girl. she asked. asked the scarecrow. he leaned on his axe and thought a moment. cried the scarecrow. the silver shoes took but three steps and then she stopped so suddenly that she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where she was. at length however she sat up and looked about her. she cried. for the silver shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air and were lost forever in the desert. and oh aunt em and it was told him that concobar with his chief lords would visit the castle. but in the midst of the feast an old magician who was of those that had come with the king stood up before the great gathering. then did a cry of fear burst from those gathered to the feast and leaping to their feet each man laid his hand upon his sword for the word that the wise man had spoken would it not come to pass therefore if it please the king let my daughter die and so may peace yet reign in the realm. but the answer of king concobar came not for a time. still was the hand of each upon his sword when the king spake. bend not thy mind to the death of thine own child. let the babe live. at these words arose a prince. deep within the forest beyond the moor of loneliness shall her childish days be spent. and if with the maiden come sorrow then be that sorrow upon me and not upon the land. cried the people. and deep within the forest beyond the moor of loneliness did the king command that a cottage be built and when deirdre was one year thither was she sent with a trusted nurse. once each week did the king visit the fair babe and daily were stores of food and milk brought to the lone dwelling. it was she who told to deirdre the old tales of knights and ladies of dragons and of fairies that dwelt in the enchanted land. one white winters morning deirdre looked from her window and saw lying in the snow a calf. as deirdre watched the flow of the scarlet stream a raven black as night flew down and drank of the warm blood. then deirdre smiled. cried deirdre. then move slowly on your way but speak to none whom ye may meet and when ye leave the wood let not your lips tell those things ye shall have seen and heard. let us wander forth. and as deirdre gazed she saw as in a dream the forms of three men come slowly through the forest. deirdre started. yonder walks not a man with skin white as snow with cheek crimson as blood nor with hair black as the ravens wing. you lie and the maid made haste and she reached the men and stood before them. speak she again cried. tell him that tomorrow an hour before the setting of the sun he will find her by this well. and deirdre ran with great speed to the well but no man was there and she waited long but none came. and lo and nathos came out to her and she told him of the loneliness of the fair deirdre and of her longing to see him. the maiden paused. the horn ceased. no mortal art thou. yet it is death should the king know of my desire. it is for thee i have watched long for is not thy skin white as snow thy cheek crimson as blood and thy hair black as the ravens wing i love thee deirdre and i would serve thee ever. i love thee nathos and i would that i might be ever by thy side. and a fair land it is. in fear and wonder deirdre ran to the spot. she saw too the tracks that marked his escape. then went he forward and told his waiting huntsmen to return by a long and winding path to the castle of the sons of usna. and now nathos was glad. i ask none to share the sorrow that may come said nathos. yet lest the king should follow me hither and finding me not seek to slay you were it not well that ye leave this place if sorrow come upon thee let it be upon us also. are we not the children of one mother and if death come let us face it together like men. but when deirdre heard how the sons of usna would thus face death for her sake she sighed aloud. it is not for me to bring sorrow upon the land. and nathos brow grew dark. the hand that lit the fire is none other than the hand of concobar the king. the scent of the sea and the gleam of its blue waters and dancing waves made them strong and glad and free. in it sailed twenty men with their chief. this day have we travelled far and would fain rest. bring her rather to my castle and there let her rest in safety with my wife and her maidens. and as they set sail he asked how many men the sons of usna had with them. nathos that man would fain steal me from you and deliver you into the hands of concobar. then the hundred and fifty men whom nathos had brought with him sent he back to their own green isle. here may deirdre and i with a few followers dwell alone in safety. all through the winter they dwelt in peace and content. on the summit of a high hill stood the castle where she had once dwelt. this nathos who had stolen deirdre from the forest beyond the moor of loneliness should no longer be suffered to live in peace. and the king made a feast so magnificent that such had never been seen in the green isle. again the king called to him a warrior prince. to him he spake as to the first. the bloom of early summer made bright the earth and nathos and his brothers had not yet left their fathers home for the castle in the north. again a loud cry and the sons of usna were called by name. let us play on. he asked. but before the brothers could answer deirdre spake. that night all rejoiced save deirdre. and when deirdre stood once more on the soil of her own land then was her heart glad and for a brief space she remembered not her fears or her dreams. turn aside and let us go not to concobar or that thing which i saw in my dream it shall come to pass. and on the morrow they came to the great palace. and as deirdre rested the door opened and there entered a messenger from the king. both have ye taken from him and here within these walls are ye now in his power. of a sudden deirdre spake her gaze fixed as if on some strange thing. i see as in a dream. alas it is but for the beauty of a woman that these brave ones perish. that which shall come shall come. and the man went. and a great warrior hearing the thunder came riding across the plain and in his hand he held a magic sword with blade of blue. i would that mine enemy had fought me fair said the dying man. asked the stranger. it was at that hour that nathos kissed deirdre and went forth from the house. therefore i would that thou wouldst help me by thy magic power. and the magic sea rose higher and yet more high so that nathos raised deirdre on his shoulder and there she rested her white arms around the heros neck. and concobar commanded that they should be slain before his eyes. with that they laid their heads upon the block. and all were glad save lir. but at length a great sorrow fell upon him for his wife who was dear unto him died and she had been ill but three days. tell lir i am his friend as ever and ask that he come with you hither. when these words were told to lir his heart was glad. choose her whom thou wilt. yet another year passed and again twins were born but before the infant boys knew their mother she died. kill them and great wealth shall be yours. onward they drove out of the gloomy pass into the bright sunlight of the white road. all was colour and sunshine scent and song as the children of lir drove onward to their doom. and with the wand she touched the shoulder of each. and lo as she touched finola the maiden was changed into a snowwhite swan and behold and swimming on the lone lake were four white swans. stay stay with us. then with the dim dawn silence stole over the lake. stern and sad rang the answer of lir. awful was his voice as he pronounced her doom. from hunger too the swans suffered. therefore let us say where we may hope to meet when the storm is spent. and with the dawn fell calm. swift as her tired wings would bear her finola sailed to the rocky isle where she hoped to find her brothers. but alas no sign was there of one of them. then to the highest summit of the rocks she flew. as the last notes died finola raised her eyes and lo and as she looked behold for long they were silent but at length finola spake. of their loneliness of soul of that she could not speak. glad then and of great comfort were the hearts of finola and her brothers. and as they flew finola sang and faint floated her voice over the kneeling host. yet was lir glad that his children were alive and he thought of the day when the magic spell would be broken and those so dear to him would be freed from their bitter woe. and she too would fain have died. trust in him and he will yet save you. when the children of lir awoke behold there they alighted and gazed each at the other but too great for speech was their joy. then again did they spread their wings and fly above the green grass on and on until they reached the hills and trees that surrounded their old home. but alas only the ruins of lirs dwelling were left. slowly passed the years but a great longing filled the hearts of the children of lir. no longer did it strike terror into the hearts of the children of lir rather as a note of peace did it sink into their souls. and no need had the saint to ask whether these indeed were the children of lir. rather did he give thanks to the high god who had brought him hither. these words the four white swans heard with great joy and coming to the shore they placed themselves under the care of the saint. and he led them to his cell and there they dwelt with him. dear to him were they dear as though they had been his own children. and that same night she set out for her fathers kingdom in the south. but the messenger returned without the birds. but he found the saint in the little church and before the altar were the four white swans. asked the king. and in great fear did the saint follow. but lo as they reached the door the snowwhite feathers of the four swans fell to the ground and the children of lir were delivered from their doom. but aged and feeble were the children of lir. wrinkled were their once fair faces and bent their little white bodies. heavy with sorrow are our hearts that we must part from thee thou holy one and that in loneliness must thy days on earth be spent. but such is the will of the high god. but ere the business of the day was begun it was told that two warriors were without and would talk with the king. on his right hand sat finn and on his left the queen. and next the queen sat grania. and now was finn come hither to seek her for his wife. at length she turned again to the chief who sat next her. and the chief told his name and sang his praise. and the chief told his name and sang his praise. afterwards grania sought of the chief the names of many of the nobles and he told her and he told too of the deeds they had done. and the king drank from it and also the queen. and it was not long until a deep sleep had fallen upon all who had drunk. grania then rose slowly from her seat and crossed the hall to where dermat sat for dermat of those nobles that finn brought with him pleased her the best. my heart went out to thee that day and now do i know that thee only do i love. and having spoken thus grania went forth from the hall. and there grania met him. then dermat did as grania said and he brought the horses and the chariot and they drove forth. and dermat when he saw that the princess would not be moved told her how great was his love for her and how he would defend her even with his life from the wrath of finn. and there grania rested and there did dermat bring to her food of the forest and water from a clear spring. when finn found that grania had fled with dermat great was his wrath and he called to him his nobles and ordered them with all speed to follow in the track of dermat and grania. then was the wrath of finn so great that he said he would hang his nobles and not one would he spare if they did not again find the track and that with all speed. so being sore afraid they crossed the river and when they had searched they saw the horses one on either side and they found too the spot where dermat and grania had turned from the river. now among the nobles were those who loved dermat and would fain save him from the hate of finn. and they called the hound and told him secretly what he should do. and going in he found dermat and grania asleep and he thrust his head into dermats bosom. then dermat awoke his wife and told her that finn was near. still grania feared greatly but she spake no further for in dermats eyes she read his gloom. for dermat had cleared a space round his hut and around the space had he built the strong fence. then the nobles climbed a high tree and from it did they look within the fence and there they saw dermat and with him a lady. but for their love of dermat did the nobles hide from finn that they had seen his foe. full well i know that dermat is hid behind yonder strong fence. art thou behind the fence i am here and with me is grania but none other shall come hither save with my leave. now in the circle fence were seven doors and at each door did finn place strong men so that dermat should by no means escape. and grania when she heard finns voice was filled with fear and she trembled greatly. then dermat kissed her three times and bade her be of good cheer for all would yet be well. but dermat answered i seek the door guarded by finn and by none other shall i leave this place. then to the third to the fourth and to the fifth door did dermat go and at each was he told how the men without were willing to fight to the death for their love of him. and he went to the seventh door and asked who was without. and no man dared to follow dermat. when grania saw dermat her heart leaped for joy. though he were one hundred years old yet would he be but thirty so soon as he had eaten three of the fairy berries. one eye one red eye gleamed from the middle of his black forehead. and dermat told the giant how he would fain build a hut in the forest and hunt amid the woods. so dermat built a hut near to a clear well and there he and grania lived in peace for many days eating the food of the forest and drinking water from the spring. and when he asked them who they were and whence they came they told how they were enemies that would fain make peace. so they left the palace and journeyed without rest until they came to dermats hut by the clear well. now dermat when he heard footsteps without seized his weapons and going to the door asked of the strangers who they were and whence they came. then dermat said i am not willing to give you my head nor will you find it an easy matter to take it. and he struck the giant a mighty blow to awake him. then dermat sat down to rest. and when they had come back he sent for the princess. so dermat plucked the berries and grania ate and was satisfied. and this he said as though they were free men. they thanked the hero for his words and also for the berries which they could not have got of themselves. then dermat who had watched the game from among the branches overhead spoke aloud to himself the move that should be played. and grania sat by her husband ill at ease. and this time the nobles raised a mighty cheer. and they looked up and through an opening in the branches they beheld dermat kiss grania three times for the princess was in great fear. and he offered great reward to any man that would go up into the tree and bring to him the heros head or force him to come down. and he went up. then nine times did a man of finns army climb the tree and nine times was he thrown to earth and killed by his own friends. and she was a witch. now it chanced on the day that they came thither that dermat hunted alone in the wood. and so sure was his aim that it reached the witch through the leaf and she fell to the ground dead. and there were born unto them one daughter and four sons. now it fell on a day after many years that grania sat as one in a dream. and dermat because of the love he bore grania granted her wish and for a year they were making ready for the great feast. dermat lay down but ere long he again heard the hounds voice. but again grania begged him to lie down and to give no heed to the matter. so dermat lay down and fell into a light sleep and when the hound awakened him the third time it was broad day. and he did not rest till he came to the summit of a hill where he found finn and of him he asked the meaning of the chase. dermat knew no fear of the wild boar and he would not leave the summit of the hill where he stood. so dermat stood alone on the summit of the hill and he knew well it was that he might meet his death that finns men did hunt the boar this day. then as the boar came rushing up the face of the hill dermat let loose his good hound but it seeing the fearful monster fled before him. but it fell harmless to the ground doing the monster no hurt. but so deep was the wound in dermats side that when finn came to him he found the hero near unto death. asked finn. then one of the nobles hearing these words prayed finn that he would let dermat drink from his hands. finn replied i know not of any well on this hill whence i can bring water. no more than nine paces must thou go to reach it. let me i pray thee drink from thine hands. then finn went to the well and in his two hands tightly together did he bring the water towards dermat. i pray thee go once more to the well and bring me to drink or i die. then were raised three long cries of sorrow for dermat who had been dear unto them all. so finn and his nobles left the hill finn leading dermats hound. then they once more followed the king. at length when silence had fallen upon her grief grania arose and ordered that five hundred men should go to the hill and bring to her the body of dermat. then turning to finn she begged of him to leave with her dermats hound. and finn would not. but a noble hearing that grania wished the hound took him from the hand of finn and gave him to the princess. for though i cannot bring him back to life yet each day shall he speak with me for some space. our children

fanny started off early one morning like little red riding hood to visit her grandmother who lives quite at the other end of the village. she went straight on her way and did not see any wolf. they have many things to say to each other for one of them is at the end of lifes voyage and the other is just setting out upon it. just look grandmother however as her habit is eats standing near the corner of the hearth. when they are through with their little talk grandmother gives fanny an apple and some bread. and fanny goes out into the yard where there are trees and grass and flowers and little birds. fanny did not believe there was a prettier yard than this in all the world. already she takes her knife from her pocket to cut her bread as the village people do. fanny could not guess at first what they all wanted. but her heart heard the little birds and she threw them crumbs that scarcely touched the earth before they caught them in the air. fanny saw that the birds were not all of the same nature. they hardly heard her. one is not always heard when one speaks of justice. no matter how she tried she fed the fat at the expense of the thin. it made her very sorry
simple child that she was she did not know it was the way of the world. be a good girl always. she kissed her but fanny stood a while very thoughtful at the threshold. and fanny went away across the fields toward home. she could see the chimney of her house smoking in the distance against the red sunset sky. they loved each other dearly these two. they had been following her. its time to go to bed now. thus fanny came back home to her mother followed by bird music in the air. she slept. she slept and dreamed. she saw the blue bird flying toward the castle of his love. she knew she was not a princess and couldnt expect visits from a prince changed into a bird the color of deep sky. such an one if she should find him she would give not only bread but cakes and kisses too. she would like to see him. and now she does see him all of a sudden he grows bigger and longer his wings change into two arms. she is alone in the little room. they have come from everywhere from greece and rome and blue distant countries to dance with one another. it would not be very amusing to wear a heros dress if you had to show his courage too. the hearts of heroes are torn in all sorts of ways. for the most part they are famous through their misfortunes. if any of them lived happily they are not remembered now. you feel grand just by wearing them. they are going to strike up this piece. there is nothing so pleasant as to see them with their little stiff bodies and their heads so erect. on the other hand she is very well up in sacred history. she would be more surprised to hear that they did not talk any more. and she is right too. animals have always talked and always will talk but they talk only to their friends. to be understood there is nothing like sympathy. mary

and scolded and darted at miss mary seizing her by the arm. there miss mary sits surprised and astonished and thinks it all over. they are large the earth and sky and can amuse a little girl for a while. we must not laugh at her for that one cant learn everything at once. that is why one grows tired of it in spite of its beauty. pan pipes 
three children of the same village peter james and john are standing up looking off at something. it is as god wishes it to be. but what are his two comrades doing they are gazing off into space all three of them. at what the servants from the farm and the mill were pale with longing peter and james were red with joy. little john lost his tongue. everything in the wagon seemed beautiful and precious to them. he has mounted his horse. why it would be hard to say. this red horse was a present from a poor man and maybe there is some secret grace in the gifts of the poor. he is quite far away. little or great we all ride. the sun is shining and the two children sing. they sing like the nightingale because their hearts are gay. the lips that sing them lose their color and are silent one after the other but the songs are always on the wing. it is fear. hes a fierce dog the pig mans. and he is afraid to be afraid. it must be admitted that with no ladies or young maidens in the world men might be less brave. catherines day 
five oclock and miss catherine is receiving her dolls. it is her day at home. the dolls dont talk the little genius that gave them smiles refused them speech. it must have been done for the good of the world for if dolls could talk people would listen to no one else. miss catherine talks for her visitors as well as for herself. she makes the questions and gives the answers. very well madame. oh thats good. and how is your little girl oh what a pity you know madame i had two children last week really that makes four. four or five i dont know which. when you have so many you get confused. you have a very pretty dress on. every evening. i my dear go to a dance every day. thats very amusing. you are as pretty as heart could wish today little one. i like the snow because its so white. oh but this is black snow. that is wrong. but catherine has found this out herself. the little sea dogs 

they are little sailors real little sea dogs every one. their hearts too are of the same stuff as their fathers simple patient and full of courage. since they came into the world they have been simple and big of heart. who has made them so that is why the little sailors in their childish hearts bear such brave thoughts. the little lame prince 
chapter i.
he was the most beautiful prince that ever was born. being a prince people said this and it was true. all the people in the palace were beautifully dressed in the clothes which the queen had given them. everything went on as if she had been present. she picked him up the accident was so slight it seemed hardly worth speaking of. the baby had turned pale but did not cry. no one knew that anything was wrong. it would have been a pity to let anything trouble such a day. such a procession said a shrill but soft and not unpleasant voice and a person no larger than a child was seen. i know her majesty well and i love her and her child. and since you dropped him on the marble stairs i choose to take him for my own. cried the group laughing. the little old woman paid no attention and her soft grey eyes were fixed on the prince who smiled back at her. everybody started. they listened. the queen her majesty was dead. when the little prince was carried back to his mothers room there was no mother to kiss him. as for his godmother the little old woman in grey nobody knew what became of her. chapter ii. it could not be said that the prince missed his mother children of his age cannot do that but somehow after she died everything seemed to go wrong with him. this happened so many times that at last people began to talk about it. a prince and not able to stand on his legs what a misfortune to the country no one talked of this to the king for he was very sad. the king desired that the prince should keep the name given him by the little old woman in grey and so he was known as dolor. only once when the king and his brother were sitting together with prince dolor playing in a corner of the room dragging himself about with his arms rather than his legs it seemed to strike the father that all was not right with his son. said he suddenly to the nurse. the prince turned to his father a small sweet grave face like his mothers and the king smiled and held out his arms. they came and agreed in what had been pretty well known before that the prince must have been hurt when he was an infant. did anybody remember no nobody. soon after he said this the king died as suddenly and quietly as the queen had done and prince dolor was left without either father or mother as sad a thing as could happen even to a prince. he was more than that now though. he was a king. if anybody had said that prince dolors uncle was cruel he would have said that what he did was for the good of the country. soon after he obtained an order to send the king away which was done in great state. they brought the coffin back in great state and buried him with his parents. chapter iii. and what of the little lame prince whom everybody seemed so easily to have forgotten not everybody. not a bush not a tree not a resting place for bird or beast in that dreary plain. it was not a pleasant place to live. the only sign that human creatures had ever been near the spot was a large round tower which rose up in the centre of the plain. its height was nearly a hundred feet. whatever mystery there was about the tower it and the sky and the plain kept to themselves. this in order that she might take the utmost care of him for those who put him there were equally afraid of his dying and of his living. and yet he was only a little gentle boy with a sweet smile. he was very tired with his long journey and was clinging to the mans neck for he was rather frightened. the tired little boy was prince dolor. he was not dead at all. the man descended the ladder took it to pieces and disappeared across the plain. he always saw the prince so as to make sure that the child was alive and well and then went away until the following month. his nurse was very kind to him though she was a wicked woman. perhaps it made her better to be shut up with an innocent child. byandby he began to learn lessons not that his nurse had been ordered to teach him but she did it partly to amuse herself. she was not a stupid woman and prince dolor was by no means a stupid child so they got on very well. as they told him of the things in the outside world he longed to see them. from this time a change came over the boy. he began to look sad and thin and to shut himself up for hours without speaking. his nurse had been forbidden on pain of death to tell him anything about himself. he had been reading one day but feeling all the while that to read about things which you never can see is like hearing about a beautiful dinner while you are starving. not a very cheerful view just the plain and the sky but he liked it. he used to think if he could only fly out of that window up to the sky or down to the plain how nice it would be perhaps when he died his nurse had told him once in anger that he would never leave the tower till he died he might be able to do this. asked prince dolor in surprise. the little old woman sighed and glanced down at his legs and feet which he did not know were different from those of other children and then to his sweet bright face. it was i who gave you yours and you will belong to me all your days. so they sat down and played and talked together. asked the little old woman. his godmother took him in her arms and kissed him. i only want you. when the door opened prince dolor shut his eyes opening them again nobody but his nurse was in the room as his godmother had melted away. said she kicking a little bundle that lay beside them. chapter iv. it seemed but a mere piece of cloth dark green in color being worn and shabby though not dirty. prince dolor examined it curiously spread it out on the floor then arranged it on his shoulders. it felt comfortable but was the only shabby thing the prince had ever seen in his life. after a time he nearly forgot the cloak and his godmother. sometimes though he recalled her sweet pleasant face but as she never came she gradually slipped out of his memory until something happened which made him remember her and want her as he had never wanted anything before. even when a little better he was too weak to enjoy anything but lay all day alone. why cant i walk like my nurse. it would be very nice to move about quickly or fly like a bird. how nice it must be to be a bird. if legs are no good why can one not have wings i am so tired and no one cares for me except perhaps my godmother. how glad he was to see her. prince dolor blushed. the old woman laughed very sweetly. old and shabby asked the prince with tears in his eyes. she touched his poor little legs. though he did not wholly understand he began to guess what his godmother meant. now he began to understand that we cannot always have things as we want them but as they are and that we must learn to bear them and make the best of them. you may give me any name you please but i am your godmother. said she to prince dolor. the prince burst into a fit of laughing. it all seemed so exceedingly silly and his godmother laughed too. alas it was not there. though he seldom played with them now he liked just to feel they were there. they were all gone and with them the traveling cloak. oh godmother forgive me ill never be so careless again. ill never be so careless again. i dont know what the cloak is exactly but i am sure it is something precious. help me to find it again. laughed a silvery voice. it is of no use to anybody except the owner. his dear old godmother he thought and turned eagerly round. prince dolor darted towards it tumbling several times on the way. the prince watched it rather anxiously it was such an extraordinary thing. as it was he could only show his courage by being afraid of nothing and by doing boldly all that was in his power. as if my dear godmother would ever have given me anything to hurt me. but there he sat waiting for what might happen next. he repeated them laughing all the while they seemed such nonsense. prince dolor had never felt such delicious sensation before. the happiness of the prince cannot be described when he got out of hopeless tower and found himself for the first time in the pure open air with the sky above him and the earth below. true there was nothing but earth and sky no houses no trees no rivers mountains seas not a beast on the ground or a bird in the air. so that when he began to count them he was utterly bewildered. the poor little prince began to feel frightened. instantly the words came to him and he repeated them. the cloak began to turn slowly and immediately started back as fast as ever in the direction of the tower. he had scarcely reached the floor when he heard his nurses voice outside. what has become of your royal highness all this time prince what can you be thinking of but he did not mind what she said. she brought in the supper and lit the candles her face as unhappy as usual. and all this while the happy little fellow was away floating in the air on his magic cloak and seeing all sorts of wonderful things or they seemed wonderful to him who had hitherto seen nothing at all. how i should take care of them too he cried to his dear godmother whom he felt sure had sent them. he amused himself for ever so long gazing down upon the grass every square foot of which was a mine of wonders. then just to rest his eyes he turned them up to the sky at which he had looked so often and seen nothing. looking at it through his spectacles he discovered that it was a long string of birds flying one after the other their wings moving steadily and their heads pointed in one direction as steadily as if each were a little ship. cried the boy who had read a little about them. the cloak gave a sudden bound forward and he found himself high up in the air in the very midst of the birds. cried the boy. i do so want to see the world but the birds flew past and the boy looked after them with envy. then he settled himself down in the centre of the cloak feeling quite sad and lonely. with a rather heavy heart. the more he had the more he wanted. he paid no attention to the toys which were brought as he considered himself a big boy. what a lot of things there are that i should like to do but first i should like to go and see the world. apparently it was his godmothers plan always to let him try and try hard before he gained anything. cried he when the cloak stirred itself with a slight slow motion as if waiting his orders. cried prince dolor in great excitement. said he. i must go forward and see the world but oh still i dont much mind im a prince and ought to be able to stand anything. he ate his dinner until he grew so thirsty he did not know what to do. he considered this a difficult request to grant for he was so far from the ground that he could not expect to find a well. he forgot one thing the rain. and it was so fresh so pure as water from the clouds always is that he drank it with the greatest delight. also as soon as it was empty the rain filled it again so that he was able to wash his face and hands. then the sun came out and dried him in no time. the next minute he was sound asleep. when he awoke he found himself floating over a country quite unlike anything he had ever seen before. it had nothing in it grand or lovely was simply pretty nothing more yet to prince dolor who had never seen beyond the level plain it appeared wonderful. first there was a river which came tumbling down the hillside. all this the boy saw either with his own naked eye or through his gold spectacles. he saw also as in a picture beautiful but silent many other things which struck him with wonder especially a grove of trees. only think to have lived to his age and never have seen trees he said. and it contained a pair of silver ears which when he tried them on fitted so exactly over his own that he hardly felt them except for the difference they made in his hearing. the sound which greeted his ears is one which we have heard many times but prince dolor who had lived all his days in the dead silence of hopeless tower heard it for the first time. and oh if you had seen his face. he listened and listened and looked and looked. this creature had only two but they were long straight and strong. it was a boy about the princes own age but oh so different. there was evidently some things which his godmother could or would not give. the boy called to the dog and they started off together for a race across the fields. he said softly thinking that never no never in this world would he be able to do the same. prince dolor sat a good while thus and seemed to grow years older in a few minutes. then he fancied the cloak began to rock gently to and fro with a soothing kind of motion as if he were in somebodys arms somebody who did not speak but loved and comforted him without need of words. he had placed himself so he could see nothing but the sky and had taken off his silver ears as well as his gold spectacles what was the use of either when he had no legs to walk or run up from below there rose a delicious sound. you have heard it hundreds of times my children and so have i. when i was a child i thought there was nothing so sweet and i think so still. but instead of dropping to the ground it dropped right into the little boys breast. when he came in sight of hopeless tower a painful thought struck him. fly away my darling the dear little lark it had not flown away after all but had remained about the tower and he listened to its singing and went to sleep very happy. after this journey which had given the prince so much pain his desire to see the world had somehow faded away. he contented himself with reading his books and looking out of the tower windows and listening to his beloved little lark which had come home with him that day and had never left him again. all during the winter the little bird cheered and amused him. prince dolor was now a big boy. not tall alas the boy was not a stupid boy either. he could learn almost anything he chose and he did choose which was more than half the battle. he never gave up his lessons until he had learned them all never thought it a punishment that he had to work at them and that they cost him a deal of trouble sometimes. the princes i read about generally turn into kings. the woman stood perplexed beyond expression. so long a time had passed by since her crime if it were a crime and her sentence that she now seldom thought of either. she had even grown used to her punishment. and the little prince whom she at first hated she had learned to love at least enough to feel sorry for him. then the idea came to her what harm would it be even if he did know his own history something might happen who could tell prince dolor started. lame as he was anybody could see he was born to be a king. said the nurse as he was beginning to speak. how his parents had died how his uncle had stolen the throne and sent him to end his days in this lonely tower. for somehow boy as he was when he heard he was born to be a king he felt like a man like a king who could afford to be tender because he was strong. things more important were in his mind. the people might only laugh at me but still i might show them i could do something. at any rate i might go and see if there was anything for me to do. it was so long since he had asked for help that he was hardly surprised when he got no answer. he shouted as he passed it on the wing. sing to old nurse until i come back again. but as the cloak hung motionless in air he suddenly remembered that he had not made up his mind where to go indeed he did not know and there was nobody to tell him. this journey was not for pleasure as before. he was not a baby now to do nothing but play. men work this much prince dolor knew. after some time he heard a murmur in the distance and stretching his chin over the edge of the cloak prince dolor saw far far below him yet with his gold spectacles and silver ears on he could distinctly hear and see a great city suppose you were to see a large city from the upper air where with your ears and eyes open you could take in everything at once. what would it look like how would you feel about it i hardly know myself. do you prince dolor was as bewildered as a blind person who is suddenly made to see. he gazed down on the city below him and then put his hand over his eyes. and i dont understand it not one bit. i am well acquainted with the king the queen and the little princes and princesses also the maids of honor and all the inhabitants of the city. one half the people seemed so happy and contented and the other half were so poor and miserable. the room was so little that no one cared to use it. asked the puzzled boy. there were a number of sparkling rings on the tiny yellow hands the eyes were shut and the nose looked sharp and thin and the long grey beard hid the mouth and lay over the breast. whispered prince dolor. he had been angry ever since he learned how his uncle had taken the crown and had felt as if king as he was he should like to strike him this great strong wicked man. why you might as well have struck a baby how helpless he lay with his eyes shut and his idle hands folded they had no more work to do bad or good. asked the prince. no there was not the least use in being angry with him now. on the contrary the prince felt almost sorry for him. it will be such fun. the murmur now and then rose into a shout and the shout into a roar. when prince dolor quietly floating in the upper air caught the sound of their different and opposite cries it seemed to him as if the whole city had gone mad together. such were the shouts which came up to him and then began oh what a scene prince dolor saw it all. things happened so fast after one another that he nearly lost his senses. next morning when prince dolor awoke he perceived that his room was empty. very uncomfortable he felt of course and just a little frightened. especially when he began to call again and again but nobody answered. he called out. what has happened i wonder he sprang out of bed and crawled from room to room on his knees. thought he and sat down in the middle of the floor half inclined to believe that it would be better to give up entirely lay himself down and die. this feeling however did not last long. he jumped up and looked out of the window. no help there. he has come and gone taking nurse with him. poor nurse that was prince dolors first thought. for the second time he tried to dress himself and then to do everything he could for himself even to sweeping the hearth and putting on more coals. he then thought of his godmother. not of calling her or asking her to help him she had evidently left him to help himself and he was determined to try his best to do it being a very proud and independent boy but he remembered her tenderly. on the sixth day prince dolor had a strange contented look in his face. so he made up his mind to die. not that he wished to die on the contrary there was a great deal that he wished to live to do. not pleasant music but very bold and grand. the poor condemned woman had not been such a wicked woman after all. it was a bold stroke but it succeeded. people jumped at the idea of this prince who was the son of their late good king and queen. rang from end to end of the kingdom. they were determined to have him reign over them. they hailed him with delight as prince and king and went down on their knees before him offering the crown to him. he held out his arms in eager delight. the little old woman laughed gaily. that is impossible. but now i must go. goodbye prince dolor tried to hold his godmother fast but in vain. a knocking was heard at the door and the little woman vanished. his godmother helped him out of many difficulties for there was never such a wise old woman. therefore other people grew to love him so well that i think hundreds of his subjects might have been found who were almost ready to die for their poor lame king. he did a good many things however which a little astonished his subjects. my people he said i am tired i want to rest it is time for me to go and i do not think i shall come back any more. he drew a little bundle out of his breast pocket. then so suddenly that even those nearest to his majesty could not tell how the king was away floating right up in the air upon something they knew not what. whither he went or who went with him it is impossible to say but i myself believe that his godmother took him on his traveling cloak to the beautiful mountains. we were at college together. shes here for a month. whats the matter betty betty silver smiled. i hope you didnt think it was at you. and i was meaning to have the most lovely time. he may be able to tell me where mervo is. did you ever hear of mervo mr. i do call it hard. scobell. he hasnt spared expense. we have hardly met for years. why he didnt even know where i was. he got up from his chair. she said. betty smiled at her. she drew in her breath softly. betty looked at her in silence for a moment. her eyes opened again. im just jealous thats all. bettys face grew cold. i think youre getting just the least bit hard. i am getting hard. how can i help it do you know how many men have asked me to marry them since i saw you last why should you say that well i do know. she stopped. betty hesitated. why didnt you tell me before betty laughed shortly. i only met him two or three times and i havent seen him for years and i dont suppose i shall ever see him again. betty shook her head. he sat down and opened the book. you want something more modern. its the smallest independent state in the world. here are some facts. so thats where youre going miss silver. he also gives a list of the fish that can be caught there. i last heard of him in london. mervo was looking its best under the hot morning sun. before his arrival mervo had been an island of dreams and slow movement and putting things off till tomorrow. the prince was away at the time. mervo having thought the matter over during these years decided that it had no further use for prince charles. mervo had then gone to sleep again. it was asleep when mr. scobell found it. shake him some more crump. sir theres big money in it for all of us if you and your crowdll sit in. money. no that means change. whats money crump get that and after that the place never looked back. scobells my name. mr. crump obliged once more. a gleam of intelligence came into the presidents dull eye. he nodded once or twice. half a mile away up the side of a mountain. it aint right. youll look around you and the only thing youll miss will be mothers face. asked mr. scobell. let me guess. mr. crump said that that was just it. thats my offer too. goodby squire. glad its settled. he did. certainly a man with money to lose could lose it here under the most charming conditions. each of the rooms was furnished and arranged in a different style. but at present it was being conducted at a loss. he said. miss scobell deep in her paper paid no attention. she was his exact opposite in almost every way. cried mr. scobell. i want to hear that piece you read before. yes. he has caught another fish or something of that sort i think. yes. it doesnt seem right. i am quite nervous myself when i go into the indian room. thats the whole idea of the place that it should be different. we give em variety. whats the use of a republic to a place like this it works by suggestion. thats what this place wants. the prince of this island his highness the prince of mervo. but before he died he married an american girl and theres a son whos in america now living with his uncle. its the son im going to send for. cried mr. scobell. im the man with the big stick in mervo. miss scobell turned to her paper again. said her brother. he was a big young man tall and large of limb. he had a wide goodnatured mouth and a pair of friendly gray eyes. as he passed along the street he looked a little anxious. he cried. it was just great. it was not a task to which many would have looked forward. he thought before he acted but when he acted never yielded a step. john in all the years of their connection had never been able to make anything of him. at first he had been prepared to like him as he liked nearly everybody. as to her happiness that was equally out of his control. during all the years they had spent together he had never mentioned the princes name. it was only lately since he had joined the firm that he had been conscious of any great strain. he was not a man who worried. his soul was sleepy. john was the first of the line who had in him the seeds of better things. the desire for action was growing steadily every day. the spirit of adventure was in him. john went to meet him. john followed him into the room. john met the girls eye as she passed. he said. what claim do you put forward for special consideration john had a feeling that the interview was being taken at too rapid a pace. he felt confused. it was left to me in trust for you by your mother. he said. i decided to wait until in my opinion you had sense enough to use it properly. i do not think that time has arrived. i do not think it will ever arrive. at the door john hesitated. it was as if he had caught a glimpse of something ugly. he stopped. he must have seen johns movement but he continued to write as if he were alone in the room. john turned to the door again. the sun and the breeze had done their work. new york looked different to him. it made him feel positively shy. smith however was not at the office. he had gone out john was informed earlier in the morning to cover a threatened strike somewhere down on the east side. john did not go in search of him. new york is not like other cities. it looked a pretty good hotel to john. a second attempt to find smith next morning failed as the first had done. john was puzzled. but it was the unknown that he was in search of and he decided to see the mysterious stranger. john got up to meet him. said john. the other seemed to miss something in his voice. he asked. john stared. he said. youll be the only man ive ever met who has said a word about him. mr. crumps face cleared. i had not expected this. you have been kept in ignorance. he cried. mr. crump nodded gravely. a horrid doubt seized john. mr. crump appeared wounded. he said. it may be fun to you but it makes me feel a perfect ass. mr. crump felt in his pocket. he said. mr. crump passed them across to him. this suddenly came home to john. who is this mr. scobell how would it be if you were to put me next to one or two facts up till now nothing in particular has ever happened to me. well well these are stirring times. but its a pity. i was just beginning to like this place. he murmured. john looked at him amazed. john reached across the table and seized the secretarys hand. this is no time for delay. one doesnt become a prince every day. a bell boy who met them was addressed by the larger of the two and asked his name. the young man patted him on his shoulder. the palace guards presented arms. it was then seen that the young man was mr. crump. to the band mr. crumps face was strange. they had no reason to suppose that he was not prince john and they acted accordingly. at this point mr. scobell made his presence felt. no thats wrong. mr. scobell was a business man. he wanted his moneys worth. that was what he had had in his mind when he sent for john. john regarded him thoughtfully. he hasnt said anything about a bite of breakfast has he said john turning to mr. scobell. i dont. are you ready no its no good. the magic fire has gone out. break it to em crump. during the early portion of the ride mr. scobell was silent and thoughtful. but he had not enjoyed it. then he cheered up. his face cleared. he said. the place runs itself. have a court see what i mean same as over in england. dont worry about money. thatll be all right. said john. there always is in these good things. but i dont see it yet. the council of state broke up. miss scobell turned a page. her brother started. i never thought of that. but no i guess hes not. hed have mentioned it. hes not the sort to hush up a thing like that. he cried. it just came to me. your saying that put it into my head. do you know what im going to do for once miss scobell showed signs that her brothers conversation really interested her. she laid down her paper and stared at him. why not shes a pretty girl. clever too. isnt that romantic enough for you miss scobell sighed again. i suppose you know best. he began to pace the room. thatll make them take notice by itself. looking back it seemed to him that he had done nothing during that week but enjoy each new aspect of his position as it was introduced to his notice. the days that had followed had been peaceful and amusing. they had been lazy days. his work began at eleven in the morning and finished as a rule at about a quarter after. when he had read it the state asked no more of him until the next morning. no it had been something else that had worked the mischief and in another moment the thing stood revealed beyond all question of doubt. he had been sitting at the dutch table. the light and movement of the place interested him. he had only just settled himself when he was aware of a girl standing beside him. he got up. he had begun and then he saw her face. it had all happened in an instant. how long was it since he had seen her last not more than a couple of years. it seemed centuries. it all came back to him. a college friend of hers had been the sister of a college friend of his. the world had been full of pretty american girls then. but now 
he looked at her. and as he looked he heard america calling to him. it was so with john. it seemed to him as he recalled the scene now that he had loved her before he had had time to frame his first remark. john realized that he was the only person in the room not silent. he stopped and the moment passed. the ball dropped with a rattle. said john. im not playing. i only just stopped to look on. my aunt is in one of the rooms and i want to make her come home. he said as the ball fell. it seems lovely. she was beginning to move off. john made his big effort. id like awfully well to show that to you. she nodded. she said. it was now past ten but still there were no signs of betty. he told himself that she had forgotten. then that she had remembered but had changed her mind. then that she had never meant to come at all. he looked at his watch again and the world grew black. it was twelve minutes after ten. john in his time had thought and read a good deal about love. ever since he had grown up he had wanted to fall in love. this was different. this had nothing to do with moonlight and soft music. it hurt. ill tell you. theres no use talking for half a day before you get to the point. i guess youve heard that theres a prince here instead of a republic now she hesitated. he went on rapidly. thats it. great honor see what i mean princess and all that. betty had not taken her eyes off him from his first word. she said. dont be foolish. i have not seen him but everybody says so. wait till you see him betty. nobodys asking you to marry him before lunch. youll have plenty of time to get acquainted. you give me a pain in the neck. thats how. you dont understand the position of affairs. well youve got another guess coming. if you want to know whos the big noise here its me me this prince guy is my hired man. see who sent for him i did. who put him on the throne i did. now do you understand he knows his job. when i tell him about this marriage do you know what hell say betty shuddered. i wont. she gasped. betty stared at him. no sir. thats the sort of man he is. i guess thats not american enough for you maybe murmured miss scobell. betty uttered a cry. it woke in betty now. but somehow she knew. she cried. said mr. scobell. betty was walking slowly toward the door. something in her face checked mr. scobell. his heart was singing within him. she had come. he was someone. he was the man betty silver had come to meet. her face was pale and cold and hard. she did not speak or smile. as she drew near she looked at him and there was that in her look which set a chill wind blowing through the world and cast a veil across the sun. betty was the first to speak. john searched in his brain for words and came empty away. said betty. they sat down. there seemed no end to him. wherever he looked there were hands and feet and legs. he glanced out of the corner of his eye at betty. she was gazing out to sea. he dived into his brain again. it was absurd there must be something to say. and then he realized that a worse thing had befallen. he had no voice. it had gone. he knew that try he never so hard to speak he would not be able to utter a word. had he ever spoken there were tears in her eyes. she snatched her hand away. she got up quickly. and finding that this was all that he could say was silent. she said sharply. i know. she went on quickly. oh its too horrible that it should be you you who have been you cant understand what you have been to me ever since we met you couldnt understand. i cant tell you a sort of help something something that i cant put it into words. only it used to help me just to think of you. i didnt mind if i never saw you again. i didnt expect ever to see you again. it was just being able to think of you. it helped you were something i could trust. she laughed bitterly. girls are fools. john stood motionless staring at the ground. everythings money. isnt there a man in the world who wont sell himself i thought that you i suppose im stupid. its business i suppose. he did not move. she turned and went slowly up the path. still he made no movement. a spell seemed to be on him. his eyes never left her as she passed into the shadow of the trees. for a moment her white dress stood out clearly. she had stopped. with his whole soul he prayed that she would look back. but she moved on once more and was gone. and suddenly a strange weakness came upon john. he trembled. then his brain cleared and he found himself thinking swiftly. he could not let her go like this. he must stop her. he must speak to her. he must say he did not know what it was that he would say anything so that he spoke to her again. no answer came to his cries. he stood alone in a land of silence and sleep. he was not a man who believed in letting the grass grow under his feet. there was no sense in putting the thing off. the sooner all parties concerned understood the position of affairs the sooner the business would be settled. that betty had not received his information with joy did not distress him. some fool notion of romance of course. not that he was angry. that was all. it was their nature. the only thing to do was to tie a rope to them and let them run around till they were tired of it then pull them in. the present system of one a day was absurd. he made a note to look into the matter. these people wanted waking up. the sound of footsteps came to mr. scobells ears as he approached the room. i been looking for you. mr. scobell was astonished. there might be no need for the iron hand after all. he said. said john. mr. scobell answered question with question. his tone annoyed mr. scobell. john took a step forward. she told me one or two of the things you said and they opened my eyes. until i heard them i had not quite understood my position. i do now. i wouldnt say that sort of thing to a guys face. sure no. you were quite right. i was a fool not to see it before. you might have said much more. there was a knock at the door. i am going back    to america as quickly as i can. i am giving this to a boy to    take to you directly the boat has started. please do not try    to bring me back. john started violently. he cried. mr. scobell nodded sympathy. she sure has it in bad for you. what does she mean why does she say that to you cried mr. scobell. and she turned you down say you and i must get together and do something. the girls mad. see here you arent wise to whats been happening. i fetched you over here and then i fetched betty and i was going to have you two marry. he understood everything now. and then came rage rage such as he had never felt before rage that he had not thought himself capable of feeling. a minute passed. he walked to the window and stood there looking out. this was no place for a man. he swung round and faced mr. scobell. he had made up his mind. john looked at him. the other gasped. gasped mr. scobell. the republic gave it to you. the republics finished. not on your life. not for a minute. see here. i know you dont know what youre saying. but listen here. you must cut out this kind of thing. you mustnt get these ideas in your head. you stick to your job and ill stick to mine. youre a mighty good prince for all thats required of you. dont forget that im the big noise here. see youve had your notice to quit. john had left the room. when he did his remarks were brief and to the point. he gasped. he wanted betty. he wanted to see her and explain. mervo had become a prison. it was obvious that it could only be settled in one way. we asked the soldiers at the door. we asked mr. scobell. said john. i refused it. john spoke again. ive only just found it out its true but its there all right. my actions speak for themselves. you can follow that mervo is no longer running wide open. but i have observed your people sir. cried john. i want to be shown. im not. its a mighty serious thing for me. i want to get away. john was in no mood to supply them. his patience was exhausted. if it doesnt strike you as a satisfactory reason thats up to you. do what you like about it. on the following morning there came a note from mr. scobell. it was brief. john tore it up. johns knowledge of french was not profound but he could understand this and it annoyed him. the rest of that day and the whole of the next passed without sensation. after breakfast on the following morning mr. crump paid a visit to the palace. john was glad to see him. hes mad clean through. im crazy to get back to america. i dont blame you crump because it was not your fault but by george he rose to his feet as the sound of agitated voices came from the other side of the door. excitement seemed to be in the air. cried john. get busy this is where you make your big play. never mind the chorus gentlemen in the passage. whats he talking about said john. mr. crump looked grave. the palace guards have gone over to the people. ill catch that. i can manage it comfortably. ill go up and pack my grip. he stopped. john patted him on the shoulder. come along crump. the window of the room looked out on to a square. a broad smile spread over his face. from their manner i gather that i am no longer needed on this throne. speed them up old man. tell them to make up their minds on the jump because i want to catch that boat. yes or no. there was a moments surprised silence when mr. crump had spoken. and at once the cry was taken up on all sides. i knew you could get a move on as quick as anyone else if you gave your minds to it. its a model to every country in the world. but i guess we must close down the entertainment now or i shall be missing the boat. will you tell them crump that any citizen who cares for a drink and a cigar will find it in the palace. and now i really must be going. ive run it mighty fine. she would not go back. she could not. but that settled what then what was she to do they sell they do not give. and for what they sell they demand a heavy price. betty faced the problem. what had she what could she give that certainly. the world was a market and the only independent people in it were those who had a market value. what was her market value what could she do she had a little of most things enough of nothing. yet such is the magic of tears that it was at this very moment that betty was beginning to be conscious of a distinct change for the better. much water had flowed beneath the bridge since those days. many things had happened to the child. the world knew nothing of this. instead she ran to the old lady and kissed her. and as to what had happened after that memory was vague. she married him within a year. her mind was like a country in the grip of civil war. and held her back and between the two she fell. she did not expect great things. she could not have said exactly what she did expect. it led somewhere. she had been so satisfied with it so content to keep him a mere memory. gradually betty had come to the conclusion that love in the full sense of the word was one of the things that did not happen. at the door she paused for a moment then knocked. she exclaimed. she felt curiously at home and pity for the loneliness of this strange old woman caused her to forget her own troubles. she continued to look closely at her. she asked without looking up. betty had a feeling that the ground was being cut from beneath her feet. she had expected to have to explain who she was and why she had come and behold both were unnecessary. and then the obvious explanation occurred to her. she asked. betty began to read. she said at last. every one of them every one of them she was muttering to herself. she muttered again. bettys eyes filled. she made no reply. im not going to press you. betty could bear it no longer. she cried. she felt the old womans eyes upon her but she could not stop. instantly the rest began to do the same till the room was full of the noise. it was a changed voice that spoke. betty looked up and saw that the eyes that met hers were very soft. she moved quickly to the old womans side. betty when i was your age i ran away from a man because i loved him. i think he was fond of me but father was poor and her folks were the great people of the place and he married her. betty pressed her hand. it was trembling. and i killed it. theres only one way. work work ah i worked i never rested. for two years. two whole years. it fought back at me. it tore me to bits. but i wouldnt stop. the old woman began to speak again. your hearts tearing you. dont let it it will get worse and worse if you are afraid of it. fight it kill it there was silence for a long moment. she asked suddenly. she could not speak. what can you do blessed word ill give you a letter to him. i dont know how much he will offer you but take it and work youll find him pleasant. youll find him pleasant. take it to him now. betty thanked her and turned to go. the interview was plainly at an end. everything seemed much as usual in the city. he had intended to do big things with peaceful moments. theres money in it. before they parted he had come to terms with him. they spoiled the whole thing. the thing began to bore mr. scobell. but at last the work had told upon him. his appearance to those who did not know him hardly suggested this. he was very tall and thin with a dark solemn face. mr. renshaw interested him. oh ah yes mr. renshaw looked annoyed. it looked good to me. a noble scheme. me for it. mr. renshaw looked at him sharply. smiths face was solemn and thoughtful. well well many people do. yes. mr. renshaw wrinkled his forehead. mr. renshaw looked at his watch. i shall miss my train. but i think i have covered the ground quite thoroughly. there is just one thing. if this should happen while i am away just write her a letter quite a pleasant letter you understand pointing out the necessity of being in good time. let them turn off the steam heat and where are we sighed smith. well that is all i think. now i really must be going. goodby mr. he had not been working long when pugsy maloney the office boy entered. said pugsy. smith removed his feet from the table. it was with regret therefore rather than with the usual calm triumph of the office boy that he informed her that the editor was not in. he said. he will not be back for another three months. perhaps i can help you. i am acting editor. for the first time since she had entered the office betty was rather glad that mr. renshaw was away. but this long solemn youth put her at her ease. smith looked at her with interest. betty laughed. yet here i am. what that is at present i do not exactly know. betty hesitated. yes perhaps it would be better. you will get to like comrade maloney. and now to touch on a painful subject work. you would prefer to start in now excellent. you will find one or two letters on that table. betty sat down and began to think. she felt a little bewildered. she had imagined something so different. interesting and exciting things new york things began to happen at once. the cat was struggling violently but he appeared quite unconscious of it. said pugsy. betty was fond of cats. she cried anxiously. cried betty. shes probably starving. heres a quarter. he said. she attacked her task cautiously. his eyes were small and set close together. not in short the sort of man you would have picked out on sight as a model citizen. his face lighted up as he saw the cat. asked betty. this was on the ground floor. long island city knew him. said betty. mr. jarvis nodded with his eyes on the floor. there was a pause. he said and paused again. he said. any time youre in bad glad to be of service. bat jarvis. he had hardly gone when the door opened again and smith came in. he said. an old childhoods friend smith looked interested. betty related the story of the cat. smith nodded thoughtfully. still you never know what might happen. he might come in useful. it will suffer no divided attention. to betty everything was new and strange. when she was alone at night and had leisure to think the dream became a reality once more but in her hours of work or what passed for work in the office of peaceful moments and in the hours she spent walking about the streets and observing the ways of this new world of hers it faded. everything was so bright and busy every moment had its fresh interest. and above all there was the sense of adventure. betty liked smith. his conversation opened up a new world to betty. she began to see that in america and especially in new york anything may happen to anybody. she looked on smith with new eyes. suggested smith. smith sighed. before there had always been the quiet entertainment of watching the editor at work but now he was feeling restless. there was nothing for the man in charge to do. a visitor who called at the office at this time did nothing to remove this sensation of being outside everything that made life worth living. he was strangely silent. betty laughed. you saw the man i was talking to that was kid brady. i used to know him when i was out west. out west nobody could touch him. no i am glad. money it isnt right its a skin game. smith shook his head. i see my position too clearly. think of it comrade brown for cats meat of this description. he said. how could it be otherwise he rose from his seat. i will no longer calmly accept this terrible position. while i am in charge i will give our public something worth reading. repeated smith firmly. i mean in the paper not in my face. she exclaimed. all he knew was some highly interesting fact about an egg. full steam ahead and see what happens. it is a far far better thing that i do than i have ever done so to speak. are you ready then once more when the letters were finished she made one more objection. and i think its hard on them too. have no pity for them. and so with the others. bettys soft heart was distinctly relieved by the information. i think you are right there. i think so. i think so. asked smith. he asked patiently. said pugsy. a faint smile appeared upon smiths face. ill go in and wait says he. he opened the door of the inner room for betty and followed her in. there were five men in the room. as smith entered every eye was turned upon him. this accomplished he looked up and started. he gazed round the room. he murmured. the words broke the spell. the others paused for the reply. smith shook his head. ah well never mind. is there anything i can do for you gentlemen said the little man proudly. we are both intimate friends of mr. renshaw to whom my wifes work has always given complete satisfaction. where is mr. the chorus burst forth. it seemed that that was what they all wanted to know. where was mr. renshaw smith nodded. thats the man we want to see. thats what i want to know. and thats what these gentlemen want to know. the circumstances as you will admit when you have heard all are peculiar. you have asked me where mr. renshaw is. he was to enjoy complete rest. who can say where he is now smith bowed. doubtless he would gladly consider your work if it fitted in with his ideas. we must distinguish between the unusual and the impossible. the thing comes on you as a surprise. no i think you are wise. a happy smile lighted up the editors face. the warm weather had begun and there was nothing much going on in new york. listen to this. here is comrade brady on the subject i looked around that house and i seen i hadnt a friend in it. that is what the public wants. he leaned back in his chair. thats the thing to put a paper on the map. the worst of it is that everything seems to have been done. her lot had always been cast in pleasant places and she had never before been brought into close touch with this side of life. smiths words gave her an idea. she asked. smith nodded. cried betty. surely you couldnt have a better subject for your series its wicked. people only want to be told about them to make them better. the public isnt interested in them. besides it wouldnt be any use. smith looked at her curiously. the cause was plainly one that lay near to her heart. her face was flushed and eager. said smith taking it. he has dressed himself in his best. i would not have it otherwise. it is the right spirit. show the guy in. said smith. smith nodded to her and she went out. i have no quarrel with comrade renshaw. but he did not lead public thought. he paused. mr. parker looked at the door. it was closed. he bent forward. mr. parker scratched the floor with the point of a gleaming shoe. he seemed to be searching for words. mr. parker came to the point. mr. parker leaned forward. im going to put my cards on the table and see if we cant fix something up. now see here. you arent in this business for your health eh youve got your living to make same as everybody else i guess. well this is how it stands. how much do you want to stop those articles thats straight. ive been frank with you and i want you to be frank with me. whats your figure and what is that sentence you give it up mr. parker rose. he said. mr. parker picked up his hat. ive given you your chance. those stories are going to be stopped. and if youve any sense in you at all youll stop them yourself before you get hurt. he called. betty came in. you have done the state some service. he wanted to buy us off. this lunch is on the office. peaceful moments is grateful to you. this is our busy day. cried betty falling back. he said. ive been wondering what on earth hes been doing with himself all this time. betty had disappeared. he said. for a moment he could not have said what had given him this impression. then it flashed upon him. said smith. cried smith. a young man once called at the office of a certain newspaper and asked for a job. such is your case my son. let us consider it settled. i happen to know that he is anxious to get rid of it. it has hit somebody already. shell be in soon and ill introduce you. youll like her. what is the subject smith read the letter with raised eyebrows. said john not interested. he was inclined to be absent during these days. but im sorry shes quit. said john. his left ear was firmly grasped between the strangers finger and thumb. it might have made all the difference. the world is full of us. smith was thoughtful as he returned to the inner room. said john. smith related the events leading up to mr. parkers visit and described what had happened on that occasion. said john. it was plain that he was hungry for work that would keep him from thought. given certain conditions anything may happen in new york. circumstances had placed him below the surface where only his wits could help him. whats going to happen anyway the rest of the gang would probably know nothing about it. from where they sat they could see the million twinkling lights of the city. he asked. it was. i wonder why. he said. thats all right then. he turned to smith. murmured smith. he said. nobody knows. but just as soon as he heard who it was he was being asked to lay for he turned it down cold. said none of his fellows was going to put a finger on anyone who had anything to do with your paper. said smith. what did she do and he said you were to know that he wasnt mixed up in it. well thats all. ill be pushing along. ive a date. for a few moments after he had gone smith and john sat smoking in silence. asked smith suddenly. from the pocket of this he produced a watch. nine excellent. asked john. he is the man. it was a good honest title. the audience did nothing of the sort. the whistling ceased. he walked to the other side of the ring and repeated the remark. roared the crowd. he was an unknown. mr. fisher sprang from his corner as if somebody had touched a spring. smith turned sadly to john. that long left shot out less sharply. i will tell you. no. smith shut the door. i read em. theyre to the good. and it is for that reason that we have ventured to call upon you. exclaimed the kid. we can look after ourselves out of the office but what we want is someone to help in case they try to rush us there. in brief a fighting editor. take what you need and put the rest if any back. he slipped into his coat and resumed. well if that happens see what i mean i shouldnt be able to come and sit with you. thats good enough for me. you appear to be ready. said john. smith sighed. i did not think to ask. said smith suddenly. a little knot of men was approaching from the left. in the darkness it was impossible to say how many of them were there. smith stepped forward the kid at his side. stooping swiftly the kid picked it up and handed it to smith. his fingers closed upon it. the kids rapid work on the present occasion created a good deal of confusion. it was not a long affair. there was but one thing to be done. the kid struck another. see what i mean what do you think i done fall down and take the count not on your life. says i. see what i mean i hadnt a notion of what had happened. the first sign he showed of returning intelligence was a sudden dash for safety up the road. like that. same with this guy. this aint him. asked smith. you seem to be able to understand what he says. but the kid was not the man to attack a fallen foe. the kid gave a sudden howl. there was dead silence. the circle of light was empty now. the noise grew filling the still air. from somewhere down the road sounded the ring of running feet. cried a voice. the rescue party was coming up at the gallop. asked a voice. i could do with another pair of trousers too but i will not press the trousers. said another. demanded the third warmly. cried the third. inquired the force. jack he said had shown signs for some time past of asking for it in the neck. they seemed to think it was too bad of jack. we will leave the matter then in your hands. probably the thing crept upon him slowly. his aunt let us say or his small brother. i am glad we have secured comrade bradys services. then with less haste she walked on to the park and sat down on a bench to think. she did not know that smith and he were friends and did not therefore suspect that the former and not herself might be the object of his visit. nor had any word reached her of what had happened at mervo after her departure. she had taken it for granted that things had continued as she had left them and the only possible explanation to her of johns presence in new york was that acting under orders from mr. scobell he had come to try and bring her back. it was cool and soothing in the park. the peace of the summer afternoon stole upon her. it did not take her long to make up her mind that the door of peaceful moments was closed to her. john not finding her might go away but he would return. her heart was heavy when she had formed the decision. she had been as happy at peaceful moments as it was possible for her to be now. a squirrel ran up and sat begging for a nut. betty laughed. and then it came to her suddenly that it was no trifle this same problem of food. the warm green park seemed to grow chill and gray. once again she must deal with lifes material side. by what other possible means could he have found it and yet it seemed strange. perhaps john had gone to her and the sight of him had won the old lady over to his side. it might be so. she must look elsewhere for help or trust entirely to herself. mr. jarvis had not forgotten betty. never before had anyone quite like her crossed his path and at that moment romance had come to him. but that was not entirely satisfactory. betty smiled at him a little anxiously. suppose he had forgotten all about it suppose he should be violent for a moment her heart sank. no man looks his best immediately on rising from bed and bat even at his best was not a hero of romance. he did not look like the fairy prince who was to save her in her trouble. hideous things happened to his face. mr. jarvis spoke. betty followed him into the shop. she picked it up and began to stroke it. he gasped. mr. jarvis looked disappointed. asked betty. her mind had flashed back to mr. parkers visit and her heart was beating quickly. you wont dream of doing anything to hurt mr. smith will you mr. said betty anxiously. betty breathed freely again. she returned to her own affairs satisfied that danger no longer threatened. just around de corner. betty waited while he put on his coat and they started out. there was a pause. dats right. smith was puzzled. there had always been bad blood between the table hill and the three points. that had been a month or so back. alas for the best intentions having done which he left hurriedly fearing the wrath of bat jarvis. he had become famous in a night. i do so again. but im not going to stand in your way. we shall miss you. smith shook his head. said smith. asked john. i wonder what has become of her. i wish i knew where she was. you have never met comrade jarvis i believe it is i fancy the cat note which we shall have to strike today. he looked up as they entered and then resumed his task. thats straight aint it mr. jarviss expression changed. he really wished to know. but what of that the subject is too deep to be gone fully into at the moment. mr. jarvis looked astonished. sure its fierce when its like dat. sure. how sad it is in this world we look to every side. we look to north east south and west and what do we see i fancy you have heard a little about our troubles before this. mr. jarvis frowned. said smith. i may mention that there is money attached to the job. mr. jarvis reflected but a brief moment. nothing could be better. we will see you tomorrow then. till tomorrow then comrade jarvis. in reality yes. your manner was exactly right. i could see that you made a pronounced hit with comrade jarvis. there is no knowing what thirst for information a nights rest may not give comrade jarvis. he did not get up with them. he was supposed to be at the office at nine oclock. the kid had come to pay a farewell visit. asked the kid. as he spoke john appeared. i guess hell be here soon. a small boy was standing at the door holding a note. he said. master maloney had no such delicacy. said the kid. he was however cheerful. john looked at him concerned. smith nodded. this seemed reasonable. i said i would put on some clothes and come along. they said they couldnt wait about while i put on clothes. these men i told myself have lived longer in new york than i. they know what is done and what is not done. he sighed again. not now of course. this has finished the thing. cried john. you only came in to help me and i am no more. wheres the sense of getting yourself beaten up then john shook his head. give you three minutes more. he retired. smith looked at john. he said. smith smiled. they flock to you. i suppose i did more profound thinking last night than ive ever done in my life. well heres the idea. act on it or not as you please. said smith. he knows theyll drop him and go on to something else on the third and he knows hes broken no law. no theres something more in this business than that. dont you worry. john said goodby to smith and went out. he walked thoughtfully back to the office. said john. take a seat. you wont mind my not talking for the moment he rose and went into the outer office. i didnt know youd got a girl pugsy. it had occurred to john that the less time pugsy spent in the outer office during the next few days the better. their probable first move in such an event would be to knock master maloney on the head to prevent his giving warning of their approach. events proved that he had not been mistaken. the next moment three figures tumbled into the room. the third checked himself by holding the handle. the others were strangers. there was a pause. mr. jarvis spoke. the man to whom the question was directly addressed appeared to have some difficulty in finding a reply. his two companions seemed equally at a loss. he said. see dat goes. does dat go pugsy maloneys report on the following morning was entirely satisfactory. an say he has it pretty fierce dat kid. you start at the end then go back to any part which happens to appeal to you at the moment and eventually wind up at the beginning. he was out when john and pugsy arrived. the floor was covered with little heaps of linen. all the women were sewing. none of the women looked up at the noise. he said. well well do it in the paper if we cant in any other way. a small boy had appeared. he seemed surprised to see visitors. dont give in pugsy. master maloney made a gesture of disgust. john reflected. i wish whoever built it had thought to put in a few windows. john stood beneath it looking up. he turned in surprise. he said. the scene looked good to him. there was a set expression on johns face which suggested great things. john placing a firm hand on his collar led him to the top of the stairs and pushed him down. he now turned to john. john nodded. said john. nothing to do with me. he demanded. thats what id like to know. what do you want with the name of the owner of this place ive nothing for you. he became more friendly. i wish i could give you a story but i cant. say though thats a queer thing that paper. a friend of mine used to buy it regular. it gets past me. all i know is that its begun to get this place talked about. why you see for yourself how it is. here is your editor sending you down to get a story about it. i tell you straight they are and i know. i happen to be wise to a thing or two about whats going on on the other side and i tell you theres going to be something doing if they dont cut it out quick. hes going to get busy. then it hit him. he spun round. he pulled out a bill. as much as that john thanked him. playing a fool game like this i knew it before you told me. we cant afford to wait. no answering cry came from below. now then i cant wait much longer. said john. for the first time since john had known him pugsy was openly excited. john had made a movement as if to follow but the full meaning of pugsys words came upon him and he stopped. he said. john stood thinking. his mind was working rapidly. suddenly he smiled. i shall be all right there. if they find me they can only get at me one at a time. the light of intelligence began to shine in master maloneys face. off you go pugsy my son and dont take a week about it. pugsy vanished and john going to the ladder climbed out on to the roof with his big stick. he looked about him. and even then he would have cover in the shape of the chimney. but except for that his position could hardly have been stronger. as yet there was no sound of the enemys approach. for there a bare yard away stood betty. it was absurd he told himself that he should be feeling as if he had known of her presence there all the time. yet it was so. joy at the sight of her he felt keen and almost painful but no surprise. betty started violently. the enemy had reached the top floor. he threw back his head and shouted. he thrust his head down through the trap to see what was going on. suddenly there was an excited shout then a rush of feet. voices called to each other in the passage below. the voices ceased abruptly. the new arrival was a young man with a shock of red hair a broken nose and a mouth from which force or the passage of time had removed three front teeth. he held on to the edge of the trap and stared up at john. he cried. the strong light of the open air was trying to his eyes. get on top de roof. the suggestion made a hit. there was no doubt about that. it was a success from the start. john waited with some interest for the reply but it did not come. a report like a cannon sounded in the passage below. john grasped his stick more firmly. this was evidently the real attack. now for our interesting experiment. keep quite still. now. what are you coming up the roof of the house next door began to fill up. john was the popular favorite. their attitude toward john was that of a group of men watching a dog at a rat hole. roared one. john sighed. a voice from the passage called to john. said john. i like being up here. there was silence below. the time began to pass slowly. john smiled comfortably. certain voices urged going down to help the main body. leave dat stiff on de roof. john rose. he got up and stretched himself. then she turned to john her eyes wide with anxiety. she cried. johns heart leaped at the anxious break in her voice. cried betty starting. its all right. he said lightly. there was silence now in the street. she drew her hands from the childrens grasp and covered her face. as she lowered them again john saw that the blood had left her cheeks. she was white and shaking. her hands dropped slowly to her side. he looked at her with glowing eyes not understanding but content that the journey was ended that she was there in his arms speaking to him. betty was pink but composed. he said as he saw betty more closely. john turned in surprise. betty looked at him puzzled. thats how i happen to be here now. i come down every day and help look after the babies. poor little souls there seems to be nobody else here who has time to do it. its dreadful. he asked. i didnt see no sam. i guess dat was him. dats right. john turned to betty. betty shook her head with a smile. i havent stolen anything yet and i think mr. jarvis is a little disappointed in me. he has been very good to me. you must quit. said betty. she spoke lightly but her face was serious. i couldnt bear it. he hesitated. her manner changed again. pugsy im coming back to the paper. she lowered herself through the trap and john handed the children down to her. john drew a deep breath. betty looked at him across the table with shining eyes. it was good to be together again. he was aware of a small hand creeping round the table under cover of the cloth. i dont know what i expected to do. i suppose i thought i might find you by chance. ill tell you about it later. and it has occupied my mind quite some. you certainly have started something betty goodness knows where it will end. yes why were you there it was smiths idea. and im pretty certain he was right. bettys forehead was wrinkled. and quick tell me some more about him. quick cried john. they looked at each other in silence. it is. he must be. its as mr. smith said. the private reason. its as clear as daylight. naturally he would do anything rather than be found out. dont you see well she would be one if if she could bear to part with money. yes i know it sounds ridiculous. but its so. its true. the smile passed away from johns face. he said. he said at last. bettys back was towards them but john saw them and stared. asked betty. but betty had twisted round in her chair. he leaned back in his chair. he said. betty had whipped round again. her face was white with excitement. do you see who that is with him john drew in his breath sharply. john laughed quietly. asked betty. the fruit of that name. asked betty again. he said. parkers his name. john walked through. ive a cab waiting outside. that little surprise packet of yours last night put him down and out. gave him a stroke of some sort. john thought for a moment. he had no reason to be fond of mr. scobell but he was sorry that this should have happened. they went out on the street. they got in. neither spoke. mr. parker too appeared to be absorbed in his own thoughts. he sat with folded arms and lowered head. he cried. john dropped his hand. mr. parker leaned back with the pistol resting easily on his knee. the cab began to move more quickly. he blushed for himself. john bit his lip. he said at last. mr. parker did not reply. said john again. there would be no escape. no nothing could happen till they reached open country. it was from this quarter that he appeared to expect attack. a faint hope occurred to john that by talking he might put the other off his guard for just that instant which was all he asked. said john. he said. i seem to see them tearing you limb from limb. off comes an arm. that is what would happen mr. asked john. mr. parker did not reply. the cab moved swiftly on. now they had reached the open country. he was bound to be hit somewhere. that was certain. presently the body of the machine was raised slightly as he got to work with the jack. he leaned back. and at the moment somebody spoke in the road outside. john recognized it. it was the voice of kid brady. say itll cost him something too. it was his last chance. would the kid think to look inside the cab or would he move on could he risk a shout outside the conversation had begun again and the kid had made his decision. john met mr. parkers eye and smiled. it was the chance john had prayed for. john had risen from his seat as he delivered the blow and it got the full benefit of his weight. john pushed him on to the seat as he slid toward the floor. the interested face of the kid appeared at the window. the kid stared amazed. ill explain later. asked the kid. show me the nearest station kid. i must be getting back to new york. ill tell you all about it as we go. a walk will do me good. she had been informed by pugsy that he had gone out in the company of mr. parker and she felt uneasy. he said. the atmosphere was indeed one of peace. the cats settled themselves comfortably one on each of mr. jarvis knees. but the peace did not last. the door burst open and a little man dashed in. behind him was a crowd of uncertain numbers. they were all strangers to john. he said. the cats fell to the floor. the rest of the party had entered. asked john. mr. renshaw caught the name. mr. smith. i want to see mr. smith. john nodded. mr. renshaw gasped. asked the editor. asked john. john waved his hands. i ought to have introduced you. this is mr. renshaw our editor. said john. john held up his hand. he picked up the current number of peaceful moments and turned to the kids page. he gives me another nasty look. exclaimed mr. renshaw. you know a good thing when you see one. let me see where is it ah i have it. its this way. then bring down the heel of your left hand. there isnt a guy living that could stand up against that. no no it really isnt so. he was extremely agitated let me tell you. mr. renshaw stared. repeated mr. renshaw. there was a moments absolute silence. cried mr. renshaw. mr. renshaw in particular was disturbed. if he were to be removed from peaceful moments he would find it hard to place himself anywhere else. pugsy maloney entered bearing a card. he turned to mr. renshaw. because if so i should be glad if you would start in with the next number. at least i hope to be in a few minutes. said mr. jarvis. when mr. renshaw and the others had followed them john rang the bell for pugsy. he started at the sight of betty but he was evidently too absorbed in the business in hand to be surprised at seeing her. he said. said john. he asked. said john. everything i touch turns to mud. what do you know about that sure thing. the old lady wont stand for it. he turned to betty. that was enough for me. she wouldnt stand for it for a moment. i guess i didnt treat you good prince but lets forget it. ease up on this rough stuff. betty spoke. i left parker in charge. it was up to him to do what was wanted. say prince i want to talk to you about that guy parker. i understand hes been rather rough with you and your crowd. that wasnt my doing. i didnt know anything about it till he told me. he used to do those sort of things out there and hes forgotten his manners. i pay him well and i guess he thinks thats the way its up to him to earn it. said john. sure. that goes. he rose. john took bettys hand. mr. scobell bit through his cigar in his emotion. he gave a little sigh of content. he had pointed out that john was not doing what fate expected of him. a door opened behind him. they sat there without speaking. i wish all our absent friends could be with us tonight. or perhaps not quite all. i also saw comrade brady before i left. peaceful moments however i am sorry to say is silent on the subject. it was not like this in the good old days. how is the paper going now john smith stretched himself. he closed his eyes. the cigar dropped from his fingers. there was a long silence. there was no answer. betty drew her chair closer. her hand stole out and found his. i have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. i had seen little of holmes lately. my marriage had drifted us away from each other. to me who knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their own story. he was at work again. i rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own. it seldom was but he was glad i think to see me. just a trifle more i fancy watson. and in practice again i observe. you would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago. you have not observed. and yet you have seen. that is just my point. this account of you we have from all quarters received. but the note itself. and the man who wrote the note is a german. holmes whistled. stay where you are. and this promises to be interesting. i may want your help and so may he. here he comes. a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height with the chest and limbs of a hercules. that is very bad i was young. she is herself the very soul of delicacy. and she will do it. i know that she will do it. you do not know her but she has a soul of steel. at three oclock precisely i was at baker street but holmes had not yet returned. i sat down beside the fire however with the intention of awaiting him however long he might be. putting his hands into his pockets he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes. i will tell you however. be one of them and you will know all that there is to know. he was a lawyer. what was the relation between them and what the object of his repeated visits was she his client his friend or his mistress if the latter it was less likely. of her i could see nothing. it hadnt pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. i only caught a glimpse of her at the moment but she was a lovely woman with a face that a man might die for. the driver looked twice at such a shabby fare but i jumped in before he could object. i dont think i ever drove faster but the others were there before us. i paid the man and hurried into the church. they were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. youll do. come at the church door however they separated he driving back to the temple and she to her own house. i shall drive out in the park at five as usual she said as she left him. i heard no more. it is nearly five now. in two hours we must be on the scene of action. there is only one point on which i must insist. do not join in it. your task is confined to that. when you raise your cry of fire it will be taken up by quite a number of people. there is that double possibility. but i am inclined to think neither. why should she hand it over to anyone else besides remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. it must be where she can lay her hands upon it. it is her carriage. holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground with the blood running freely down his face. they were a gang and a rough one too. there is a comfortable sofa. a maid rushed across and threw open the window. she was bound to have me in. what else could she do it lay between that and her bedroom and i was determined to see which. now it was clear to me that our lady of today had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. she would rush to secure it. she was there in an instant and i caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. i shall call with the king tomorrow and with you if you care to come with us. she will not be up so that we shall have a clear field. if the lady loves her husband she does not love your majesty. well i wish she had been of my own station my mistress told me that you were likely to call. you took     me in completely. until after the alarm of fire i had not a     suspicion. but then when i found how i had betrayed myself i     began to think. i had been warned against you months ago. and your address had been given me. i often take advantage of the     freedom which it gives. i sent john the coachman to watch you     ran upstairs got into my walking clothes as i call them and came     down just as you departed. i love and am loved by a better man than he. pray tell me in what way i can reward you. then there is no more to be done in the matter. ii. as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to. your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. this is what began it all. its not a very large affair and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. its hard to say his age. in that way i didnt know much of what was going on outside and i was always glad of a bit of news. this american had started from london when he was young and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. there is water in your eyes said he as he released me. i perceive that all is as it should be. i am sorry to hear you say that. the will is very clear upon that point. there is the first volume of it in that press. he started me off upon the letter a and then he left me but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. it was the same next week and the same the week after. every morning i was there at ten and every afternoon i left at two. and no later than this morning. but there is if you will excuse my saying so something just a little funny about it. i did not know what to do. he said that he had never heard of any such body. he answered that the name was new to him. he did tell me the address. but he could not help me in any way. he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post. but that was not quite good enough mr. holmes. i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. i am going through the city first and we can have some lunch on the way. that carries us right on to the other block. and now doctor weve done our work so its time we had some play. i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. where were we going and what were we to do hes a remarkable man is young john clay. his brain is as cunning as his fingers and though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to find the man himself. ive had one or two little turns also with mr. john clay and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. it is past ten however and quite time that we started. i thought it as well to have jones with us also. within there was a small corridor which ended in a very massive iron gate. then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. but i see that the enemys preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. then when i flash a light upon them close in swiftly. the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready to flash out at a moments notice. from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor. you seem to have done the thing very completely. that however was out of the question. it must then be something out of the house. what could it be the cellar what could it be once more i surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. it was not in front. i hardly looked at his face. his knees were what i wished to see. you must yourself have remarked how worn wrinkled and stained they were. saturday would suit them better than any other day as it would give them two days for their escape. i already feel it closing in upon me. they are important you understand without being interesting. here we may take it that there is a love matter but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed or grieved. oh mr. holmes i wish you would do as much for me. i wasnt best pleased mr. holmes when she married again so soon after fathers death and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. of course that is only just for the time. he never did wish us to go anywhere. but this time i was set on going and i would go for what right had he to prevent he said the folk were not fit for us to know when all fathers friends were to be there. he wouldnt have any visitors if he could help it and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. we could write in the meantime and he used to write every day. we were engaged after the first walk that we took. even his voice was gentle. mother said he was quite right to make me swear and that it was a sign of his passion. then when they talked of marrying within the week i began to ask about father but they both said never to mind about father but just to tell him afterwards and mother said she would make it all right with him. i didnt quite like that mr. holmes. that was unfortunate. your wedding was arranged then for the friday. he was too good and kind to leave me so. as he said what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church and then leaving me and yet what could have happened and why could he not write let the weight of the matter rest upon me now and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. angels address you never had i understand. you have made your statement very clearly. you will leave the papers here and remember the advice which i have given you. she laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned. old as is the idea however there were one or two details which were new to me. you did not know where to look and so you missed all that was important. now what did you gather from that womans appearance her boots i didnt observe. you have really done very well indeed. it is true that you have missed everything of importance but you have hit upon the method and you have a quick eye for colour. my first glance is always at a womans sleeve. she had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. it must have been this morning or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. however i shall write two letters which should settle the matter. i thought of the salt that i have been working upon. there was never any mystery in the matter though as i said yesterday some of the details are of interest. i am afraid that i am a little late but i am not quite my own master you know. unless they are quite new no two of them write exactly alike. some letters get more worn than others and some wear only on one side. it is a subject to which i have devoted some little attention. thats right it was a considerable sum for people in their position and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. it was worth an effort to preserve it. but soon he found that that would not answer forever. then mr. angel began to call for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. if the young lady has a brother or a friend he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. i knew the firm for which this man worked. shall be glad if you will come with me. you have been looking a little pale lately. i will explain the state of things to you as far as i have been able to understand it in a very few words. that is as much as i have been able to gather about the families. now for the facts. to the best of his belief the father was actually in sight at the time and the son was following him. he was much excited without either his gun or his hat and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. on following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. i could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. i settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. shortly after my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard and looking out of my window i saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard though i was not aware in which direction he was going. i had no idea that he was in front of me. i then hurried forward and found him standing by the pool. yet i have a vague impression that as i ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. when i rose from my father i looked round for it but it was gone. no wind and not a cloud in the sky. why bless my soul i have driven down to tell you so. i know that james didnt do it. i know it and i want you to start upon your work knowing it too. never let yourself doubt upon that point. you have formed some conclusion oh i know that he is right. james never did it. poor father has never been strong for years back but this has broken him down completely. no doubt you will go to the prison to see james. it was something terrible and deadly. what could it be i marked the spot upon my own head. clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. still it did not go for very much for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. still it might be worth while to call holmes attention to it. what could that mean no it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. it was late before sherlock holmes returned. mark that point. it is of importance. who i would call your attention very particularly to two points. this business has had a very bad effect upon him. in a hundred other ways he has helped him. the daughter told us as much. we called at the door when the maid at holmes
request showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death and also a pair of the sons though not the pair which he had then had. sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. he ran round like a dog who is picking up a scent and then turned upon my companion. i thought there might be some weapon or other trace. i have no time that bears out his story. he ran when he saw his father on the ground. what is this then and this ha ha what have we here square too quite unusual boots it had only lain there a few days. there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. goodbye. i dont know quite what to do and i should value your advice. he was trying to utter the name of his murderer. he put less weight upon it. why the blow was struck from immediately behind and yet was upon the left side. he had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son. i see the direction in which all this points. my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a month. you will sign it and watson here can witness it. and now i will make the thing clear to you it has been a long time in the acting but will not take me long to tell. i tell you that. ill tell you first how i came to be in his power. we got away with the gold became wealthy men and made our way over to england without being suspected. i bought this estate which chanced to be in the market and i set myself to do a little good with my money to make up for the way in which i had earned it. i married too and though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice. even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. in a word i turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. theres two of us me and my son and you can have the keeping of us. it grew worse as alice grew up for he soon saw i was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. whatever he wanted he must have and whatever it was i gave him without question land money houses until at last he asked a thing which i could not give. he asked for alice. but there i was firm. i stood firm. it drove me mad to think that i and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. i was already a dying and a desperate man. but my memory and my girl i did it mr. holmes. i would do it again. his cry brought back his son but i had gained the cover of the wood though i was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which i had dropped in my flight. as evening drew in the storm grew higher and louder and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. who could come tonight nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour. he had a garden and two or three fields round his house and there he would take his exercise though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. he begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. i began to laugh at this but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. if you can enjoy it in peace well and good i could see a change in my uncle however. he drank more than ever and he was less inclined for any sort of society. we found the brass box there although its contents had been destroyed. so it is he cried. here are the very letters. i was glad that he should go for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. i hurried to him but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. nothing but energy can save you. we should have acted before this. i found this single sheet upon the floor of his room and i am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has perhaps fluttered out from among the others and in that way has escaped destruction. it must be done at once. you must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described. you must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that this is the only one which remains. the streets will be crowded so i trust that you may be in safety. sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. save perhaps that. thank you. and now let us consider another point. it is probable. i think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. it may well have been cause and effect. sherlock holmes was already at breakfast when i came down. the bridge no doubt was too crowded even on such a night for their purpose. well watson we shall see who will win in the long run. sherlock holmes had not come back yet. it was nearly ten oclock before he entered looking pale and worn. it had escaped my memory. i know also that they were all three away from the ship last night. how you startled me kate now you must have some wine and water and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. i want the doctors advice and help too. he has not been home for two days. did she know where her husband was was it possible that we could bring him back to her it seems that it was. but what was she to do there was the case and of course there was but one way out of it. might i not escort her to this place and then as a second thought why should she come at all i could manage it better if i were alone. i promised her on my word that i would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. your wife has been waiting this two days for you. but ill go home with you. give me your hand but i must owe something. find what i owe watson. i am all off colour. i glanced down. i took two steps forward and looked back. youll know all about it presently. jump up here. all right john we shall not need you. heres half a crown. look out for me tomorrow about eleven. give her her head. theres plenty of thread no doubt but i cant get the end of it into my hand. there was no sign of him there. the bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. his appearance you see is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. it was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. but a human body is a different matter. what would he do then there is not an instant to be lost. see that light among the trees i hate to meet her watson when i have no news of her husband. here we are. but come in. i had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. this man has written the name and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. let us now see the letter. ha all will come well. hum ha i know that all is well with him. there is so keen a sympathy between us that i should know if evil came upon him. those are the principal points about which i wished to be absolutely clear. as i dressed i glanced at my watch. it was no wonder that no one was stirring. it was twentyfive minutes past four. i had hardly finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse. we both sprang in and away we dashed down the london road. one of them held the horses head while the other led us in. that is easily done. come this way. the prisoner lay with his face towards us in a very deep sleep breathing slowly and heavily. a shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead. he my god there was the point from which all my adventures started. in ten days i had the money and had paid the debt. only one man knew my secret. my dear wife knew that i had business in the city. she little knew what. but if you are found again then all must come out. its owner is unknown. and first as to how it came here. the goose we retained until this morning when there were signs that in spite of the slight frost it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. it was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape hard and much the worse for wear. you fail however to reason from what you see. it came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. it is a hat of the very best quality. what of it then sherlock holmes sat up with a whistle. a precious stone. he had remained with horner some little time but had finally been called away. thank you. every good stone is. this stone is not yet twenty years old. i dine at seven. just as i arrived the door was opened and we were shown up together to holmes room. ah watson you have just come at the right time. yes i see. i know some of them. i dont know him. let us follow it out to the bitter end. dyou see now then you see this other page in red ink now look at that third name. there you are. ive had enough of it. who are you i will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. now then i dont wonder that you should take an interest in it. give him an arm back into his chair watson. so now he looks a little more human. still that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. what did you do then of my mother it would break their hearts. i never went wrong before i never will again. i swear it. ill swear it on a bible. oh dont bring it into court i will leave the country sir. we will talk about that. and now let us hear a true account of the next act. how came the stone into the goose and how came the goose into the open market there was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. one day he had met me and fell into talk about the ways of thieves and how they could get rid of what they stole. he would show me how to turn the stone into money. but how to get to him in safety i might at any moment be seized and searched and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. as i turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others. its the big white one over yonder. ill have the other and ill take it now said i. he laughed until he choked and we got a knife and opened the goose. my heart turned to water for there was no sign of the stone and i knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. i left the bird rushed back to my sisters and hurried into the back yard. there was not a bird to be seen there. you heard him yourselves tonight. well he has always answered me like that. my sister thinks that i am going mad. sometimes i think that i am myself. god help me then my friend rose and threw open the door. this fellow will not go wrong again he is too terribly frightened. besides it is the season of forgiveness. ha the marks are perfectly fresh. it was from her that i had your address. i think it was before your time watson. no servant would stay with us and for a long time we did all the work of the house. you can understand that living the life which i have described we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. at eleven oclock she rose to leave me but she paused at the door and looked back. it was a wild night. i knew that it was my sisters voice. i sprang from my bed wrapped a shawl round me and rushed into the corridor. i ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. it was the band that is important. it is certain therefore that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. a month ago however a dear friend whom i have known for many years has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. i sprang up and lit the lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room. yet we have not a moment to lose. it is probable that he will be away all day and that there would be nothing to disturb you. i have myself some small business matters to attend to. i have heard of you before. my companion sat in the front of the trap his arms folded his hat pulled down over his eyes and his chin sunk upon his breast buried in the deepest thought. it may stop his gossip. you must lock yourself up from him tonight. now on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall. this is very interesting. ah me its a wicked world and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. let me explain. two hours passed slowly away and then suddenly just at the stroke of eleven a single bright light shone out right in front of us. then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear. have your pistol ready in case we should need it. by it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. then he turned down the lamp and we were left in darkness. how long they seemed those quarters i heard a gentle sound of movement and then all was silent once more though the smell grew stronger. it struck cold to our hearts and i stood gazing at holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose. twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. it was a singular sight which met our eyes. as we entered he made neither sound nor motion. i took a step forward. he has died within ten seconds of being bitten. the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day. then i thought of the whistle. of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. having once made up my mind you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof. there he is all safe and sound. he laughed very heartily with a high ringing note leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. it was useless however. we shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him. every day from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon i waited in my little den until at last my heart began to sink and i came to believe that i should never have any practice at all. i do not think that i have ever seen so thin a man. but you will find that all i say is really to the point. the passage outside was empty. if you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. i suppose there would be no chance of a train back. naturally it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value but unfortunately i had no capital by which i could do this. this press as i have already explained has got out of order and we wish your advice upon the subject. without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage the door of which was standing open. i am sorry to have interrupted you. suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage and a long golden bar of light shot out in our direction. it was a quiet little plainly furnished room with a round table in the centre on which several german books were scattered. i shall not keep you waiting an instant said he and vanished into the darkness. it was a wonderfully silent house. and where was the place yet it was quite certain from the absolute stillness that we were in the country. i could see at a glance that she was sick with fear and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. she held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent and she shot a few whispered words of broken english at me her eyes glancing back like those of a frightened horse into the gloom behind her. i should not stay here. was it all to go for nothing with a stout bearing therefore though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess i still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where i was. by the way i was under the impression that i left this door shut just now. perhaps we had better proceed to business then said he. mr. but never mind that. within was a small square room in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. this was clearly the cause of the loss of power and i pointed it out to my companions who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. when i had made it clear to them i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. colonel he had set the engine at work. i threw myself screaming against the door and dragged with my nails at the lock. then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which i met it. for an instant i could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. they will be here in a moment. they will see that you are not there. the latter led to another broad passage and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices one answering the other from the floor on which  we were and from the one beneath. my guide stopped and looked about her like one  who is at her wits end. then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom through the window of which the moon was shining brightly. i rushed across the bedroom flung open the window and looked out. the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door pushing his way past her but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back. you said it should not be again. he will be silent you will be the ruin of us. he has seen too much. let me pass i say
he dashed her to one side and rushing to the window cut at me with his heavy weapon. it must have been a very long time for the moon had sunk and a bright morning was breaking when i came to myself. but to my astonishment when i came to look round me neither house nor garden were to be seen. were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream. there would be one to reading in less than an hour. the name was strange to him. had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me no he had not. there was one about three miles off. i determined to wait until i got back to town before telling my story to the police. it was a little past six when i arrived so i went first to have my wound dressed and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. ha the place we want must be somewhere near that line. i will read it to you and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. it is three now. the duke his father was at one time secretary for foreign affairs. ha but there is a ring at the bell watson and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four i have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. i have been cut to the quick. i had no idea. very right very right im sure i beg pardon. he had nothing a few years ago. holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. that is very interesting. i hardly noticed his appearance. she was very independent in little matters like that. i have given you all the facts. come at once. youre mad it is most important all the same. ha the lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him but he still refused to raise his eyes. it would only have made him mad to know so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. we cant command our love but we can our actions. i went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. i thought it was his ghost at first but when i looked again there he was still with a kind of question in his eyes as if to ask me whether i were glad or sorry to see him. i wonder i didnt drop. i didnt know what to do. should i stop the service and make a scene in the church i glanced at him again and he seemed to know what i was thinking for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. it was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. i just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. i hadnt been at the table ten minutes before i saw frank out of the window at the other side of the road. i slipped out put on my things and followed him. it is likely that we should have gone on to paris tomorrow only that this good gentleman mr. holmes came round to us this evening though how he found us is more than i can think and he showed us very clearly and kindly that i was wrong and that frank was right and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. what could that something be she could not have spoken to anyone when she was out for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. had she seen someone then then who could this american be and why should he possess so much influence over her it might be a lover it might be a husband. there are not many in london which charge at that rate. ha then he passed his handkerchief over his brow set his lips tight and turned his face towards us. besides it is not i alone. that is why i was so out of breath for i am a man who takes very little exercise. i feel better now and i will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as i can. you may set your mind at rest about that. it is a pure matter of form. i already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. if so how terrible would be the position in which i should find myself i determined therefore that for the next few days i would always carry the case backward and forward with me so that it might never be really out of my reach. she came with an excellent character however and has always given me satisfaction. my family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. i have no doubt that i am myself to blame. people tell me that i have spoiled him. very likely i have. when my dear wife died i felt that he was all i had to love. she is my niece but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world i adopted her and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. she is my right hand. i do not know what i could do without her. in only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. i think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she and that his marriage might have changed his whole life but now alas he followed me to my room however that night with a very grave face. i could not bear the disgrace. as i came down the stairs i saw mary herself at the side window of the hall which she closed and fastened as i approached. about two in the morning then i was awakened by some sound in the house. it had ceased ere i was wide awake but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. i lay listening with all my ears. suddenly to my horror there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. you thief at my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. i snatched it up and examined it. you have destroyed it there cannot be any missing said he. and you know where they are. i shall not say another word about this business since you have chosen to insult me. i was determined that the law should have its way in everything. there was but one way for it. the police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. you may go to any expense which you think necessary. mary and i stay at home. besides she is not so very young. you are doing what you can for him and for me. but it is too heavy a task. what was he doing there at all his silence appears to me to cut both ways. there are several singular points about the case. we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. oh do do take my word for it that he is innocent. let the matter drop and say no more. he wished us to leave him alone. ah this i suppose is he. we must come back to that. an ordinary man could not do it. there would be a noise like a pistol shot. i shall look into the matter between this and then. it was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. it may be some time before i get back. nothing to complain of. it is a very sweet little problem and i would not have missed it for a good deal. i waited until midnight but there was no sign of his return so i retired to my room. one sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. her bed this morning had not been slept in her room was empty and a note for me lay upon the hall table. i had said to her last night in sorrow and not in anger that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. i cannot with this thought in my mind ever     again be happy under your roof and i feel that i must leave you     forever. you say so you have heard something mr. holmes you have learned something three thousand will cover the matter. and there is a little reward i fancy. here is a pen. when i had cleared it all up i had an interview with him and finding that he would not tell me the story i told it to him on which he had to confess that i was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. your niece knew nothing of such men. your niece when you had as she thought gone to your room slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. he rushed down just as he was in his bare feet opened the window sprang out into the snow and ran down the lane where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. what a blind fool i have been and his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes the dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. i was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. i followed them up and found they led to the hall window where boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. then i walked to the other end which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. i saw where boots had faced round where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle and finally where a few drops of blood had fallen to show me that i was not mistaken. i was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. so far i was clear. now i knew that it was not you who had brought it down so there only remained your niece and the maids. but if it were the maids why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place there could be no possible reason. i had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. it was i. i found that i had my man so i came home and changed my clothes. i went and saw him. i knew my man however and i clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. then he became a little more reasonable. that brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. as to what you tell me of poor mary it goes to my very heart. crime is common. i think that i have touched bottom at last however. at last the little money which i had saved began to run short and i was at my wits end as to what i should do. capital this is all quite beside the question. in dress now for example. it is a pity because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. besides what use was my hair to me many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps i should be among the number. next day i was inclined to think that i had made a mistake and by the day after i was sure of it. my wife is very anxious that you should     come for she has been much attracted by my description of you. your duties as far as the child is concerned are     very light. let me know your train. i cannot tell. that is what makes me uneasy. i assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. i am at my wits end. but holmes shook his head gravely. you look at these scattered houses and you are impressed by their beauty. but look at these lonely houses each in its own fields filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. it is the five miles of country which makes the danger. but which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. it is only fair to them to say that. but you shall have it all just as it occurred. as the daughter could not have been less than twenty i can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her fathers young wife. and yet she had some secret sorrow this woman. more than once i have surprised her in tears. the one unpleasant thing about the house which struck me at once was the appearance and conduct of the servants. there are only two a man and his wife. they are a most unpleasant couple but fortunately i spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room which are next to each other in one corner of the building. they were waiting for me in the drawingroom which is a very large room stretching along the entire front of the house with three long windows reaching down to the floor. i read for about ten minutes beginning in the heart of a chapter and then suddenly in the middle of a sentence he ordered me to cease and to change my dress. i confess that i was disappointed. there was nothing. at least that was my first impression. she rose at once. it walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. there was only one thing in it but i am sure that you would never guess what it was. was it not extraordinary he locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look. they were evidently all deserted. i have made my dark room up there. but dear me who would have believed it i read suspicion there and annoyance but no jest. it was not mere curiosity though i have my share of that. i have no doubt at all that he had left it there. i turned the key gently in the lock opened the door and slipped through. round this corner were three doors in a line the first and third of which were open. the door itself was locked as well and the key was not there. do you see he was still smiling in the most amiable manner. i suppose that i must have rushed past him into my room. i remember nothing until i found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. then i thought of you mr. holmes. i could not live there longer without some advice. i was frightened of the house of the man of the woman of the servants even of the child. they were all horrible to me. if i could only bring you down all would be well. of course i might have fled from the house but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. my mind was soon made up. i put on my hat and cloak went down to the office which is about half a mile from the house and then returned feeling very much easier. i slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. we shall then look thoroughly into the affair. that is obvious. so much is fairly clear. we can do nothing until seven oclock. then he tried the various keys in the lock but without success. together we rushed into the room. it was empty. i tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. i have caught you have i you are in my power. its not been fed for two days. he knew he was safe with her but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward who would ask for all that the law would give him then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. he wanted her to sign a paper so that whether she married or not he could use her money. they soon know that they will grow up and the way wendy knew was this. one day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. you always know after you are two. two is the beginning of the end. he never knew about the box and in time he gave up trying for the kiss. wendy came first then john then michael. did i say nine nine seven mrs. darling loved to have everything just so and mr. darling had a passion for being exactly like his neighbours so of course they had a nurse. she proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. they sat on forms while nana lay on the floor but that was the only difference. he had his position in the city to consider. nana also troubled him in another way. he had sometimes a feeling that she did not admire him. if you could keep awake but of course you cant you would see your own mother doing this and you would find it very interesting to watch her. i dont know whether you have ever seen a map of a persons mind. there were odd stories about him as that when children died he went part of the way with them so that they should not be frightened. for instance they may remember to mention a week after the event happened that when they were in the wood they had met their dead father and had a game with him. unfortunately she never woke so she didnt know how she knew she just knew. she was in a hurry to get her breakfast. oh surely she must have been dreaming. but on the other hand there were the leaves. mrs. darling examined them very carefully they were skeleton leaves but she was sure they did not come from any tree that grew in england. certainly wendy had been dreaming. but wendy had not been dreaming as the very next night showed the night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be said to have begun. on the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed. she was asleep. look at the four of them wendy and michael over there john here and mrs. darling by the fire. while she slept she had a dream. he did not alarm her for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have no children. perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also. the dream by itself would have been a trifle but while she was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open and a boy did drop on the floor. she started up with a cry and saw the boy and somehow she knew at once that he was peter pan. if you or i or wendy had been there we should have seen that he was very like mrs. darlings kiss. she growled and sprang at the boy who leapt lightly through the window. again mrs. darling screamed this time in distress for him for she thought he was killed and she ran down into the street to look for his little body but it was not there and she looked up and in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was a shooting star. she returned to the nursery and found nana with something in her mouth which proved to be the boys shadow. you may be sure mrs. darling examined the shadow carefully but it was quite the ordinary kind. nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow. ah me of course it was a friday. i george darling did it. nana it isnt six oclock yet. oh dear oh dear i shant love you any more nana. wendy had danced with joy just as the real mrs. darling must have done. michael had nearly cried. such a little thing for mr. and mrs.
darling and nana to recall now but not so little if that was to be michaels last night in the nursery. perhaps there was some excuse for him. he too had been dressing for the party and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie. this was such an occasion. oh dear no of course mrs. darling brushed him but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse. wendy was quite puzzled. in a horrid silence mrs. darling smelt the bowl. oh dear no he felt he was a strong man again. he was ashamed of himself and yet he did it. no. they were already the only persons in the street and all the stars were watching them. stars are beautiful but they may not take an active part in anything they must just look on for ever. it is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was. it was not really a light it made this light by flashing about so quickly but when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy no longer than your hand but still growing. it is the fairy language. you ordinary children can never hear it but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before. tink said that the shadow was in the big box. a shudder passed through peter and he sat on the floor and cried. she was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor she was only pleasantly interested. she was much pleased and bowed beautifully to him from the bed. she asked where he lived. for the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny address. not only had he no mother but he had not the slightest desire to have one. how exactly like a boy fortunately she knew at once what to do. he thought he had attached the shadow himself. but for the moment wendy was shocked. it was lucky that she did put it on that chain for it was afterwards to save her life. wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as quite delightful. still he liked them on the whole and he told her about the beginning of fairies. he had his first laugh still. this seemed to wendy rather forward for a first meeting and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house. it is to listen to the stories. he came back and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to have alarmed her but did not. it was quite as if she were trying to remain on the nursery floor. but he had no pity for her. of course he was on the floor already. all was as still as salt. then everything was right. no stop everything was wrong. it was her silence they had heard. hide every one of the little angels sound asleep in bed. why that was just what she wanted. we now return to the nursery. he was quite a practical boy. he did not quite mean to let go but he did it and immediately he was borne across the room. up and down they went and round and round. heavenly was wendys word. but wendy hesitated. not three figures four in a tremble they opened the street door. she even tried to make her heart go softly. will they reach the nursery in time if so how delightful for them and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief but there will be no story. on the other hand if they are not in time i solemnly promise that it will all come right in the end. they would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the little stars were watching them. mr. and mrs. darling and nana rushed into the nursery too late. the birds were flown. peter you see just said anything that came into his head. they recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room. not long ago. but how long ago they were flying over the sea before this thought began to disturb wendy seriously. john thought it was their second sea and their third night. sometimes it was dark and sometimes light and now they were very cold and again too warm. did they really feel hungry at times or were they merely pretending because peter had such a jolly new way of feeding them but wendy noticed with gentle concern that peter did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter nor even that there are other ways. certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy they were sleepy and that was a danger for the moment they popped off down they fell. the awful thing was that peter thought this funny. he could sleep in the air without falling by merely lying on his back and floating but this was partly at least because he was so light that if you got behind him and blew he went faster. they could not follow him in this with much success so perhaps it was rather like showing off especially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed. john said that if the worst came to the worst all they had to do was to go straight on for the world was round and so in time they must come back to their own window. peter was not with them for the moment and they felt rather lonely up there by themselves. he could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot out of sight to have some adventure in which they had no share. wendy was sure of it. he was very sorry. it is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores. it came as the arrows went leaving the island in gloom. but he could not or would not say. having done these things he went on again. i would wake him first and then kill him. he asked if there were many pirates on the island just now and peter said he had never known so many. that is about the only thing fairies cant do. he had a happy idea. johns hat tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. john carried it though she had hoped to be carried by peter. even these noises ceased. to michael the loneliness was dreadful. the pirates had fired long tom at them. when at last the heavens were steady again john and michael found themselves alone in the darkness. we know now that no one had been hit. peter however had been carried by the wind of the shot far out to sea while wendy was blown upwards with no companion but tinker bell. it would have been well for wendy if at that moment she had dropped the hat. tink was not all bad or rather she was all bad just now but on the other hand sometimes she was all good. fairies have to be one thing or the other because being so small they unfortunately have room for one feeling only at a time. they are however allowed to change only it must be a complete change. she did not yet know that tink hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman. in his absence things are usually quiet on the island. on this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows. they were going round and round the island but they did not meet because all were going at the same rate. the first to pass is tootles not the least brave but the most unfortunate of all that gallant band. poor kind tootles there is danger in the air for you tonight. as dogs this terrible man treated and addressed them and as dogs they obeyed him. let us now kill a pirate to show hooks method. which will win bringing up the rear the place of greatest danger comes tiger lily proudly erect a princess in her own right. observe how they pass over fallen twigs without making the slightest noise. the only sound to be heard is their somewhat heavy breathing. their tongues are hanging out they are hungry tonight. when they have passed comes the last figure of all a gigantic crocodile. we shall see for whom she is looking presently. then quickly they will be on top of each other. this shows how real the island was. the first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. it was only in peters absence that they could speak of mothers the subject being forbidden by him as silly. they are no longer there. rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly. i will tell you where they are. but how have they reached it look closely however and you may note that there are here seven large trees each with a hole in its hollow trunk as large as a boy. will he find it tonight now for the first time we hear the voice of hook. it was a black voice. for instance after killing it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon. he spoke long and earnestly but what it was all about smee who was rather stupid did not know in the least. then again he frowned. the pirates looked at each other. they had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground. not only smoke came out of it. hook nodded. smee had been waiting for it. there can be but one room below for there is but one chimney. that shows they have no mother. it was indeed the crocodile. the next moment is the long one but victory came quickly for as the boys advanced upon them in the terrible attitude the wolves dropped their tails and fled. but it was not wolves he saw. but more distinct came the shrill voice of tinker bell. the others did not hear her. they had crowded round wendy and as they looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood. if wendys heart had been beating they would all have heard it. slightly was the first to speak. they all whipped off their caps. tootles face was very white but there was a dignity about him now that had never been there before. they heard peter crow. again came that ringing crow and peter dropped in front of them. he frowned. they would all have been glad to follow if he had done this. but there was the arrow. he took it from her heart and faced his band. you remember she had put it on a chain that she wore round her neck. it is the kiss i gave her. but what to do with wendy in her present delicate state of health as they dragged along the ground they fell asleep standing stopped woke up moved another step and slept again. of course he meant to leave room for chairs and a table. john and michael watched him. but he knew peter must be obeyed and he returned in a moment wearing johns hat and looking solemn. but roses  babies nothing escaped his eagle eyes. absolutely finished now they thought. not of bit of it. this gave peter an idea. he snatched the hat off johns head knocked out the bottom top and put the hat on the roof. the little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that as if to say thank you smoke immediately began to come out of the hat. now really and truly it was finished. nothing remained to do but to knock. what the boys were wondering was would any one answer the knock if a lady what would she be like the door opened and a lady came out. it was wendy. they all whipped off their hats. she looked properly surprised and this was just how they had hoped she would look. of course slightly was the first to get his word in. come inside at once you naughty children i am sure your feet are damp. wendy and michael fitted their trees at the first try but john had to be altered a little. it was rough and simple and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an underground house in the same circumstances. you remember about her pet wolf. well it very soon discovered that she had come to the island and it found her out and they just ran into each others arms. after that it followed her about everywhere. as time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had left behind her he was above all that sort of thing. what was the colour of mothers eyes and so on. wendy you see had been forgetting too. he often went out alone and when he came back you were never absolutely certain whether he had had an adventure or not. he might have forgotten it so completely that he said nothing about it and then when you went out you found the body and on the other hand he might say a great deal about it and yet you could not find the body. but she was never quite sure you know. there were however many adventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself and there were still more that were at least partly true for the other boys were in them and said they were wholly true. the difficulty is which one to choose. which of these adventures shall we choose it was not she knew that night had come but something as dark as night had come. no worse than that. it had not come but it had sent that shiver through the sea to say that it was coming. what was it she stood over them to let them have their sleep out. was it not brave of wendy peter sprang erect as wide awake at once as a dog and with one warning cry he roused the others. he stood motionless one hand to his ear. the others came closer to him. a strange smile was playing about his face and wendy saw it and shuddered. while that smile was on his face no one dared address him all they could do was to stand ready to obey. the boat drew nearer. no watch was kept on the ship it being hooks boast that the wind of his name guarded the ship for a mile around. now her fate would help to guard it also. an easy way would have been to wait until the pirates had gone but he was never one to choose the easy way. now wendy understood. the real hook was also in the water. he was swimming to the boat and as his men showed a light to guide him he had soon reached them. the two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their captain to them but he sat with his head on his hook in a position of profound melancholy. wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed. what a lesson the nest must have fallen into the water but would the mother desert her eggs they thought it must have been a leaf in the wind. by this time they were on the rock and suddenly hook remembered tiger lily. he saw his men draw back from him. against such fearful evidence it was not their belief in him that he needed it was his own. smee reflected. in the confusion some struck at their own side. where all this time was peter he was seeking bigger game. but there was one who did not fear him there was one prepared to enter that circle. strangely it was not in the water that they met. neither knew that the other was coming. each feeling for a grip met the others arm in surprise they raised their heads their faces were almost touching so they met. had it been so with peter at that moment i would admit it. quick as thought he snatched a knife from hooks belt and was about to drive it home when he saw that he was higher up the rock than his foe. it would not have been fighting fair. he gave the pirate a hand to help him up. it was then that hook bit him. it made him quite helpless. he often met it but he always forgot it. i suppose that was the real difference between him and all the rest. so when he met it now it was like the first time and he could just stare helpless. they were not very anxious because they had such faith in peter. with a last effort peter pulled her up the rock and then lay down beside her. he knew that they would soon be drowned but he could do no more. as they lay side by side a mermaid caught wendy by the feet and began pulling her softly into the water. peter feeling her slip from him woke with a start and was just in time to draw her back. but he had to tell her the truth. hook wounded me. they thought they would soon be no more. it had torn itself out of his hand and floated away. peter was not quite like other boys but he was afraid at last. next moment he was standing erect on the rock again with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him. it was not really a piece of paper it was the never bird making desperate efforts to reach peter on the nest. by working her wings in a way she had learned since the nest fell into the water she was able to some extent to guide her strange craft but by the time peter recognised her she was very exhausted. she had come to save him to give him her nest though there were eggs in it. i rather wonder at the bird for though he had been nice to her he had also sometimes tormented her. i can suppose only that like mrs. darling and the rest of them she was melted because he had all his first teeth. she called out to him what she had come for and he called out to her what she was doing there but of course neither of them understood the others language. well not only could they not understand each other but they forgot their manners. then peter tried slow and distinct. then at last he understood and clutched the nest and waved his thanks to the bird as she fluttered overhead. it was not to receive his thanks however that she hung there in the sky it was not even to watch him get into the nest it was to see what he did with her eggs. there were two large white eggs and peter lifted them up and reflected. the bird covered her face with her wings so as not to see the last of them but she could not help peeping between the feathers. it floated beautifully. every boy had adventures to tell but perhaps the biggest adventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed. the way you got the time on the island was to find the crocodile and then stay near him till the clock struck. this was telling and slightly seized his chance. john however had held up his hand first. tootles held up his hand. he was already in his basket. then at last he stopped. it had become a very familiar scene this in the home under the ground but we are looking on it for the last time. there was a step above and wendy you may be sure was the first to recognize it. as so often before but never again. he had brought nuts for the boys as well as the correct time for wendy. it was not really saturday night at least it may have been for they had long lost count of the days but always if they wanted to do anything special they said this was saturday night and then they did it. he had a sudden idea. but she had been much tried and she little knew what was to happen before the night was out. if she had known she would not have snapped. none of them knew. perhaps it was best not to know. their ignorance gave them one more glad hour and as it was to be their last hour on the island let us rejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it. usually when she began to tell this story he left the room or put his hands over his ears and possibly if he had done either of those things this time they might all still be on the island. but tonight he remained on his stool and we shall see what happened. can they be john and michael everything just as it should be you see. still it is best to be careful and no one knows so quickly as a child when he should give in. they knew in what they called their hearts that one can get on quite well without a mother and that it is only the mothers who think you cant. if she did not mind the parting he was going to show her was peter that neither did he. then peter returned and they saw at once that they would get no support from him. how dare you then she pretended to be asleep again. they took it for granted that if they went he would go also but really they scarcely cared. on this occasion however she did not give peter his draught portion for just as she had prepared it she saw a look on his face that made her heart sink. now if peter had ever quite had a mother he no longer missed her. he could do very well without one. he had thought them out and remembered only their bad points. their first thought was that if peter was not going he had probably changed his mind about letting them go. but he was far too proud for that. below there was dead silence. mouths opened and remained open. wendy fell on her knees but her arms were extended toward peter. it is written that the noble savage must never express surprise in the presence of the white. there is no beating about the bush for we know quite well what it was and have got to tell. the question now was how to get down the trees or how to get his dogs down in the meantime what of the boys which side had won never probably had this simple man admired hook so much. this puzzled the pirates but all their other feelings were swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the trees. rapidly and silently hook gave his orders one man to each tree and the others to arrange themselves in a line two yards apart. the more quickly this horror is disposed of the better. she was only a little girl. hook saw it and it did peter a bad service. there was no way of knowing save by going down. then silently he let himself go into the unknown. as his eyes became accustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees took shape but the only one on which his greedy gaze rested long sought for and found at last was the great bed. on the bed lay peter fast asleep. sometimes though not often he had dreams and they were more painful than the dreams of other boys. he stood silent at the foot of the tree looking across the chamber at his enemy. feeling for the catch he found to his fury that it was low down beyond his reach. was his enemy to escape him after all but what was that five drops of this he now added to peters cup. as he emerged at the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole. peter slept on. then he spoke. wendy bound and on the pirate ship she who loved everything to be just so as he leapt he thought of something he could do to please her. he could take his medicine. his hand closed on the fatal draught. nevertheless hooks words had left no room for doubt. his head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt near her in distress. she liked his tears so much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it. her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said. then he made it out. she was saying that she thought she could get well again if children believed in fairies. peter flung out his arms. some didnt. it was not such a night as he would have chosen. he regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange names that they are very wild and difficult of approach. but in what direction for he could not be sure that the children had been taken to the ship slightly if he had an opportunity would blaze cut a mark in the trees for instance curly would drop seeds and wendy would leave her handkerchief at some important place. the upper world had called him but would give no help. of this as of almost everything else smee was quite unconscious. hook trod the deck in thought. it was his hour of triumph. it was because he was so terribly alone. hook was not his true name. but above all he retained the passion for good form. good form ah envy not hook. hook felt a gloomy desire to make his dying speech lest presently there should be no time for it. feared him feared smee he had said horrid things to them and hit them with the palm of his hand because he could not hit with his fist but they had only clung to him the more. michael had tried on his spectacles. with a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over smees head but he did not tear. for a time he seemed unconscious of their presence.  and he was struck by hooks picking him out. bring up their mother. but they tried to look brave when wendy was brought up. but as the boys gathered round her she had no thought of course save for them. with a hasty gesture he tried to hide it but he was too late. it was smee who tied her to the mast. it is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as smee tied her to the mast the eyes of all were on the plank that last little walk they were about to take. hook smiled on them with his teeth closed and took a step toward wendy. his intention was to turn her face so that she should see the boys walking the plank one by one. he heard something else instead. they all heard it pirates boys wendy and immediately every head was blown in one direction not to the water whence the sound proceeded but toward hook. very frightful was it to see the change that came over him. he fell in a little heap. they had no thought of fighting it. it was fate. it was peter. now such an experience had come that night to peter. thus many animals pass from land to water but no other human of whom i know. the crocodile at first he thought the sound did come from the crocodile and he looked behind him swiftly. now reader time what happened by your watch. peter struck true and deep. he fell forward. there was a splash and then silence. how long has it taken they could hear each others distressed breathing now which showed them that the more terrible sound had passed. there was not a sound and he drew himself up firmly to his full height. peter was in the cabin the children gazed at each other. no one spoke except slightly. open the cabin door and drive them in. the boys pretending to struggle were pushed into the cabin and the door was closed on them. but not one dared to face the door. yes one wendy who all this time had been bound to the mast. she had not long to wait. in that frightful moment i think his fierce heart broke. i think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded hook who seemed to have a charmed life as he kept them at bay in that circle of fire. they had done for his dogs but this man alone seemed to be a match for them all. the others drew back and formed a ring around them. and again and again he darted in and pricked. hook was fighting now without hope. what sort of form was hook himself showing for we have come to his last moment. thus perished james hook. hook had feared. he had one of his dreams that night and cried in his sleep for a long time and wendy held him tightly. it need not be said who was the captain. there was a woman aboard. hook. it seems a shame to have neglected no. we are no more than servants. it would be the moral lesson they have been in need of ever since we met them but if we contrived things in this way mrs.
darling would never forgive us. this would spoil so completely the surprise to which wendy and john and michael are looking forward. she does not really need to be told to have things ready for they are ready. for all the use we are to her we might well go back to the ship. however as we are here we may as well stay and look on. nobody really wants us. look at her in her chair where she has fallen asleep. the corner of her mouth where one looks first is almost withered up. some like peter best and some like wendy best but i like her best. they are really within two miles of the window now and flying strong but all we need whisper is that they are on the way. lets. it is a pity we did it for she has started up calling their names and there is no one in the room but nana. oh no. we have written it so because that was the charming arrangement planned by them before we left the ship but something must have happened since then for it is not they who have flown in it is peter and tinker bell. peters first words tell all. thats right. this trick had been in his head all the time. she is a pretty lady but not so pretty as my mother. he was angry with her now for not seeing why she could not have wendy. he ceased to look at her but even then she would not let go of him. thus wendy and john and michael found the window open for them after all which of course was more than they deserved. but john whistled. the children waited for her cry of joy but it did not come. she saw them but she did not believe they were there. you see she saw them in their beds so often in her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her still. they could not understand this and a cold fear fell upon all the three of them. he knew her now. yes they did they went round wendy and john and michael who had slipped out of bed and run to her. they were waiting below to give wendy time to explain about them and when they had counted five hundred they went up. they stood in a row in front of mrs. darling with their hats off and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes. they said nothing but their eyes asked her to have them. they ought to have looked at mr. darling also but they forgot about him. then he burst into tears and the truth came out. as for peter he saw wendy once again before he flew away. he did not exactly come to the window but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him. that is what she did. he took mrs. darlings kiss with him. the kiss that had been for no one else peter took quite easily. funny. but she seemed satisfied. it is sad to have to say that the power to fly gradually left them. in time they could not even fly after their hats. want of practice they called it but what it really meant was that they no longer believed. next year he did not come for her. she waited in a new frock because the old one simply would not meet but he never came. that was the last time the girl wendy ever saw him. but the years came and went without bringing the careless boy and when they met again wendy was a married woman and peter was no more to her than a little dust in the box in which she had kept her toys. wendy was grown up. you need not be sorry for her. she was one of the kind that likes to grow up. all the boys were grown up and done for by this time so it is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them. slightly married a lady of title and so he became a lord. you see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door that used to be tootles. years rolled on again and wendy had a daughter. this ought not to be written in ink but in a golden splash. when she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about peter pan. she loved to hear of peter and wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place. mrs. darling was now dead and forgotten. she died of old age and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself. once a week janes nurse had her evening off and then it was wendys part to put jane to bed. that was the time for stories. she was as grown up as that. wendy was a little startled. it was the spring of the year and the story had been told for the night and jane was now asleep in her bed. then the window blew open as of old and peter dropped in on the floor. he was exactly the same as ever and wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth. he was a little boy and she was grown up. peter looked. then she turned up the light and peter saw. he gave a cry of pain and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply. she had to tell him. i am ever so much more than twenty. of course he did not strike. he sat down on the floor instead and sobbed and wendy did not know how to comfort him though she could have done it so easily once. she was only a woman now and she ran out of the room to try to think. she sat up in bed and was interested at once. wendy rushed to the window. of course in the end wendy let them fly away together. as you look at wendy you may see her hair becoming white and her figure little again for all this happened long ago. it was true too. she had a little thin face and a little thin body thin light hair and a sour expression. her hair was yellow and her face was yellow because she had been born in india and had always been ill in one way or another. her father had held a position under the english government and had always been busy and ill himself and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people. so if mary had not chosen to really want to know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all. there was something mysterious in the air that morning. pig she was with a fair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices. mary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy. she had heard that he was a very young officer who had just come from england. the child stared at him but she stared most at her mother. before the next day three other servants were dead and others had run away in terror. nobody thought of her nobody wanted her and strange things happened of which she knew nothing. it was sweet and she did not know how strong it was. the wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyes open and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more for a long time. when she awakened she lay and stared at the wall. the house was perfectly still. she had never known it to be so silent before. mary had been rather tired of the old ones. she did not cry because her nurse had died. she was not an affectionate child and had never cared much for anyone. but if everyone had got well again surely someone would remember and come to look for her. but no one came and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow more and more silent. she was not frightened because he was a harmless little thing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get out of the room. he slipped under the door as she watched him. no one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed to open doors and look into rooms. i suppose the child too. the first man who came in was a large officer she had once seen talking to her father. he looked tired and troubled but when he saw her he was so startled that he almost jumped back. a child alone in a place like this that was why the place was so quiet. chapter ii 
 mistress mary quite contrary 
mary had liked to look at her mother from a distance and she had thought her very pretty but as she knew very little of her she could scarcely have been expected to love her or to miss her very much when she was gone. if she had been older she would no doubt have been very anxious at being left alone in the world but she was very young and as she had always been taken care of she supposed she always would be. she did not want to stay. presently he got rather interested and suddenly made a suggestion. he danced round and round her and made faces and sang and laughed. you have none. you are going to your uncle. girls never do. i heard father and mother talking about him. he lives in a great big desolate old house in the country and no one goes near him. hes so cross he wont let them and they wouldnt come if he would let them. she was a stout woman with very red cheeks and sharp black eyes. mary did not like her at all but as she very seldom liked people there was nothing remarkable in that besides which it was very evident mrs. medlock did not think much of her. what sort of a place was it and what would he be like she had never seen one. perhaps there were none in india. she had begun to wonder why she had never seemed to belong to anyone even when her father and mother had been alive. she had had servants and food and clothes but no one had taken any notice of her. she did not know that this was because she was a disagreeable child but then of course she did not know she was disagreeable. she often thought that other people were but she did not know that she was so herself. she thought mrs. medlock the most disagreeable person she had ever seen with her common highly colored face and her common fine bonnet. it would have made her angry to think people imagined she was her little girl. but mrs. medlock was not in the least disturbed by her and her thoughts. she never dared even to ask a question. the child is to be brought here. she frowned because she remembered that her father and mother had never talked to her about anything in particular. certainly they had never told her things. she did not say any more for a few moments and then she began again. the house is six hundred years old and its on the edge of the moor and theres near a hundred rooms in it though most of thems shut up and locked. mary had begun to listen in spite of herself. it all sounded so unlike india and anything new rather attracted her. but she did not intend to look as if she were interested. that was one of her unhappy disagreeable ways. so she sat still. hes not going to trouble himself about you thats sure and certain. this was one way of passing some of the time at any rate. nobody thought shed marry him but she did and people said she married him for his money. he cares about nobody. he wont see people. a man with a crooked back who shut himself up also youll have to play about and look after yourself. youll be told what rooms you can go into and what rooms youre to keep out of. theres gardens enough. the guard lighted the lamps in the carriage and mrs. medlock cheered up very much over her tea and chicken and beef. it was quite dark when she awakened again. the train had stopped at a station and mrs. medlock was shaking her. the little girl did not offer to help her because in india native servants always picked up or carried things and it seemed quite proper that other people should wait on one. the station was a small one and nobody but themselves seemed to be getting out of the train. she sat and looked out of the window curious to see something of the road over which she was being driven to the queer place mrs. medlock had spoken of. she could see nothing in fact but a dense darkness on either side. a wind was rising and making a singular wild low rushing sound. the road went up and down and several times the carriage passed over a little bridge beneath which water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise. mrs. medlock saw it as soon as she did and drew a long sigh of relief. at first mary thought that there were no lights at all in the windows but as she got out of the carriage she saw that one room in a corner upstairs showed a dull glow. as she stood on the stone floor she looked a very small odd little black figure and she felt as small and lost and odd as she looked. mary lay and watched her for a few moments and then began to look about the room. she had never seen a room at all like it and thought it curious and gloomy. there were hunters and horses and dogs and ladies. mary felt as if she were in the forest with them. its none bare. eh the native servants she had been used to in india were not in the least like this. indian servants were commanded to do things not asked. im too common an i talk too much yorkshire. but this is a funny house for all its so grand. seems like theres neither master nor mistress except mr. pitcher an mrs. medlock. mrs. medlock gave me th place out o kindness. martha sat up on her heels again and stared. she spoke in broad yorkshire in her amazement. tha cannot begin younger. she could scarcely stand this. but martha was not at all crushed. you thought i was a native. thats not th way for a young lady to talk. you always read as a blacks a man an a brother. ive never seen a black an i was fair pleased to think i was goin to see one close. you dared you know nothing about india. she went to the bed and bent over her. i didnt know youd be vexed. i beg your pardon miss. she gradually ceased crying and became quiet. martha looked relieved. medlock said i was to carry tha breakfast an tea an dinner into th room next to this. its been made into a nursery for thee. ill help thee on with thy clothes if thall get out o bed. craven ordered mrs. medlock to get em in london. put color on her. mother she said she knew what he meant. mother always knows what a body means. i can tell you my mothers put to it to get porridge for em all. when she went into the room which had been made into a nursery for her she found that it was rather like the one she had slept in. but she had always had a very small appetite and she looked with something more than indifference at the first plate martha set before her. my word i get my day out once a month same as th rest. there was nothing to do. when mrs. medlock had prepared the nursery she had not thought of amusement. perhaps it would be better to go and see what the gardens were like. martha stared. our dickon goes off on th moor by himself an plays for hours. thats how he made friends with th pony. hes got sheep on th moor that knows him an birds as comes an eats out of his hand. they would be different from the birds in india and it might amuse her to look at them. martha found her coat and hat for her and a pair of stout little boots and she showed her her way downstairs. here was another locked door added to the hundred in the strange house. craven had it shut when his wife died so sudden. he wont let no one go inside. it was her garden. he locked th door an dug a hole and buried th key. she could not help thinking about the garden which no one had been into for ten years. she wondered what it would look like and whether there were any flowers still alive in it. this was not the garden which was shut up. how could a garden be shut up you could always walk into a garden. this was not the closed garden evidently and she could go into it. the place was bare and ugly enough mary thought as she stood and stared about her. presently an old man with a spade over his shoulder walked through the door leading from the second garden. he looked startled when he saw mary and then touched his cap. she went down the path and through the second green door. perhaps it led into the garden which no one had seen for ten years. as she was not at all a timid child and always did what she wanted to do mary went to the green door and turned the handle. she listened to him until he flew away. he was not like an indian bird and she liked him and wondered if she should ever see him again. perhaps he lived in the mysterious garden and knew all about it. perhaps it was because she had nothing whatever to do that she thought so much of the deserted garden. she was curious about it and wanted to see what it was like. if he had liked his wife so much why did he hate her garden she wondered if she should ever see him but she knew that if she did she should not like him and he would not like her and that she should only stand and stare at him and say nothing though she should be wanting dreadfully to ask him why he had done such a queer thing. she went and stood beside him and watched him a few moments in her cold little way. he took no notice of her and so at last she spoke to him. a slow smile spread over it and the gardener looked quite different. she had not thought of it before. almost the next moment a wonderful thing happened. he seemed quite familiar and not the least afraid. it actually gave mary a queer feeling in her heart because he was so pretty and cheerful and seemed so like a person. he had a tiny plump body and a delicate beak and slender delicate legs. he come out of th nest in th other garden an when first he flew over th wall he was too weak to fly back for a few days an we got friendly. it really seemed as if he were finding out all about her. the queer feeling in her heart increased. the old ones turn em out o their nest an make em fly an theyre scattered before you know it. she had not known before that this was one of the things which made her feel sour and cross. she seemed to find it out when the robin looked at her and she looked at the robin. mary nodded. he began to dig again driving his spade deep into the rich black garden soil while the robin hopped about very busily employed. he stood up to answer her. she was almost as curious about dickon as she was about the deserted garden. but just that moment the robin who had ended his song gave a little shake of his wings spread them and flew away. he had made his visit and had other things to do. here i must go on with my work. get you gone an play you. she ran only to make herself warm and she hated the wind which rushed at her face and roared and held her back as if it were some giant she could not see. there was nothing else to do. once when she was walking toward him he picked up his spade and turned away as if he did it on purpose. it was the long walk outside the gardens with the walls round them. it seemed as if for a long time that part had been neglected. a few days after she had talked to ben weatherstaff mary stopped to notice this and wondered why it was so. he did answer. it seemed to mistress mary as if she understood him too though he was not speaking in words. isnt the wind nice isnt the sun nice isnt everything nice come on that reminded mary of the first time she had seen him. he lives in there. she felt as if she rather liked to hear her and at last she thought she would ask her a question. she sat down on the hearth herself without waiting to be asked. martha tucked her feet under her and made herself quite comfortable. but one knew he could not get in and somehow it made one feel very safe and warm inside a room with a red coal fire. she intended to know if martha did. then martha gave up her store of knowledge. medlock said its not to be talked about. theres lots o things in this place thats not to be talked over. thats mr. cravens orders. his troubles are none servants business he says. but for th garden he wouldnt be like he is. an
she was just a bit of a girl an there was an old tree with a branch bent like a seat on it. an she made roses grow over it an she used to sit there. th
doctors thought hed go out o his mind an die too. at that moment a very good thing was happening to her. but as she was listening to the wind she began to listen to something else. she did not know what it was because at first she could scarcely distinguish it from the wind itself. sometimes the wind sounded rather like a child crying but presently mistress mary felt quite sure this sound was inside the house not outside it. it was far away but it was inside. she turned round and looked at martha. martha suddenly looked confused. she did not believe she was speaking the truth. there could be no going out today. there does seem a lot of us then. dickon he doesnt mind th wet. he once found a little fox cub half drowned in its hole and he brought it home in th bosom of his shirt to keep it warm. hes got it at home now. she had even begun to find it interesting and to be sorry when she stopped or went away. mary was most attracted by the mother and dickon. she made up her mind to go and find it herself. she was not troubled about mrs. medlock. in this queer place one scarcely ever saw anyone at all. mrs. medlock came and looked at her every day or two but no one inquired what she did or told her what to do. she had often been tired of her company. now she was followed by nobody and was learning to dress herself because martha looked as though she thought she was silly and stupid when she wanted to have things handed to her and put on. she stood at the window for about ten minutes this morning after martha had swept up the hearth for the last time and gone downstairs. she was thinking over the new idea which had come to her when she heard of the library. she did not care very much about the library itself because she had read very few books but to hear of it brought back to her mind the hundred rooms with closed doors. she wondered if they were all really locked and what she would find if she could get into any of them. were there a hundred really it would be something to do on this morning when she could not go out. she had never been taught to ask permission to do things and she knew nothing at all about authority so she would not have thought it necessary to ask mrs. medlock if she might walk about the house even if she had seen her. there were doors and doors and there were pictures on the walls. she had never thought there could be so many in any house. she walked slowly down this place and stared at the faces which also seemed to stare at her. she felt as if they were wondering what a little girl from india was doing in their house. she always stopped to look at the children and wonder what their names were and where they had gone and why they wore such odd clothes. there was a stiff plain little girl rather like herself. her eyes had a sharp curious look. since so many rooms had been built people must have lived in them but it all seemed so empty that she could not quite believe it true. it was not until she climbed to the second floor that she thought of turning the handle of a door. all the doors were shut as mrs. medlock had said they were but at last she put her hand on the handle of one of them and turned it. she was almost frightened for a moment when she felt that it turned without difficulty and that when she pushed upon the door itself it slowly and heavily opened. it was a massive door and opened into a big bedroom. she saw so many rooms that she became quite tired and began to think that there must be a hundred though she had not counted them. some were much bigger than the others and some were so tiny that they seemed only babies. mary had seen carved ivory in india and she knew all about elephants. in the corner of the sofa there was a cushion and in the velvet which covered it there was a hole and out of the hole peeped a tiny head with a pair of frightened eyes in it. mary crept softly across the room to look. the bright eyes belonged to a little gray mouse and the mouse had eaten a hole into the cushion and made a comfortable nest there. if there was no one else alive in the hundred rooms there were seven mice who did not look lonely at all. she had wandered about long enough to feel too tired to wander any farther and she turned back. youre one that needs someone to look sharp after you. she did not cry but ground her teeth. she had found out a great deal this morning. she felt as if she had been on a long journey and at any rate she had had something to amuse her all the time and she had played with the ivory elephants and had seen the gray mouse and its babies in their nest in the velvet cushion. never never had mary dreamed of a sky so blue. it does like this at this time o th year. martha laughed as she had done the first morning. i told thee thad like th moor after a bit. it was so new and big and wonderful and such a heavenly color. tha couldnt walk five mile. she was thinking that the small plain face did not look quite as sour at this moment as it had done the first morning she saw it. its my day out today an im goin
home. eh i am glad. mrs. medlock thinks a lot o mother. she sat up on her heels again and rubbed the end of her nose with the back of her hand as if puzzled for a moment but she ended quite positively. mary hesitated a moment and thought it over. she went out into the garden as quickly as possible and the first thing she did was to run round and round the fountain flower garden ten times. she counted the times carefully and when she had finished she felt in better spirits. the sunshine made the whole place look different. the change in the weather seemed to have done him good. he spoke to her of his own accord. very soon she heard the soft rustling flight of wings again and she knew at once that the robin had come again. she had been born ten years ago. she walked away slowly thinking. she had begun to like the garden just as she had begun to like the robin and dickon and marthas mother. she was beginning to like martha too. she thought of the robin as one of the people. but she knew he had followed her and the surprise so filled her with delight that she almost trembled a little. it was as if he were talking. mistress mary forgot that she had ever been contrary in her life when he allowed her to draw closer and closer to him and bend down and talk and try to make something like robin sounds. oh to think that he should actually let her come as near to him as that she was so happy that she scarcely dared to breathe. the earth had been turned up because a dog had been trying to dig up a mole and he had scratched quite a deep hole. it was more than a ring however it was an old key which looked as if it had been buried a long time. mistress mary stood up and looked at it with an almost frightened face as it hung from her finger. she turned it over and over and thought about it. it was because it had been shut up so long that she wanted to see it. it seemed as if it must be different from other places and that something strange must have happened to it during ten years. besides that if she liked it she could go into it every day and shut the door behind her and she could make up some play of her own and play it quite alone because nobody would ever know where she was but would think the door was still locked and the key buried in the earth. the thought of that pleased her very much. there is no doubt that the fresh strong pure air from the moor had a great deal to do with it. just as it had given her an appetite and fighting with the wind had stirred her blood so the same things had stirred her mind. she put the key in her pocket and walked up and down her walk. she was very much disappointed. it seemed so silly she said to herself to be near it and not be able to get in. she took the key in her pocket when she went back to the house and she made up her mind that she would always carry it with her when she went out so that if she ever should find the hidden door she would be ready. i didnt walk all th way. would tha really do that miss how could a cottage full of fourteen hungry people give anyone a present no wonder most of ems black. but martha did not even see them. thats what mother said. she was not very clever at it but she liked it so much that she did not want to stop. she opened the door to go out and then suddenly thought of something and turned back rather slowly. martha gave her hand a clumsy little shake as if she was not accustomed to this sort of thing either. then she laughed. but tha isnt. she had wondered if he would notice her. hell be at it again today. hes never seen one. she did not mind much because she had already counted up to thirty. she put her hands under the leaves and began to pull and push them aside. what was this under her hands which was square and made of iron and which her fingers found a hole in she put the key in and turned it. it took two hands to do it but it did turn. and then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk to see if anyone was coming. no one was coming. then she slipped through it and shut it behind her and stood with her back against it looking about her and breathing quite fast with excitement and wonder and delight. she was standing inside the secret garden. mary had thought it must be different from other gardens which had not been left all by themselves so long and indeed it was different from any other place she had ever seen in her life. she was glad that there was grass under her feet and that her steps made no sounds. everything was strange and silent and she seemed to be hundreds of miles away from anyone but somehow she did not feel lonely at all. she did not want it to be a quite dead garden. if it were a quite alive garden how wonderful it would be and what thousands of roses would grow on every side she remembered what ben weatherstaff had said and she knelt down to look at them. she liked it very much. she went slowly and kept her eyes on the ground. ill do all i can see. the exercise made her so warm that she first threw her coat off and then her hat and without knowing it she was smiling down on to the grass and the pale green points all the time. he had often wondered at ben weatherstaff. now here was this new kind of creature who was not half bens size and yet had had the sense to come into his garden and begin at once. she had such red cheeks and such bright eyes and ate such a dinner that martha was delighted. she had put it back in its place and patted the earth carefully down on it and just now she wondered if martha could tell her what it was. eh they are nice. theyre the prettiest sight in yorkshire when th spring comes. she must be careful if she meant to keep her secret kingdom. she really could not bear that. so many places seem shut up. there is no one to talk to here except you and ben weatherstaff. and you have to do your work and ben weatherstaff wont speak to me often. she gives me one every saturday. martha shook her head. i didnt know you were so nice. i know i can print letters if i try. then it was a serious piece of work to write to dickon. she could not spell particularly well but she found that she could print letters when she tried. pick the prettiest ones and easy to grow because she has never done it before and lived in india which is different. give my love to mother and everyone of you. to think of going over the moor in the daylight and when the sky was blue to think of going into the cottage which held twelve children the secret garden was what mary called it when she was thinking of it. she liked the name and she liked still more the feeling that when its beautiful old walls shut her in no one knew where she was. it seemed almost like being shut out of the world in some fairy place. sometimes people went to sleep in them for a hundred years which she had thought must be rather stupid. she was beginning to like to be out of doors she no longer hated the wind but enjoyed it. the sun could get at them and warm them and when the rain came down it could reach them at once so they began to feel very much alive. mary was an odd determined little person and now she had something interesting to be determined about she was very much absorbed indeed. she wondered how long it would be before they showed that they were flowers. sometimes she stopped digging to look at the garden and try to imagine what it would be like when it was covered with thousands of lovely things in bloom. during that week of sunshine she became more intimate with ben weatherstaff. she surprised him several times by seeming to start up beside him as if she sprang out of the earth. the truth was that she was afraid that he would pick up his tools and go away if he saw her coming so she always walked toward him as silently as possible. but in fact he did not object to her as strongly as he had at first. then also she was more civil than she had been. tha looked like a young plucked crow when tha first came into this garden. he seemed determined to make ben weatherstaff admire him. i know what thas up to. he flew right up to the handle of ben weatherstaffs spade and alighted on the top of it. then the old mans face wrinkled itself slowly into a new expression. he spoke quite in a whisper. then he stood looking at the handle of the spade as if there might be magic in it and then he began to dig again and said nothing for several minutes. i was learned that by a young lady i was gardener to. mistress mary felt her face grow red. she was almost afraid to answer. if no one found out about the secret garden she should enjoy herself always. she stayed with him for ten or fifteen minutes longer and asked him as many questions as she dared. he said something about roses just as she was going away and it reminded her of the ones he had said he had been fond of. get thee gone an play thee. she liked old ben weatherstaff. yes she did like him. she always wanted to try to make him talk to her. also she began to believe that he knew everything in the world about flowers. it was a very strange thing indeed. she quite caught her breath as she stopped to look at it. a boy was sitting under a tree with his back against it playing on a rough wooden pipe. he was a funny looking boy about twelve. he stopped playing his pipe and began to rise from the ground. eh she wished she could talk as he did. his speech was so quick and easy. she liked it very much and when she looked into his funny face with the red cheeks and round blue eyes she forgot that she had felt shy. look at me. hes took thee on. she did so want to know. see hes making up to thee now. he told her what they looked like when they were flowers he told her how to plant them and watch them and feed and water them. she did not know what to say so for a whole minute she said nothing. she had never thought of this. she felt miserable. and she felt as if she went red and then pale. it was true that she had turned red and then pale. dickon saw her do it and as she still said nothing he began to be puzzled. its a great secret. i dont know what i should do if anyone found it out. it isnt anybodys. nobody wants it nobody cares for it nobody ever goes into it. perhaps everything is dead in it already. nobody has any right to take it from me when i care about it and they dont. i found it myself and i got into it myself. mistress mary got up from the log at once. he felt as if he were being led to look at some strange birds nest and must move softly. she had spoken aloud and he made a sign to her. dickon nodded. no they went from tree to tree and from bush to bush. dickon carried his knife in his hand and showed her things which she thought wonderful. theres green in that wood yet. he showed her how to use the fork while he dug about roots with the spade and stirred the earth and let the air in. so i made a place for them. eh i used always to be tired. when i dig im not tired at all. she had never seen such a funny boy or such a nice one. oh what could you do for a boy like that eh of course it did seem to begin to grow for her that morning. th other ones takes two years to bloom from seed but i can bring you some bits o plants from our cottage garden. i like you and you make the fifth person. she leaned forward and asked him a question she had never dreamed of asking anyone before. and she tried to ask it in yorkshire because that was his language and in india a native was always pleased if you knew his speech. suddenly it seemed as if he might be a sort of wood fairy who might be gone when she came into the garden again. he seemed too good to be true. her dinner was waiting on the table and martha was waiting near it. hed be sure to bring em if they was in yorkshire. this was when she began to ask where the flowers were to be planted. she liked him. why he didnt want to see me when i came. medlock says its because o mother. shed never spoke to him before but mrs. craven had been to our cottage two or three times. hed forgot but mother hadnt an she made bold to stop him. hes goin to travel in foreign places. if he did not come back until winter or even autumn there would be time to watch the secret garden come alive. even if he found out then and took it away from her she would have had that much at least. she looked nervous and excited. martha help her to slip on her best dress. she did not even answer mrs. medlock but turned and walked into her bedroom followed by martha. what was there for her to say she was obliged to go and see mr. craven and he would not like her and she would not like him. she knew what he would think of her. she was taken to a part of the house she had not been into before. he turned his head over his high shoulders and spoke to her. mary went to him. he was not ugly. his face would have been handsome if it had not been so miserable. what an unhappy face he had his black eyes seemed as if they scarcely saw her as if they were seeing something else and he could hardly keep his thoughts upon her. she came a step nearer to him. her anxious little face seemed to worry him more than ever. i am your guardian though i am a poor one for any child. i cannot give you time or attention. i dont know anything about children but mrs. medlock is to see that you have all you need. her daughter had talked about you. now i have seen you i think she said sensible things. play out of doors as much as you like. its a big place and you may go where you like and amuse yourself as you like. mr. craven looked quite startled. he gazed at her a moment and then passed his hand quickly over his eyes. i sometimes made little beds in the sand and stuck flowers in them. when he stopped and spoke to her his dark eyes looked almost soft and kind. she must be less delicate before she begins lessons. give her simple healthy food. let her run wild in the garden. dont look after her too much. miss mary can get no harm from them. she found martha waiting there. martha had in fact hurried back after she had removed the dinner service. your mother is coming to see me and i may go to your cottage she ran to them looking all round the place but there was no dickon to be seen. at first she could not tell what it was. then she saw it was meant for a nest with a bird sitting on it. he had meant that she might be sure he would keep her secret. oh how she did like that queer common boy she hoped he would come back the very next day and she fell asleep looking forward to the morning. she was awakened in the night by the sound of rain beating with heavy drops against her window. mary sat up in bed and felt miserable and angry. she had been lying awake turning from side to side for about an hour when suddenly something made her sit up in bed and turn her head toward the door listening. she listened and she listened. it is different. she listened for a few minutes and each minute she became more and more sure. she felt as if she must find out what it was. it seemed even stranger than the secret garden and the buried key. she put her foot out of bed and stood on the floor. the corridor looked very long and dark but she was too excited to mind that. the sound had come up that passage. so she went on with her dim light almost feeling her way her heart beating so loud that she fancied she could hear it. sometimes it stopped for a moment or so and then began again. was this the right corner to turn she stopped and thought. yes it was. down this passage and then to the left and then up two broad steps and then to the right again. she pushed it open very gently and closed it behind her and she stood in the corridor and could hear the crying quite plainly though it was not loud. it was on the other side of the wall at her left and a few yards farther on there was a door. the someone was crying in that room and it was quite a young someone. so she walked to the door and pushed it open and there she was standing in the room it was a big room with ancient handsome furniture in it. mary wondered if she was in a real place or if she had fallen asleep again and was dreaming without knowing it. the boy had a sharp delicate face the color of ivory and he seemed to have eyes too big for it. he had also a lot of hair which tumbled over his forehead in heavy locks and made his thin face seem smaller. he looked like a boy who had been ill but he was crying more as if he were tired and cross than as if he were in pain. mary stood near the door with her candle in her hand holding her breath. then she crept across the room and as she drew nearer the light attracted the boys attention and he turned his head on his pillow and stared at her his gray eyes opening so wide that they seemed immense. mary could not help noticing what strange eyes he had. she came close to the bed and he put out his hand and touched her. my father wont let people talk me over either. the servants are not allowed to speak about me. everything is a kind of secret. i stay in this room because i dont want to be moved out of it. generally when i am asleep. a sort of angry shadow passed over the boys face. he thinks i dont know but ive heard people talking. i used to wear an iron thing to keep my back straight but a grand doctor came from london to see me and said it was stupid. he told them to take it off and keep me out in the fresh air. mary thought of something all at once. she did not want to go away at all. she answered all these questions and many more and he lay back on his pillow and listened. he made her tell him a great deal about india and about her voyage across the ocean. she found out that because he had been an invalid he had not learned things as other children had. he never seemed to have been amused however. he could have anything he asked for and was never made to do anything he did not like to do. he seemed to like the sound of marys voice. but at last he asked a question which opened up a new subject. who did it but it was too late to be careful. he was too much like herself. he too had had nothing to think about and the idea of a hidden garden attracted him as it had attracted her. he asked question after question. where was it had she never looked for the door if he could make people answer questions who knew what might happen they all know that. he thought that the whole world belonged to him. at first they thought i was too little to understand and now they think i dont hear. but i do. my doctor is my fathers cousin. talk about that garden. i want the key dug up. i would let them take me there in my chair. that would be getting fresh air. dickon would never come back. he stared as if he thought she had gone crazy dont you see they dont know i know that so it is a sort of secret. and then she told him about the robin and ben weatherstaff and there was so much to tell about the robin and it was so easy and safe to talk about it that she ceased to be afraid. what a lot of things you know. he evidently did not expect an answer and the next moment he gave her a surprise. it was a curtain of soft silk hanging over what seemed to be some picture. it was the picture of a girl with a laughing face. and my father would not have hated to look at me. i dare say i should have had a strong back. she smiles too much when i am ill and miserable. i can always send the nurse out of the room and say that i want to be by myself. the nurse went away yesterday to stay all night with her sister and she always makes martha attend to me when she wants to go out. so she got up softly took her candle and crept away without making a sound. there could be no going out of doors. martha was so busy that mary had no opportunity of talking to her but in the afternoon she asked her to come and sit with her in the nursery. martha let her knitting drop on her knee and gazed at her with startled eyes. it was colin. thall get me in trouble. hes a big lad to cry like a baby but when hes in a passion hell fair scream just to frighten us. he wouldnt let me go. he let me see his mothers picture. i looked at him all the time and he looked at me. and he wants me to come and talk to him every day. i just went into his room and i was so surprised to see him i stood and stared. and then he turned round and stared at me. and he thought i was a ghost or a dream and i thought perhaps he was. and it was so queer being there alone together in the middle of the night and not knowing about each other. and we began to ask each other questions. craven went off his head like when he was born. it was because mrs. craven died like i told you. he wouldnt set eyes on th baby. mother said that there was enough trouble and raging in th house to set any child wrong. eh mrs. medlock did get a fright then. hes told the nurse to stay away until six oclock. im to wait in the next room. she did not want to see colin as much as she wanted to see dickon but she wanted to see him very much. there was a bright fire on the hearth when she entered his room and in the daylight she saw it was a very beautiful room indeed. colin looked rather like a picture himself. he had a red spot on each cheek. poor martha was shaking in her shoes. he spoke to his people just as you spoke to martha. she had liked to hear martha talk about him. besides she longed to talk about him. it would seem to bring him nearer. he says its because he lives on the moor so much and he knows their ways. he says he feels sometimes as if he was a bird or a rabbit himself he likes them so. i think he asked the robin questions. he keeps them secret so that other boys wont find their holes and frighten them. i thought it was hideous. martha told me about it first and then dickon. he looked like a person listening to a new sound in the distance and wondering what it was. mary was silent for a minute and then she said something bold. how could i she didnt like the way he had of talking about dying. that made colin turn and look at her again. and then he lay back on his cushion and was still as if he were thinking. and there was quite a long silence. perhaps they were both of them thinking strange things children do not usually think of. i heard him say one thing quite aloud. he said the lad might live if he would make up his mind to it. she felt as if she would like this thing to be settled one way or the other. hes always talking about live things. he has such round blue eyes and they are so wide open with looking about. let us talk about living. let us talk and talk about dickon. they enjoyed themselves so much that they forgot the pictures and they forgot about the time. they had been laughing quite loudly over ben weatherstaff and his robin and colin was actually sitting up as if he had forgotten about his weak back when he suddenly remembered something. and in the midst of the fun the door opened and in walked dr. craven and mrs. medlock. colin answered as if neither the doctors alarm nor mrs. medlocks terror were of the slightest consequence. i like her. i am glad she came. she makes me better. the nurse must bring up her tea with mine. she stayed with me a long time. i wanted my breakfast. i want my tea now. he talked to the nurse for a few minutes when she came into the room and said a few words of warning to colin. he must not talk too much he must not forget that he was ill he must not forget that he was very easily tired. mary thought that there seemed to be a number of uncomfortable things he was not to forget. he gave a puzzled glance at the little girl sitting on the large stool. though there had been no chance to see either the secret garden or dickon mistress mary had enjoyed herself very much. the week had not seemed long. they had looked at the splendid books and pictures and sometimes mary had read things to colin and sometimes he had read a little to her. there were certain things she wanted to find out from him but she felt that she must find them out without asking him direct questions. in the first place as she began to like to be with him she wanted to discover whether he was the kind of boy you could tell a secret to. he was not in the least like dickon but he was evidently so pleased with the idea of a garden no one knew anything about that she thought perhaps he could be trusted. but she had not known him long enough to be sure. the grand doctor had said that he must have fresh air and colin had said that he would not mind fresh air in a secret garden. perhaps if he had a great deal of fresh air and knew dickon and the robin and saw things growing he might not think so much about dying. mary had seen herself in the glass sometimes lately when she had realized that she looked quite a different creature from the child she had seen when she arrived from india. even martha had seen a change in her. but then if he hated people to look at him perhaps he would not like to see dickon. then she began to smile slowly. he lay back on his cushion and paused thoughtfully. what mary felt afterward was that she need not fear about dickon. the moor was blue and the whole world looked as if something magic had happened to it. mary put her hand out of the window and held it in the sun. no one is up. six months before mistress mary would not have seen how the world was waking up but now she missed nothing. she hoped he was not going to stay inside and she pushed the door open wondering if he would. mary flew across the grass to him. how could you an i come straight here. i couldnt have stayed away. an eh mary bent her face down and kissed and kissed them. there was every joy on earth in the secret garden that morning and in the midst of them came a delight more delightful than all because it was more wonderful. dickon stood quite still and put his hand on mary almost as if they had suddenly found themselves laughing in a church. its ben weatherstaffs robin. hell be a good bit different till all this is over. us must keep still a bit an
try to look as if us was grass an trees an bushes. he turned his head to look at her. i have been to talk to him every day this week. he wants me to come. dickon looked actually relieved as soon as the surprise died away from his round face. it makes me easier. how did tha find out about him martha was in fine trouble th last time she came home. mother she says thats th
worst thing on earth for a child. presently he lifted his head and looked round the garden. it is as if a green mist were creeping over it. i thought perhaps you could push his carriage. he wont go out for other people and perhaps they will be glad if he will go out with us. but he likes to hear about this garden because it is a secret. dickon spoke to him as ben weatherstaff did but dickons tone was one of friendly advice. tha knew how to build tha nest before tha came out o th egg. get on with thee lad. when mary wanted to rest a little dickon sat down with her under a tree and once he took his pipe out of his pocket and played the soft strange little notes and two squirrels appeared on the wall and looked and listened. medlock will have to get me some bigger dresses. she ran back to the house as quickly as her feet would carry her. she felt sure he would like to hear. theres been a nice to do all afternoon to keep him quiet. and she felt she was quite right but of course now she felt that colin was quite wrong. he was not on his sofa when she went into his room. he was lying flat on his back in bed and he did not turn his head toward her as she came in. this was a bad beginning and mary marched up to him with her stiff manner. mary flew into a fine passion. she could fly into a passion without making a noise. i wont even look at you. as it was they did the next thing to it. anyone is selfish who doesnt do what they want. youre more selfish than i am. he keeps you playing in the dirt when he knows i am all by myself. the truth was that he had never had a fight with anyone like himself in his life and upon the whole it was rather good for him though neither he nor mary knew anything about that. he turned his head on his pillow and shut his eyes and a big tear was squeezed out and ran down his cheek. he opened his eyes quite wide with indignation. he had never heard such a thing said before. he was at once furious and slightly pleased if a person could be both at one time. you know i am i believe youre proud of it. i dont believe it she was cross and disappointed but not at all sorry for colin. she had looked forward to telling him a great many things and she had meant to try to make up her mind whether it would be safe to trust him with the great secret. she had been beginning to think it would be but now she had changed her mind entirely. she would never tell him and he could stay in his room and never get any fresh air and die if he liked it would serve him right but he had not sent one. there were several beautiful books such as colin had and two of them were about gardens and were full of pictures. everything was so nice that her pleasure began to crowd her anger out of her mind. she had not expected him to remember her at all and her hard little heart grew quite warm. he had a way of doing that which she could not bear. it gave her an uncomfortable frightened feeling because he always looked so frightened himself. something he had heard mrs. medlock whispering to the nurse had given him the idea and he had thought over it in secret until it was quite firmly fixed in his mind. mary had been sorry for him when he had told her. the next minute she felt quite sure she knew. even when she pressed her hands more tightly over her ears she could not keep the awful sounds out. she took her hands from her ears and sprang up and stamped her foot. somebody ought to make him stop just then she heard feet almost running down the corridor and her door opened and the nurse came in. she was not laughing now by any means. she even looked rather pale. no one can do anything with him. you come and try like a good child. the stamp rather pleased the nurse. give him something new to think of. she felt quite wicked by the time she reached the door. i hate you i wish everybody would run out of the house and let you scream yourself to death he had been lying on his face beating his pillow with his hands and he actually almost jumped around he turned so quickly at the sound of the furious little voice. the scream which had been coming almost choked him. he was probably like herself and had never heard it before. all three had gasped with fright more than once. the nurse came forward as if she were half afraid. theres not a lump as big as a pin his back is weak because he wont try to sit up. actually the tears meant that a curious great relief had come to him. presently he turned and looked at the nurse again and strangely enough he was not like a rajah at all as he spoke to her. then she made colin a cup of beef tea and gave a cup to mary who really was very glad to get it after her excitement. mrs. medlock and martha gladly slipped away and after everything was neat and calm and in order the nurse looked as if she would very gladly slip away also. the nurse was out of the room in a minute and as soon as she was gone colin pulled marys hand again. i wont talk and ill go to sleep but you said you had a whole lot of nice things to tell me. if i could get into it i think i should live to grow up mary ate her breakfast slowly as she listened. nobody else would have dared to do it. eh poor lad hes been spoiled till salt wont save him. she doesnt know which is th worst. tha was in a fine temper thaself too. but he says to me when i went into his room please ask miss mary if shell please come an talk to me think o him saying please she had her hat on when she appeared in colins room and for a second he looked disappointed. he was in bed. the fox and the crow were with him again and this time he had brought two tame squirrels. i brought these two in my pockets. he looked up at the sky and all about him. eh my but she loved his broad yorkshire and had in fact been trying to learn to speak it herself. so she spoke a little now. she had never made a long speech in yorkshire before and she had remembered very well. colin began to laugh. eh mary had run round into the wood with dickon to see jump. i think you are like him too. he said we were neither of us much to look at and we were as sour as we looked. colin knew something new was coming. mary was so anxious that she got up from her stool and came to him and caught hold of both his hands. i trusted dickon because birds trusted him. her face was so solemn that he almost whispered his answer. there is a door into the garden. i found it. shall i get into it how shes done it theres no telling. the lord knows shes nothing to look at and you scarcely ever hear her speak but she did what none of us dare do. he was rather a nervous man. i am always better when she is with me. she made me better last night. who is he she felt somehow that everybody who knew the moor must know dickon. and she was right too. very clever people try to learn them. when he went downstairs he looked very thoughtful and when he talked to mrs. medlock in the library she felt that he was a much puzzled man. instead of lying and staring at the wall and wishing he had not awakened his mind was full of the plans he and mary had made yesterday of pictures of the garden and of dickon and his wild creatures. it was so nice to have things to think about. and he had not been awake more than ten minutes when he heard feet running along the corridor and mary was at the door. youve been out it has come i thought it had come that other morning but it was only coming. it is here now it has come the spring he actually sat up in bed. thats what dickon does when hes lying on the moor. he had taken it to the cottage wrapped in his jacket and he had let it lie near the fire and had fed it with warm milk. it was a soft thing with a darling silly baby face and legs rather long for its body. a living lamb who lay on your lap like a baby she started a little at the sight of the open window. it makes you strong. i am going to get up to the sofa for breakfast. she found the servants hall a more amusing place than the invalids chamber and just now everybody wanted to hear the news from upstairs. the boy is marthas brother. they ate their breakfast with the morning air pouring in upon them. colins breakfast was a very good one and mary watched him with serious interest. in about ten minutes mary held up her hand. but dickon did not feel the least shy or awkward. creatures were always like that until they found out about you. of course no boy could have helped speaking then. after that there was no wondering what to say. by the time the lamb fell asleep questions poured forth and dickon answered them all. eh i did have a look for it. nothing must spoil that. no one must ever suspect that they had a secret. people must think that he was simply going out with mary and dickon because he liked them and did not object to their looking at him. the young rajah was neither in bed nor on his sofa. no one is to be there. the rajah waved his hand. outside in the corridor being a rather goodnatured man he smiled until he almost laughed. she did not think he looked tired but he was very quiet before their lunch came and he was quiet while they were eating it. she wondered why and asked him about it. i scarcely ever went out and when i did go i never looked at it. its come you made me feel quite queer. and if all the flowers and leaves and green things and birds and wild creatures danced past at once what a crowd it would be a little later the nurse made colin ready. she noticed that instead of lying like a log while his clothes were put on he sat up and made some efforts to help himself and he talked and laughed with mary all the time. mistress mary walked beside it and colin leaned back and lifted his face to the sky. a few yards more and mary whispered again. where not till then did he take them away and look round and round and round as dickon and mary had done. and the sun fell warm upon his face like a hand with a lovely touch. and in wonder mary and dickon stood and stared at him. dickon i shall get well one knows it then for a moment or so. more than once dickon paused in what he was doing and stood still with a sort of growing wonder in his eyes shaking his head softly. mary and dickon worked a little here and there and colin watched them. it was like being taken in state round the country of a magic king and queen and shown all the mysterious riches it contained. every moment of the afternoon was full of new things and every hour the sunshine grew more golden. dickon looked across the grass at the tree and mary looked and there was a brief moment of stillness. mary gazed at the tree and thought. it wont look dead then. there he is colin leaned back on his cushion again laughing a little. perhaps its five oclock. but she had not felt as if she looked cheerful when she gazed at the tree. she wondered and wondered in those few moments if there was any reality in that other thing dickon had said. they have to come back tha sees. secretly she quite believed that dickon worked magic of course good magic on everything near him and that was why people liked him so much and wild creatures knew he was their friend. she wondered indeed if it were not possible that his gift had brought the robin just at the right moment when colin asked that dangerous question. she felt that his magic was working all the afternoon and making colin look like an entirely different boy. it did not seem possible that he could be the crazy creature who had screamed and beaten and bitten his pillow. the faint glow of color which had shown on his face and neck and hands when he first got inside the garden really never quite died away. he looked as if he were made of flesh instead of ivory or wax. im going to see everything grow here. neither he nor mary had ever asked if anything was the matter with his legs. they were really very quiet for a little while. the sun was dropping lower. even the creatures had ceased moving about and had drawn together and were resting near them. colin pointed to the high wall. he actually shook his fist at mary. him eh and it stopped right under ben weatherstaffs nose. it was really no wonder his mouth dropped open. how ben weatherstaff stared his red old eyes fixed themselves on what was before him as if he were seeing a ghost. lord knows how tha come here. his hand shook and his mouth shook and his voice shook. it was too much. come here he can do it he can do it and you are to obey me. this is my garden. dont dare to say a word about it you get down from that ladder and go out to the long walk and miss mary will meet you and bring you here. i want to talk to you. we did not want you but now you will have to be in the secret. it seemed as if he could not take his eyes from thin straight colin standing on his feet with his head thrown back. dickon was watching him with sharp eyes. then suddenly he remembered something mary had said. colin looked down at them. i can rest against the tree if i like. when i want to sit down i will sit down but not before. when he stood against the tree trunk it was not too plain that he supported himself against it and he still held himself so straight that he looked tall. when ben weatherstaff came through the door in the wall he saw him standing there and he heard mary muttering something under her breath. but she did not tell him. you can do it i told you you could you can do it you can do it she could not bear that he should give in before ben weatherstaff. he did not give in. thas got too much pluck in thee. when i seed thee put tha legs on th ground in such a hurry i knowed tha was all right. mary had poured out speech as rapidly as she could as they had come down the long walk. the garden was doing it. i am fond of it. my orders are that no one is to know that we come here. dickon and my cousin have worked and made it come alive. i come over th wall. colin stretched out his hand and took it up. an odd expression came into his face and he began to scratch at the earth. ben weatherstaff looked on with interested face. he looked up at the sky flushed and glowing with the strangely new exercise slight as it was. mary thought that perhaps the sun held back a few minutes just on purpose. he had begun to be excited too. it was filled in and pressed down and made steady. mary was leaning forward on her hands and knees. help me up dickon. i want to be standing when it goes. when colin was brought back to his room the poor man looked him over seriously. so she sat and looked at him curiously for a few minutes after dr. craven had gone. she wanted to make him ask her why she was doing it and of course she did. i wont let people think im one. he was a very proud boy. he lay thinking for a while and then mary saw his beautiful smile begin and gradually change his whole face. oh the things which happened in that garden if you have never had a garden you cannot understand and if you have had a garden you will know that it would take a whole book to describe all that came to pass there. in its happy days flowers had been tucked away into every inch and hole and corner. colin saw it all watching each change as it took place. every morning he was brought out and every hour of each day when it didnt rain he spent in the garden. even gray days pleased him. and this was not the half of the magic. he talked of it constantly. perhaps the beginning is just to say nice things are going to happen until you make them happen. ben came as quickly as he could and found the rajah standing on his feet under a tree and looking very grand but also very beautifully smiling. so he could reply like a sailor. i believe dickon knows some magic but perhaps he doesnt know he knows it. i had never watched things before and it made me feel very curious. scientific people are always curious and i am going to be scientific. i keep saying to myself what is it what is it its something. it cant be nothing i dont know its name so i call it magic. i have never seen the sun rise but mary and dickon have and from what they tell me i am sure that is magic too. sometimes since ive been in the garden ive looked up through the trees at the sky and i have had a strange feeling of being happy as if something were pushing and drawing in my chest and making me breathe fast. magic is always pushing and drawing and making things out of nothing. so it must be all around us. the magic in this garden has made me stand up and know i am going to live to be a man. i am going to make the scientific experiment of trying to get some and put it in myself and make it push and draw me and make me strong. i dont know how to do it but i think that if you keep thinking about it and calling it perhaps it will come. perhaps that is the first baby way to get it. when i was going to try to stand that first time mary kept saying to herself as fast as she could you can do it you can do it
and i did. magic is making me well i am going to be as strong as dickon as strong as dickon and you must all do it too. you learn things by saying them over and over and thinking about them until they stay in your mind forever and i think it will be the same with magic. then he cheered up. she used the wrong magic until she made him beat her. itll work for sure. he held his head high as if he felt like a sort of priest and his strange eyes had a wonderful look in them. they were all too much in earnest. colins face was not even crossed by a shadow. he was thinking only of the magic. and he began looking like a strange boy spirit. that is the magic. that is the magic. its in everyone of us. its in ben weatherstaffs back. magic magic she felt as if it were at once queer and beautiful and she wanted him to go on and on. at last colin stopped. i heard every bit of it. you said th magic was in my back. you have my permission to go to your work. the rajah did not object to his staying and so the procession was formed. it really did look like a procession. colin was at its head with dickon on one side and mary on the other. it was a procession which moved slowly but with dignity. every few yards it stopped to rest. his head was held up all the time and he looked very grand. i can feel it this is to be the biggest secret of all. no one is to know anything about it until i have grown so strong that i can walk and run like any other boy. i shall come here every day in my chair and i shall be taken back in it. i wont have people whispering and asking questions and i wont let my father hear about it until the experiment has quite succeeded. i am quite well and i shall live to be a man. he had made himself believe that he was going to get well which was really more than half the battle if he had been aware of it. anythingll grow for him. after supper there was still a long clear twilight to work in and that was her quiet time. she could sit upon the low rough wall and look on and hear stories of the day. she loved this time. there were not only vegetables in this garden. they want to live same as we do. his eyes were twinkling with fun. does it hurt you so much when we get safe into the garden they laugh till theyve no breath left to laugh with. tha
always sees a way out o things. he asked a number of questions to colins great annoyance. everyone has orders to keep out of the way. i wont be watched and stared at. if you can keep this up my boy we need not talk of dying. i might have a raging fever. i feel as if i might be beginning to have one now. you are making me angry and you know that is bad for me. i feel hot already. but of course he is doing now of his own free will what we could not make him do before. perhaps i couldnt have one at all. that lump doesnt come in my throat now and i keep thinking of nice things instead of horrible ones. what a kind clever woman she must be and what delicious fresh milk she is a magic person. he enjoyed them. he liked this so much that he improved upon it. you could buy both potatoes and eggs and eat as many as you liked without feeling as if you were taking food out of the mouths of fourteen people. each day he grew stronger and could walk more steadily and cover more ground. he tried one experiment after another as he felt himself gaining strength and it was dickon who showed him the best things of all. hes the strongest chap on th moor. show me he could do a few while he was sitting down. mary began to do them also. she almost cried. he had been called to london on business and had not seen the boy for nearly two weeks. when young things begin to gain health they gain it rapidly. dr. craven held his chin in his hand and thought him over. mary became quite severe in her manner. her hairs grown thick and healthy looking and shes got a bright color. but they all knew it and felt it and the robin and his mate knew they knew it. at first the robin watched mary and colin with sharp anxiety. for some mysterious reason he knew he need not watch dickon. he could speak robin which is a quite distinct language not to be mistaken for any other. they never startled one by being sudden enough to seem dangerous or threatening. in the first place the boy creature did not come into the garden on his legs. when the boy began to walk by himself and even to move more quickly it was an immense relief. one day the robin remembered that when he himself had been made to learn to fly by his parents he had done much the same sort of thing. after a while the boy began to move about as the others did but all three of the children at times did unusual things. they would stand under the trees and move their arms and legs and heads about in a way which was neither walking nor running nor sitting down. fears for the eggs became things of the past. on wet days the eggs mother sometimes felt even a little dull because the children did not come into the garden. but even on wet days it could not be said that mary and colin were dull. they want to be doing things all the time. i cant stand lying still and pretending and besides i look too different. no one ever knew though mrs. medlock nearly found me out. i lost my way when i was coming back and i stopped at the end of your corridor. suppose we go and look at them. when the nurse came in he gave his orders. as soon as mary had made sure that john was really on his way back to his own quarters below stairs colin got out of his chair. they lived a long time ago. they went to the indian room and amused themselves with the ivory elephants. i like it. she had noticed it the day before but had said nothing because she thought the change might have been made by chance. she could look at it because the curtain had been drawn aside. that was the change she noticed. you are wondering why the curtain is drawn back. i got up and looked out of the window. she looked right down at me as if she were laughing because she was glad i was standing there. it made me like to look at her. i want to see her laughing like that all the time. he thought it over and then answered her slowly. if he grew fond of me i think i should tell him about the magic. they always had plenty to do after a warm deep sinking rain. i am making it up now. all at once he had realized something to the full. dickon was looking at him very hard. he saw some of them now in this boy. mary looked hard too but she said nothing. and it is real im well im well i was always too ill. sing it dickon. he understood what colin felt better than colin did himself. he pulled off his cap and looked round still smiling. how can we know the exact names of everything sing it again dickon. let us try mary. i want to sing it too. its my song. how does it begin she had come in with the last line of their song and she had stood still listening and looking at them. dickons eyes lighted like lamps. colin began to move toward her too and mary went with him. she flushed and the corners of her mouth shook and a mist seemed to sweep over her eyes. she might have said it to dickon in the same way if she had seen something in his face which touched her. colin liked it. she put her hand on his shoulder and smiled the mist out of her eyes. our martha told me as mrs. medlock heard she was a pretty woman. mary had not had time to pay much attention to her changing face. colin walked on one side of her and mary on the other. it isnt like us poor fools as think it matters if us is called out of our names. it would ha listened to anything thad sung. eh she was full of fun and made them laugh at all sorts of odd things. she told them stories in broad yorkshire and taught them new words. i keep thinking suppose colins face should get to look like a full moon. i would that they planned it all. they would see all the twelve children and dickons garden and would not come back until they were tired. the quick mist swept over her eyes. if you let it stay there after it has got in you may never get over it as long as you live. circumstances however were very kind to her though she was not at all aware of it. they began to push her about for her own good. two things cannot be in one place. he had forgotten and deserted his home and his duties. most strangers thought he must be either half mad or a man with some hidden crime on his soul. he had been on the tops of mountains whose heads were in the clouds and had looked down on other mountains when the sun rose and touched them with such light as made it seem as if the world were just being born. but the light had never seemed to touch himself until one day when he realized that for the first time in ten years a strange thing had happened. he had walked a long way and it had not lifted his. but at last he had felt tired and had thrown himself down to rest on a carpet of moss by a stream. it seemed like a thing alive and yet its tiny voice made the stillness seem deeper. the valley was very very still. he wondered if he were going to sleep but he was not. he was actually thinking tenderly how lovely it was and what wonders of blue its hundreds of little blossoms were. but of course he did not think of this himself. neither does anyone else yet. he did not know that it could be kept. he left the valley and went on his wandering way again. but by this time he had begun to sleep better he knew and his dreams had ceased to be a terror to him. he did not know when he fell asleep and when he began to dream his dream was so real that he did not feel as if he were dreaming. it was sweet and clear and happy and far away. it seemed very far but he heard it as distinctly as if it had been at his very side. it was such a real voice and it seemed so natural that he should hear it. when he did awake at last it was brilliant morning and a servant was standing staring at him. when he had gone away mr. craven sat a few moments holding them in his hand and looking at the lake. it was directed in a plain womans hand but it was not a hand he knew. it was about miss mary i spoke. i will make bold to speak again. please sir i would come home if i was you. he kept thinking about the dream. during those years he had only wished to forget him. he had refused to see it and when he had gone to look at it at last it had been such a weak wretched thing that everyone had been sure it would die in a few days. he had not meant to be a bad father but he had not felt like a father at all. this he had yet to learn. but the calm had brought a sort of courage and hope with it. instead of giving way to thoughts of the worst he actually found he was trying to believe in better things. he went into the library and sent for mrs. medlock. mrs. medlock really was flushed. you never knew sir perhaps that out of doors he never would let himself be taken. the things weve gone through to get him to go out in his chair would leave a body trembling like a leaf. he never used to laugh at all. dr. craven is coming to see you at once if youll allow him. he did not walk quickly but slowly and his eyes were on the path. as he drew near to it his step became still more slow. was he losing his reason and thinking he heard things which were not for human ears was it that the far clear voice had meant he was a tall boy and a handsome one. he was glowing with life and his running had sent splendid color leaping to his face. he had never thought of such a meeting. you cant believe it. i scarcely can myself. no one knows. we kept it to tell you when you came. im well i can beat mary in a race. colin put out his hand and laid it on his fathers arm. he knew he dared not even try to speak for a moment. he looked round and round. one of the windows looking upon the courtyard gave also a glimpse of the lawn. mrs. medlock knowing ben had come from the gardens hoped that he might have caught sight of his master and even by chance of his meeting with master colin. how did he look but ill tell thee this. how large are their eyes and so young too it pleased him to see mother and father wolf look uncomfortable. that is why he has only killed cattle. he made his bound before he saw what it was he was jumping at and then he tried to stop himself. the result was that he shot up straight into the air for four or five feet landing almost where he left ground. he looked up into father wolfs face and laughed. the baby was pushing his way between the cubs to get close to the warm hide. he is taking his meal with the others. and so this is a mans cub. but father wolf knew that the mouth of the cave was too narrow for a tiger to come in by. he shall not be killed. shere khan might have faced father wolf but he could not stand up against mother wolf for he knew that where he was she had all the advantage of the ground and would fight to the death. the cub must be shown to the pack. keep him lie still little frog. the punishment is death where the murderer can be found and if you think for a minute you will see that this must be so. the lone wolf had led them for a year now. there was very little talking at the rock. give him to me. what have the free people to do with the orders of any save the free people there is no harm in a mans cub. i have no gift of words but i speak the truth. let him run with the pack and be entered with the others. and the law does not say who may or may not pay that price. the cub can be bought for a price. besides he may make better sport for you when he is grown. what harm can a naked frog do us let him run with the pack. where is the bull bagheera at last they all went down the hill for the dead bull and only akela bagheera baloo and mowglis own wolves were left. shere khan roared still in the night for he was very angry that mowgli had not been handed over to him. akela said nothing. he grew up with the cubs though they of course were grown wolves almost before he was a child. when he was not learning he sat out in the sun and slept and ate and went to sleep again. he took his place at the council rock too when the pack met and there he discovered that if he stared hard at any wolf the wolf would be forced to drop his eyes and so he used to stare for fun. as soon as he was old enough to understand things bagheera told him that he must never touch cattle because he had been bought into the pack at the price of a bulls life. and he grew and grew strong as a boy must grow who does not know that he is learning any lessons and who has nothing in the world to think of except things to eat. mother wolf told him once or twice that shere khan was not a creature to be trusted and that some day he must kill shere khan. but though a young wolf would have remembered that advice every hour mowgli forgot it because he was only a boy though he would have called himself a wolf if he had been able to speak in any human tongue. bagheera who had eyes and ears everywhere knew something of this and once or twice he told mowgli in so many words that shere khan would kill him some day. baloo knows it i know it the pack know it and even the foolish foolish deer know. open those eyes little brother. shere khan dare not kill thee in the jungle. yes i too was born among men. i had never seen the jungle. and because i had learned the ways of men i became more terrible in the jungle than shere khan. and mowgli looked at him steadily between the eyes. strike first and then give tongue. but be wise. he came to the cave as the evening mist rose and drew breath and looked down the valley. akela let the lone wolf show his strength. room for the leader of the pack i am ready. why should i fear then mowgli went to the council still laughing. bagheera lay close to mowgli and the fire pot was between mowglis knees. when they were all gathered together shere khan began to speak a thing he would never have dared to do when akela was in his prime. he is a dogs son. now i have missed my kill. ye know how that plot was made. your right is to kill me here on the council rock now. therefore i ask who comes to make an end of the lone wolf he is doomed to die free people he was my meat from the first. give him to me. he has troubled the jungle for ten seasons. a man what has a man to do with us he has slept with us. he has driven game for us. in truth i have lived too long. i will die without fighting. that will at least save the pack three lives. ye have told me so often tonight that i am a man and indeed i would have been a wolf with you to my lifes end that i feel your words are true. what ye will do and what ye will not do is not yours to say. i go from you to my own people if they be my own people. thus and thus then do we beat dogs when we are men. but remember when next i come to the council rock as a man should come it will be with shere khans hide on my head. ye will not kill him because that is not my will. at last there were only akela bagheera and perhaps ten wolves that had taken mowglis part. then something began to hurt mowgli inside him as he had never been hurt in his life before and he caught his breath and sobbed and the tears ran down his face. let them fall mowgli. do not forget me as the dawn was breaking the wolf pack yelled         once twice and again feet in the jungle that leave no mark eyes that can see in the dark the dark tongue give tongue to it hark o hark once twice and again let him         think and be still. it was in the days when baloo was teaching him the law of the jungle. the boy could climb almost as well as he could swim and swim almost as well as he could run. no. he can now claim protection if he will only remember the words from all in the jungle. but what are those master words see o bagheera they never thank their teacher. the cool of the summer sun why have i never been taken among the monkey people they stand on their feet as i do. they do not hit me with their hard paws. they play all day. let me get up bad baloo let me up they have no law. their way is not our way. they have no remembrance. we do not drink where the monkeys drink we do not go where the monkeys go we do not hunt where they hunt we do not die where they die. how was i to guess he would play with such dirt. the monkey people what baloo had said about the monkeys was perfectly true. none of the beasts could reach them but on the other hand none of the beasts would notice them and that was why they were so pleased when mowgli came to play with them and they heard how angry baloo was. this time they said they were really going to have a leader and become the wisest people in the jungle so wise that everyone else would notice and envy them. bagheera has noticed us. had they been alone they could have gone twice as fast but the boys weight held them back. for a time he was afraid of being dropped. then he grew angry but knew better than to struggle and then he began to think. the first thing was to send back word to baloo and bagheera for at the pace the monkeys were going he knew his friends would be left far behind. meantime baloo and bagheera were furious with rage and grief. bagheera climbed as he had never climbed before but the thin branches broke beneath his weight and he slipped down his claws full of bark. o haste sit still and think make a plan. this is no time for chasing. they may have dropped him already being tired of carrying him. give me black bones to eat o mowgli mowgli he can climb as well as they can. the whisper of his name makes their wicked tails cold. then he curled up ready for any accident his head lowered. good hunting bagheera. one of us at least needs food. he knew that you must not hurry kaa. he is too big. the branches are not what they were when i was young. they grow tired of the nuts they pick and throw them down. they carry a branch half a day meaning to do great things with it and then they snap it in two. how up up he bade me tell you. i watched. they may stay there for a night or ten nights or an hour. that is my message. it is nothing. the boy held the master word. follow baloo. they had brought the boy to the lost city and were very much pleased with themselves for the time. mowgli had never seen an indian city before and though this was almost a heap of ruins it seemed very wonderful and splendid. some king had built it long ago on a little hill. but they fell to fighting on the road and it was too much trouble to go back with what was left of the fruit. so if i am starved or killed here it will be all my own fault. but i must try to return to my own jungle. we are free. we are wonderful. we are the most wonderful people in all the jungle do they never go to sleep now there is a cloud coming to cover that moon. if it were only a big enough cloud i might try to run away in the darkness. the cloud hid the moon and as mowgli wondered what would come next he heard bagheeras light feet on the terrace. kill him for the first time since he was born bagheera was fighting for his life. the old bear had done his best but he could not come before. i climb i haste the stones slip under my feet then kaa came straight quickly and anxious to kill. his first stroke was delivered into the heart of the crowd round baloo. it was sent home with shut mouth in silence and there was no need of a second. it is kaa run the monkeys leaped higher up the walls. i am sore. and hide you o poison people. when thou art empty come to me and see if i speak the truth. i have some skill in these he held out his hands and if ever thou art in a trap i may pay the debt which i owe to thee to bagheera and to baloo here. but now go hence quickly with thy friends. begins now the dance the dance of the hunger of kaa. and his nose was all sore. ho i did wrong. baloo and thou are wounded. dont you wish you had extra hands now youre angry but never mind         brother thy tail hangs down behind weve forgotten but never mind         brother thy tail hangs down behind excellent wonderful once again now we are talking just like men lets pretend we are ... never mind         brother thy tail hangs down behind brother the watch was long and cold. where is the power that made your pride where is the haste that ye hurry by now we must go back to the first tale. the man stared and ran back up the one street of the village shouting for the priest who was a big fat man dressed in white with a red and yellow mark on his forehead. the priest came to the gate and with him at least a hundred people who stared and talked and shouted and pointed at mowgli. he is a handsome boy. he has eyes like red fire. she gave him a long drink of milk and some bread and then she laid her hand on his head and looked into his eyes for she thought perhaps that he might be her real son come back from the jungle where the tiger had taken him. now i am as silly and dumb as a man would be with us in the jungle. now listen. i also have made a little promise. but news is always good. i will always remember that i love thee and all in our cave. men are only men little brother and their talk is like the talk of frogs in a pond. then the little children in the village made him very angry. he did not know his own strength in the least. in the jungle he knew he was weak compared with the beasts but in the village people said that he was as strong as a bull. most of the tales were about animals for the jungle was always at their door. now he has gone off again for the game is scarce. mowgli frowned. shere khans plan is to wait for thee at the village gate this evening for thee and for no one else. fool fool what a cubs cub it is eaten and drunk too and he thinks that i shall wait till he has slept now where does he lie up if there were but ten of us we might pull him down as he lies. we must block that end. we have a big work in hand. cut the herd in two akela. another charge and they are fairly started. careful now careful akela. a snap too much and the bulls will charge. turn. swiftly turn them but mowglis plan was simple enough. let them breathe. i must tell shere khan who comes. cattle thief it is time to come to the council rock down hurry them down akela they knew what the business was before them the terrible charge of the buffalo herd against which no tiger can hope to stand. break them up. drive them away akela. my children. softly now softly his hide will look well on the council rock. the wolves dropped out of sight as soon as they saw the man coming. now it is in my mind that i need the skin for my own use. the tiger has just fed or he would have gone twenty miles by this time. he lay as still as still expecting every minute to see mowgli turn into a tiger too. mowgli went on with his work but it was nearly twilight before he and the wolves had drawn the great gay skin clear of the body. half the village seemed to be waiting for him by the gate. jungle demon go away get hence quickly or the priest will turn thee into a wolf again. wolfs cub last time it was because i was a man. this time it is because i am a wolf. i do not believe but go away or they will kill thee. this is one of the foolish tales they tell under the big tree at dusk. i have at least paid for thy sons life. let us get shere khans skin and go away. the moon was just going down when mowgli and the two wolves came to the hill of the council rock and they stopped at mother wolfs cave. not for nothing are ye called the free people. ye fought for freedom and it is yours. so mowgli went away and hunted with the four cubs in the jungle from that day on. but he was not always alone because years afterward he became a man and married. mowglis song 
     that he sang at the council rock when he      danced on shere khans hide 
     the song of mowgli i mowgli am singing. let the jungle         listen to the things i have done. shere khan said he would kill would kill at the gates in the         twilight he would kill mowgli the frog he ate and he drank. drink deep shere khan for when wilt thou         drink again sleep and dream of the kill. gray brother come to me drive them to and fro as i order. wake oh wake here come i         and the bulls are behind. he is there. he is there. up shere khan up and kill here is meat break the necks of the bulls he is asleep. we will not wake him for his strength is         very great. the black         ants have come up to know it. i am ashamed to meet all these people. lend me thy coat shere khan. by the bull that bought me i made a promise a little promise. pull gray brother pull akela heavy is         the hide of shere khan. the man pack are angry. they throw stones and talk childs talk. let me run away. through the night through the hot night run swiftly with me my         brothers. we will leave the lights of the village and go to         the low moon. i did         them no harm but they were afraid of me. why wolf pack ye have cast me out too. the jungle is shut to me and         the village gates are shut. why why i dance on the hide of shere khan but my heart is very heavy. my         mouth is cut and wounded with the stones from the village but         my heart is very light because i have come back to the jungle. why these two things fight together in me as the snakes fight in the         spring. the water comes out of my eyes yet i laugh while it         falls. why all the jungle knows that i have killed shere khan. look look         well o wolves my heart is heavy with the things that i do not understand. the white seal 
     oh they come in the summer months by hundreds and hundreds of thousands out of the cold gray sea. he would put his head on one side as though he were afraid to look his enemy in the face then he would shoot it out like lightning and when the big teeth were firmly fixed on the other seals neck the other seal might get away if he could but sea catch would not help him. yet sea catch never chased a beaten seal for that was against the rules of the beach. he only wanted room by the sea for his nursery. if we went there they would say we were afraid. are bad for baby seals dear rat         as bad as bad can be      but splash and grow strong      and you cant be wrong. child of the open sea of course the little fellow did not understand the words at first. come along come along the sea is deep and you dont know all thats in it yet. there has never been a white seal since since i was born. the men ought to skin two hundred today but its the beginning of the season and they are new to the work. a hundred will do. hundreds and hundreds of thousands of seals watched them being driven but they went on playing just the same. kotick was the only one who asked questions and none of his companions could tell him anything except that the men always drove seals in that way for six weeks or two months of every year. kotick followed panting and wondering. that was enough for kotick. he may know something. ho but none of the other seals had seen the killing and that made the difference between him and his friends. besides kotick was a white seal. or else he could see that seals had once visited the island and been killed off and kotick knew that where men had come once they would come again. and it was so in all the other islands that he visited. but everywhere the people of the sea told him the same things. seals had come to those islands once upon a time but men had killed them all off. i am old and i shall never live to see that day but others will. they bowed again and kotick began to lose his temper. but the sea cows did not answer because sea cow cannot talk. and what is good enough for the sea cow is good enough for the sea catch. he had just married that year and was making a great fuss about it. and a green light came into his eye for he was very angry at having to fight at all. ive found you the island where youll be safe but unless your heads are dragged off your silly necks you wont believe. im going to teach you now. he was not a white seal any more but red from head to tail. i met my mates in the morning and oh but i am old i met my mates in the morning ill never meet them more i met my mates in the morning a broken scattered band. this shall end when one is dead         at thy pleasure nag. turn for turn and twist for twist 
        run and hide thee nag. his eyes and the end of his restless nose were pink. he could scratch himself anywhere he pleased with any leg front or back that he chose to use. then he felt better. but he was a restless companion because he had to get up and attend to every noise all through the night and find out what made it. teddys mother and father came in the last thing to look at their boy and rikkitikki was awake on the pillow. then rikkitikki went out into the garden to see what was to be seen. nag knew that too and at the bottom of his cold heart he was afraid. so he dropped his head a little and put it on one side. rikkitikki knew better than to waste time in staring. she had crept up behind him as he was talking to make an end of him. rikkitikki did not care to follow them for he did not feel sure that he could manage two snakes at once. it was a serious matter for him. that is not true. but he is so small that nobody thinks of him and so he does the more harm to people. rikkitikki was rather amused at all the fuss which of course he did not understand. but he never gets there. nag is everywhere rikkitikki. i will kill the big man and his wife and the child if i can and come away quietly. i shall wait here till he comes. nag was asleep and rikkitikki looked at his big back wondering which would be the best place for a good hold. rikkitikki held on with his eyes shut for now he was quite sure he was dead. goodness youre safe enough in your nest there but its war for me down here. what is the use of running away i am sure to catch you. teddy and his mother and father were there at early breakfast but rikkitikki saw that they were not eating anything. i am not ready yet. wait a little. keep very still all you three if you move i strike and if you do not move i strike. look at your friends rikkitikki. they are still and white. they are afraid. he was dead before the big man blew him in two. i did it come and fight with me. fight widow the big man has gone for his gun rikkitikki jumped up and backward. he had forgotten the egg. rikkitikki knew that he must catch her or all the trouble would begin again. we must sing his death song. valiant rikkitikki is dead rikkitikki curled himself up in the grass and slept where he was slept and slept till it was late in the afternoon for he had done a hard days work. who has delivered us who tell me his nest and his name. give him the thanks of the birds         bowing with tail feathers spread praise him with nightingale words 
        nay i will praise him instead. hear here rikkitikki interrupted and the rest of the song is      lost. toomai of the elephants 
     i will remember what i was i am sick of rope and chain 
        i will remember my old strength and all my forest affairs. this running up and down among the hills is not the best government service. i am getting old and i do not love wild elephants. even a little boy could be of use there and toomai was as useful as three boys. go on go on black snake careful careful hit him hit him mind the post the worst that can happen. else why should he go hunting these wild devils it is well that this nonsense ends safely. then we will march on smooth roads and forget all this hunting. bad one wicked one shame as each man was paid he went back to his elephant and joined the line that stood ready to start. most of them had taught their elephants that trick when they were boys. little toomai was hanging eight feet up in the air and he wished very much that he were eight feet underground. that is the proper time. that was what he meant. ho ho you are very wise you plains people. art thou there well i will tell thee for thou hast a cool head. he knew that he and his father and his grandfather had done the very same thing hundreds of times before. kala nag toomai leaned forward and looked and he felt that the forest was awake below him awake and alive and crowded. but this time he was not alone and he had not to make his path. many elephants must have gone that way only a few minutes before. and these elephants were not thinking of men that night. he too must have run away from some camp in the hills about. then a cloud came over the moon and he sat in black darkness. little toomai stared again and again. the clearing as he remembered it had grown in the night. little toomai stared once more. they made more room with their feet. i have seen it. kala nag took me and i saw. when they got back to camp it was time for the evening meal. give him honor my lords together to toomai of the elephants. turn and see. my tent lay far away from the camel lines and i thought it was safe. theyre coming they are taken up mountains anywhere that a mule can find a road and they are very useful for fighting in rocky country. where shall i go all right. youll be beaten for this in the morning. hows a horse to keep his condition if he isnt allowed to sleep. listen what is that they came into our lines while we were asleep. we told your friend here that there was nothing to be afraid of but he knew so much that he thought otherwise. it means life or death to your man and of course thats life and death to you. if you havent room to swing round rear up a little and come round on your hind legs. i suppose it comes to the same thing. i can see dicks lance to the right of my right eye and i know im safe. thats what some of our horses do and i dont blame them. as i was saying it wasnt dicks fault. knives are dirty things at any time. i wish i could show you our business. its beautiful. why it took me three years to find out what the men were driving at. always keep hidden as much as possible even if you have to go a mile out of your way. thats scientific and neat. i am not frightened then. well well before id lie down not to speak of sitting down and let a man fire across me my heels and his head would have something to say to each other. they must have been twins. two tails is a great coward. eating is always good. this is fate. none the less two tails is a great coward. that is the proper way to fight. i never heard such stuff. ive heard what you fellows have been saying. but dont be afraid. but its different with me. i know theres a great deal of me to take care of and i know that nobody knows how to cure me when im sick. im not talking to you. but if i were as wise as all that i should never be here. she knew as well as i did that if there is one thing in the world the elephant is more afraid of than another it is a little barking dog. oh why doesnt someone take her away but billys right. it is true that we only see out of our eyes and we are not very clever. but still we are the only people tonight who have not been afraid. youre hung up till daylight. im going to look at this man. besides white men who havent a place to sleep in are more than likely to be thieves and ive a good deal of government property on my back. try to control your feelings wont you if you pass us on the ground tomorrow dont trumpet. i gave a cheer all by myself for billy the mule but he never looked right or left. they had made a big half circle across the plain and were spreading out into a line. up till then he had not shown the shadow of a sign of astonishment or anything else. the old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room then she put them up and looked out under them. no tom. i might a thought of that closet. look at your hands. and look at your mouth. his aunt polly stood surprised a moment and then broke into a gentle laugh. aint he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time but old fools is the biggest fools there is. cant learn an old dog new tricks as the saying is. but my goodness he never plays them alike two days and how is a body to know whats coming i aint doing my duty by that boy and thats the lords truth goodness knows. im a laying up sin and suffering for us both i know. he searched aunt pollys face but it told him nothing. but in spite of her tom knew where the wind lay now. he opened his jacket. but i forgive ye tom. within two minutes or even less he had forgotten all his troubles. it was not dark yet. presently tom checked his whistle. a stranger was before him a boy a shade larger than himself. he had shoes on and it was only friday. neither boy spoke. you think youre some now dont you what do you keep saying you will for why dont you do it presently they were shoulder to shoulder. but neither could get an advantage. tom struck them to the ground. the boy only struggled to free himself. there was a song in every heart and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips. there was cheer in every face and a spring in every step. thirty yards of board fence nine feet high. life to him seemed hollow and existence but a burden. thats the way she always talks. but toms energy did not last. stop her let your outside turn over slow lively now stand by that stage now let her go dont you wish you could well i dont see why i oughtnt to like it. you see aunt pollys awful particular about this fence right here on the street you know but if it was the back fence i wouldnt mind and she wouldnt. now dont you see how im fixed tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world after all. of toms statement true. there was a gate but as a general thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. his soul was at peace now that he had settled with sid for calling attention to his black thread and getting him into trouble. but sids fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and broke. so she kept silence and went about her affairs with a troubled heart. ah how would she feel then then he thought of his flower. he wondered if she would pity him if she knew would she cry and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and comfort him was the sacred presence there and thus she would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning and oh blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. why dont you tell me mary i wouldnt do that. you must go and learn it again. you mustnt be so bad. he now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable. he lost his temper and said he was always being made to do everything he didnt want to do. they were satisfactory and the property changed hands. there that is it. that is the way good little boys and girls should do. i see one little girl who is looking out of the window i am afraid she thinks i am out there somewhere perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds. the lady was leading a child. hes a going up there. say look hes a going to shake hands with him he is shaking hands with him tom most of all she thought. he would have liked to fall down and worship him if it were in the dark. the judge put his hand on toms head and called him a fine little man and asked him what his name was. i thought there was more to it maybe. thats very well. thats a good boy. fine boy. and now you wouldnt mind telling me and this lady some of the things youve learned no i know you wouldnt for we are proud of little boys that learn. he blushed now and his eyes fell. the boys all hated him he was so good. it was a great many years ago and i can scarcely remember anything about it but i think it was in some foreign country. he was regarded as a wonderful reader. and now the minister prayed. tom counted the pages of the sermon after church he always knew how many pages there had been but he seldom knew anything else about the discourse. however this time he was really interested for a little while. the first thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger. the beetle lay there working its helpless legs unable to turn over. his head nodded and little by little his chin descended and touched the enemy who seized it. monday morning always found him so because it began another weeks slow suffering in school. tom lay thinking. presently it occurred to him that he wished he was sick then he could stay home from school. here was a vague possibility. but they soon grew feeble and presently died wholly away. he reflected further. suddenly he discovered something. one of his upper front teeth was loose. nothing offered for some little time and then he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. but sid slept on unconscious. no result from sid. tom itll be over by and by maybe. oh tom dont everything youve ever done to me. dont tom oh dont. tell em so sid. and her face grew white too and her lip trembled. open your mouth. well your tooth is loose but youre not going to die about that. it dont hurt any more. i wish i may never stir if it does. so he played with him every time he got a chance. in a word everything that goes to make life precious that boy had. my hes pretty stiff. is that so theyll all lie. i dont know him. its better. why tom i know she is. and then its sunday. thats so. im satisfied with it. by and by attention ceased from him and the accustomed school murmur rose upon the dull air once more. she thrust it away. tom gently put it back. tom patiently returned it to its place. then she let it remain. the boy worked on apparently unconscious. whats yours oh i know. im tom when im good. but she was not backward this time. she begged to see. then the master stood over him during a few awful moments and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word. the air was utterly dead. there was not a breath stirring. his hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer though he did not know it. this bosom friend was joe harper. this change of base occurred often. at last tom could stand it no longer. joe was angry in a moment. in a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane and when they reached the school they had it all to themselves. ive got some. that will be nice. i dont know. why it aint like anything. you only just tell a boy you wont ever have anybody but him ever ever ever and then you kiss and thats all. but you mustnt ever tell anybody will you tom dont you be afraid of that it aint anything at all. and always after this you know you aint ever to love anybody but me and you aint ever to marry anybody but me ever never and forever. of course. thats part of it. then his pride was up and he strode away and went outside. but she did not. then he began to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. she was still standing back there in the corner sobbing with her face to the wall. he went to her and stood a moment not knowing exactly how to proceed. then tom marched out of the house and over the hills and far away to return to school no more that day. presently becky began to suspect. she had no companions but silence and loneliness. now as to this girl. what had he done nothing. he had meant the best in the world and been treated like a dog like a very dog. she would be sorry some day maybe when it was too late. what if he went away ever so far away into unknown countries beyond the seas and never came back any more how would she feel then he would be a pirate that was it how his name would fill the world and make people shudder he would run away from home and enter upon it. he would start the very next morning. therefore he must now begin to get ready. he soon struck wood that sounded hollow. in it lay a marble. so it was a witch that done it. but it occurred to him that he might as well have the marble he had just thrown away and therefore he went and made a patient search for it. but he could not find it. but it must have fallen short or gone too far so he tried twice more. fall why dont you fall yourself i cant fall that aint the way it is in the book. they said their prayers and sid was soon asleep. tom lay awake and waited in restless impatience. when it seemed to him that it must be nearly daylight he heard the clock strike ten this was despair. so he lay still and stared up into the dark. evidently spirits were abroad. tom was in an agony. the raising of a neighboring window disturbed him. the boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom. it was on a hill about a mile and a half from the village. then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. he must force some talk. but i never meant any harm. there tis again theyre coming sure. i dont believe theyll bother us. we aint doing any harm. three of em they aint going to hurt us. one of em is anyway. he aint sharp enough to notice us. now theyre stuck. cant find it. here they come again. now theyre hot. cold again. hot again. red hot they cast down their load and began to open the grave. he was so close the boys could have touched him. did you think id forget the injun blood aint in me for nothing. his hand closed upon the knife he raised it glanced at it and let it fall with a shudder. his eyes met joes. id no business to drink tonight. tell me how it was joe. i wish i may die this minute if i did. theyll all say that. joe dont tell i always liked you joe and stood up for you too. dont you remember you be off yonder way and ill go this. the stillness was complete again too. he says so his own self. you know that. its the best thing. see next page. dont do that. a pins brass. thats what it is. the boys clasped each other suddenly in an agony of fright. the boys hearts sank once more. i might a been good like sid if id a tried but no i wouldnt of course. but i like a fool never thought. tom pricked up his ears. sounds so anyway. the boys hearts had stood still and their hopes too when the man moved but their fears passed away now. and suppose there aint. when tom crept in at his bedroom window the night was almost spent. when tom awoke sid was dressed and gone. there was a late look in the light a late sense in the atmosphere. he was startled. the family were still at table but they had finished breakfast. his elbow was pressing against some hard substance. after a long time he slowly and sadly changed his position and took up this object with a sigh. it was in a paper. this final feather broke the camels back. it seemed to him an age since he was there before. then both looked elsewhere at once and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their mutual glance. its him look out hes turning this shot seemed to carry home. you said that over and over. tell what its that dreadful murder. i dream about it most every night myself. sid seemed satisfied. he began to find himself hanging around her fathers house nights and feeling very miserable. she was ill. what if she should die his aunt was concerned. this indifference must be broken up at any cost. she ordered a lot at once. she tasted it and was filled with gratitude. aunt polly took it held it up. because if hed had one shed a burnt him out herself it done him good too. he was sick he said and he looked it. he tried to seem to be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking down the road. then one more frock passed in at the gate and toms heart gave a great bound. but she seemed to be unconscious of it all she never looked. could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there he was gloomy and desperate. yes they had forced him to it at last he would lead a life of crime. there was no choice. then they began to lay their plans. there was a small log raft there which they meant to capture. the mighty river lay like an ocean at rest. tom listened a moment but no sound disturbed the quiet. then he gave a low distinct whistle. the terror of the seas had brought a side of bacon and had about worn himself out with getting it there. that was a wise thought matches were hardly known there in that day. stand by to meet her when she comes port port now men with a will the river was not high so there was not more than a two or three mile current. now the raft was passing before the distant town. but theyve got to do it. and the womens always beautiful too. oh no he sat up and rubbed his eyes and looked around. joe and huck still slept. they felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water. they found plenty of things to be delighted with but nothing to be astonished at. they took a swim about every hour so it was close upon the middle of the afternoon when they got back to camp. but the talk soon began to drag and then died. they fell to thinking. but they were all ashamed of their weakness and none was brave enough to speak his thought. the boys started glanced at each other and then each assumed a listening attitude. her broad deck seemed crowded with people. of course they do. this was fine. it was worth while to be a pirate after all. the pirates returned to camp. but when the shadows of night closed them in they gradually ceased to talk and sat gazing into the fire with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. joe followed next. tom lay upon his elbow motionless for some time watching the two intently. however he reached the shore finally and drifted along till he found a low place and drew himself out. tom felt happy in his success for he knew it was the boats last trip for the night. they were by the bed and the bed was between them and the door. tom hurried up. why of course it is. no end of strange things now. godll take care of him never you trouble yourself sir oh mrs. harper i dont know how to give him up i dont know how to give him up but its so hard oh its so hard but hes out of all his troubles now. he could hear mary crying and putting in a kindly word for him from time to time. tom shuddered. his heart was full of pity for her. so he stepped ashore and entered the woods. the night was far spent. he wont desert. he knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate and toms too proud for that sort of thing. hes up to something or other. sometimes they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. he did not venture again until he had found it and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to rest. but he wrote it again nevertheless he could not help it. the tears lay very near the surface. huck was melancholy too. theyve hid treasures here somewhere. i want to go home. baby poor thing does it want to see its mother and so it shall. you like it here dont you huck oh youre a nice pirate. well stay wont we huck let him go if he wants to. toms heart began to sink. he glanced at huck. huck could not bear the look and dropped his eyes. you can all go if you want to. now you think it over. wait after a dainty egg and fish dinner tom said he wanted to learn to smoke now. joe caught at the idea and said he would like to try too. so huck made pipes and filled them. youve heard me talk just that way havent you huck dont you remember huck just let him try it once. i want a smoke. both boys were looking very pale and miserable now. toms followed. you go over that way and ill hunt around by the spring. they were wide apart in the woods both very pale both fast asleep. but something informed him that if they had had any trouble they had got rid of it. about midnight joe awoke and called the boys. they sat still intent and waiting. the solemn hush continued. by and by another came a little stronger. then another. there was a pause. and it showed three white startled faces too. they clung together in terror in the thick gloom that followed. a furious blast roared through the trees making everything sing as it went. now the battle was at its highest. this was to knock off being pirates for a while and be indians for a change. they were not likely to fool away this high promise for lack of effort. the saturday holiday seemed a burden to the children. but she found nothing there to comfort her. oh if it was to do over again i wouldnt say that i wouldnt say it for the whole world. none could remember when the little church had been so full before. there was an unusual amount of talk. sid would have thought. and sid would have come and done it too. so we always do. the wind did blow something. ive got it now didnt i mary well what did i make him do tom i never heard the beat of that in all my days dont tell me there aint anything in dreams any more. well goodness gracious so i did. not the first time neither. there must a been an angel there. tom you couldnt told it more like if youd a seen it and then what a body does just the same in a dream as hed do if he was awake. sid had better judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the house. and indeed it was he tried not to seem to see the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along but they were food and drink to him. glory was sufficient. he would live for glory. presently she arrived. tom pretended not to see her. he moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and began to talk. did you why its funny i didnt see you. he called himself a fool and all the hard names he could think of. he could not help it. you just wait till i catch you out tom fled home at noon. at last she grew entirely miserable and wished she hadnt carried it so far. he wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much risk to himself. here was his opportunity. before she was half way home however she had changed her mind. tom i dont know what is to become of a boy that will act like that. it merely looked mean and shabby now. he hung his head and could not think of anything to say for a moment. i didnt honest. but i dont want to find out its a lie. his mood always determined his manner. so he said nothing. but he was in a fine rage nevertheless. he kept that book under lock and key. now as becky was passing by the desk which stood near the door she noticed that the key was in the lock it was a precious moment. she glanced around found herself alone and the next instant she had the book in her hands. i know something thats going to happen. you just wait and youll see nobodyll answer. girls faces always tell on them. every time he stole a glance at the girls side of the room beckys face troubled him. considering all things he did not want to pity her and yet it was all he could do to help it. becky supposed she would be glad of that and she tried to believe she was glad of it but she found she was not certain. tom shot a glance at becky. instantly he forgot his quarrel with her. quick something must be done done in a flash too good but his resolution shook for one little instant and the chance was lost the master opened the volume. if tom only had the wasted opportunity back again too late. there was no help for becky now he said. the next moment the master faced the school. every eye sank under his gaze. there was silence while one might count ten the master was gathering his wrath. one could have heard a pin drop. another pause. they threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief. but he kept ahead all the time. but enough of this. each new scene is more charming than the last. i love thee well but yet for a while do i leave thee now he knew what the matter was and set himself to right it. he threw his entire attention upon his work now as if determined not to be put down by the mirth. and well it might. that broke up the meeting. during three days tom was deeply concerned about the judges condition and hungry for news of it. tom resolved that he would never trust a man like that again. the funeral was a fine thing. tom was a free boy again however there was something in that. he could drink and swear now but found to his surprise that he did not want to. the simple fact that he could took the desire away and the charm of it. he was very ill he was interested in nothing. the three weeks he spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. poor lads tom could not get away from it. it kept him in a cold shiver all the time. he took huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him. but lets swear again anyway. we couldnt get him out tom. he was on the ground floor and there were no guards. and i dont forget it i dont. well boys i done an awful thing drunk and crazy at the time thats the only way i account for it and now i got to swing for it and its right. right and best too i reckon hope so anyway. well we wont talk about that. but what i want to say is dont you ever get drunk then you wont ever get here. good friendly faces good friendly faces. thats it. huck was having the same experience. tom was out late that night and came to bed through the window. he was in a tremendous state of excitement. it was hours before he got to sleep. a third witness swore he had often seen the knife in potters possession. we have changed our mind. every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon tom as he rose and took his place upon the stand. the boy looked wild enough for he was badly scared. dont be afraid. we will produce him at the proper time. the truth is always respectable. there were some that believed he would be president yet if he escaped hanging. but that sort of conduct is to the worlds credit therefore it is not well to find fault with it. half the time tom was afraid injun joe would never be captured the other half he was afraid he would be. he felt sure he never could draw a safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse. this desire suddenly came upon tom one day. huck would answer. huck was willing. but i mean youd just see em scattered around you know in a kind of a general way. fight why they used to fight all the time. theyll all comb a body. i tell you you better. youll come and live with me. no result. still no result. not generally. the labor dragged a little but still they made progress. but wont the widow take it away from us tom maybe shed like to try it once. whoever finds one of these hid treasures it belongs to him. the work went on. i dont understand it. i didnt think of that. oh i know what the matter is now hang it all we got to come back in the night. its an awful long way. they sat in the shadow waiting. by and by they judged that twelve had come they marked where the shadow fell and began to dig. their hopes commenced to rise. we got to give this one up. it stands to reason. better say we would and friday aint all neither. sure sign of trouble. when they dont fight its only a sign that theres trouble around you know. all we got to do is to look mighty sharp and keep out of it. well drop this thing for today and play. he loved em. they aint any such men now i can tell you. its some kind of a bow of course. on saturday shortly after noon the boys were at the dead tree again. then they crept to the door and took a trembling peep. next they wanted to look upstairs. their courage was up now and well in hand. there... oh my dont whisper another word huck. it was injun joes there was silence for some time. away up the river so and not another house about. they wished in their hearts they had waited a year. wait there till you hear from me. his comrade stirred him once or twice and he became quiet. the boys drew a long grateful breath. at last tom rose slowly and softly and started alone. he never made a second attempt. youre a watchman aint you no use to take it away till we start south. luck the splendor of it was beyond all imagination six hundred dollars was money enough to make half a dozen boys rich here bear a hand and well see what its here for. they were gold. the boys above were as excited as themselves and as delighted. it was not very large it was iron bound and had been very strong before the slow years had injured it. least you dont know all about that thing. no profound distress overhead. id nearly forgot. that pick had fresh earth on it the boys were sick with terror in a moment. what business with fresh earth on them who brought them here and where are they gone have you heard anybody seen anybody what bury it again and leave them to come and see the ground disturbed not exactly not exactly. might have thought of that before. the boys thought of the closet but their strength was gone. if its anybody and theyre up there let them stay there who cares if they want to jump down now and get into trouble who objects it will be dark in fifteen minutes and then let them follow us if they want to. im willing. follow not they. they did not talk much. but for that injun joe never would have suspected. bitter bitter luck that the tools were ever brought there very very small comfort it was to tom to be alone in danger then it occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream he never had supposed for a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in actual money in any ones possession. tom concluded to let huck lead up to the subject. if he did not do it then the adventure would be proved to have been only a dream. somehow i most wish it was. if them stairs hadnt broke down youd a seen how much dream it was find him but i cant make nothing out of it. its too deep. no tom that aint it. he did not care to have hucks company in public places. he was gone half an hour. i reckon thats the very no. the back door of that no. if you see him you just follow him and if he dont go to that no. then there was a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon hucks spirits like a mountain. he began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern it would frighten him but it would at least tell him that tom was alive yet. it seemed hours since tom had disappeared. just as they got within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured down. they wouldnt turn in the lock either. it warnt locked drunk i reckon. i didnt see the box i didnt see the cross. whod a thought such a thing only one bottle alongside of injun joe aint enough. itll begin to be daylight in a couple of hours. but you neednt tell that. no signal came that night. your mother wont know and so whats the harm all she wants is that youll be safe and i bet you shed a said go there if shed a thought of it. presently it occurred to tom that maybe huck might come this very night and give the signal. it was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the sun. but all things have an end. that was an impossible thing. then they were astonished to find that they had been taking no note of time and that night was about at hand. however this sort of close to the days adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. huck waited what seemed a weary long time but nothing happened. was there any use was there really any use why not give it up and turn in a noise fell upon his ear. he was all attention in an instant. he sprang to the corner of the brick store. the next moment two men brushed by him and one seemed to have something under his arm. it must be that box so they were going to remove the treasure. why call tom now it would be absurd the men would get away with the box and never be found again. no he would stick to their wake and follow them he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery. they passed on up the summit. but no footsteps. heavens was everything lost he was about to spring with winged feet when a man cleared his throat not four feet from him he knew where he was. very well he thought let them bury it there it wont be hard to find. his thought was to fly. he wished he dared venture to warn her but he knew he didnt dare they might come and catch him. well there is company there i reckon. give it up and maybe never have another chance. and that aint all. with all the town looking on do you understand he took advantage of me and died. who said anything about killing i would kill him if he was here but not her. you go for her looks. ill tie her to the bed. ill not cry if she does. my friend youll help me in this thing for my sake thats why youre here i mightnt be able alone. do you understand that and company there look here ill get suspicious of you first thing you know. his breath stopped and he listened. there was no sound the stillness was perfect. it aint a name to open many doors i judge huck accompanied them no further. huck waited for no particulars. no they aint dead lad we are sorry enough for that. i tried to keep it back but no use twas bound to come and it did come so did the boys. i judge we never touched them. my boys will be with them presently. that was the way of it last night. that was it. i wouldnt hurt a hair of your head for all the world. no id protect you id protect you. but an injun his eyes were staring wide now and his breath suspended waiting for the answer. but what did give you that turn but youll come out of it. just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. so the news had spread. my three negro men stood guard at your house all the rest of the night. ive got a boy thats turned up missing. i reckon my tom stayed at your house last night one of you. and now hes afraid to come to church. a marked anxiety came into aunt pollys face. the people had stopped moving out of church. all the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. they cried with them too and that was still better than words. she said she would do her best by him because whether he was good bad or indifferent he was the lords and nothing that was the lords was a thing to be neglected. thats the lords mark. he dont leave it off. he never does. no one had heart for anything. and the place has been shut up. ive told you before you must not talk. so the treasure was gone forever gone forever but what could she be crying about curious that she should cry. tom knew their ways and the danger of this sort of conduct. he seized beckys hand and hurried her into the first corridor that offered and none too soon for a bat struck beckys light out with its wing while she was passing out of the cavern. if they put our candles out it will be an awful fix. but i hope we wont get lost. tom shouted. the children stood still and listened but there was no result. tom turned upon the back track at once and hurried his steps. such a fool i never thought we might want to come back no i cant find the way. were lost we never can get out of this awful place tom begged her to pluck up hope again and she said she could not. she said she would try to hope again she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that any more. for he was no more to blame than she she said. byandby tom took beckys candle and blew it out. words were not needed. becky understood and her hope died again. she sat down. tom rested with her and they talked of home and the friends there and the comfortable beds and above all the light tom was grateful. no no i dont tom dont look so a long time after this they could not tell how long tom said they must go softly and listen for dripping water they must find a spring. they found one presently and tom said it was time to rest again. she could not understand it. they sat down and tom fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. thought was soon busy nothing was said for some time. becky almost smiled. byandby becky suggested that they move on again. tom was silent a moment. tom did what he could to comfort her but with little effect. becky was not to have gone home that night the children became silent and thoughtful. how long afterward it was that becky came to a slow consciousness that she was crying in toms arms neither could tell. tom said it might be sunday now maybe monday. tom said that they must have been missed long ago and no doubt the search was going on. he would shout and maybe some one would come. a portion of toms half of the cake was left they divided and ate it. presently he listened again again the sound was heard and apparently a little nearer. they shortly came to one and had to stop. it might be three feet deep it might be a hundred there was no passing it at any rate. tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could. no bottom. a moment or two more and they had gone altogether. now an idea struck him. there were some side passages near at hand. tom lifted up a glorious shout and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to injun joes he was careful to keep from becky what it was he had seen. but becky was very weak. she said she would wait now where she was and die it would not be long. the lost children had not been found. turn out theyre found three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be shaken off at once as tom and becky soon discovered. tom learned of hucks sickness and went to see him on friday but could not be admitted to the bedroom neither could he on saturday or sunday. about a fortnight after toms rescue from the cave he started off to visit huck who had grown plenty strong enough now to hear exciting talk and tom had some that would interest him he thought. tom said he thought he wouldnt mind it. but we have taken care of that. here run somebody tom was touched for he knew by his own experience how this wretch had suffered. the prisoner had searched them out and eaten them. the poor unfortunate had starved to death. no matter. the morning after the funeral tom took huck to a private place to have an important talk. you got into no. if we dont find it ill agree to give you my drum and every thing ive got in the world. well thats one of my marks. all along ive been wanting to be a robber but i knew id got to have a thing like this and where to run across it was the bother. thats the general way. only you dont kill the women. you shut up the women but you dont kill them. theyre always beautiful and rich and awfully scared. they aint anybody as polite as robbers youll see that in any book. well the women get to loving you and after theyve been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that you couldnt get them to leave. if you drove them out theyd turn right around and come back. do you see that it would hang round the money. it had its effect. but thats so. its luck for us that cross is. huck followed. the boys examined three of them with no result. well this comes nearest to being under the cross. huck could suggest nothing. now whats that for i bet you the money is under the rock. he stooped and passed under the narrow way descended gradually. he followed its winding course first to the right then to the left huck at his heels. its just too good to believe but we have got it sure say lets not fool around here. lets snake it out. i noticed that. come along huck weve been in here a long time. its getting late i reckon. im hungry too. as the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got under way. come along with me boys you are keeping everybody waiting. why its not as light as it might be. i dont know about that. mr. jones left the wagon near the door and followed. the widow received the boys as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. nobody suffered half as much as the two boys did however. theyre hucks no no thanks huck mr. jones bought one and i the other. but theyll fit both of you. get into them. i cant stand it. it aint anything. i dont mind it a bit. you cant do any but mean things and you cant bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones. toms chance was come. but the silence was a little awkward. maybe you dont believe it but hes got lots of it. oh you neednt smile i reckon i can show you. all gazed nobody spoke for a moment. it was more than any one present had ever seen at one time before though several persons were there who were worth considerably more than that in property. it was just what the minister got no it was what he was promised he generally couldnt collect it. she went straight off and told tom about it. ive tried it and it dont work it dont work tom. it aint for me i aint used to it. i got to wear shoes all sunday. i aint everybody and i cant stand it. its awful to be tied up so. i never see such a woman and besides that schools going to open and id a had to go to it well i wouldnt stand that tom. yes the way id like a hot stove if i was to set on it long enough. blame it all pretty low characters in it theyd mean you huck. thats good. most of the characters that perform in this book still live and are prosperous and happy. she was such a little girl that one did not expect to see such a look on her small face. it would have been an old look for a child of twelve and sara crewe was only seven. she felt as if she had lived a long long time. captain crewe answered holding her closer and looking down into her face. and though she was only seven years old she knew that he felt sad when he said it. her mother had died when she was born so she had never known or missed her. they had always played together and been fond of each other. she only knew he was rich because she had heard people say so when they thought she was not listening and she had also heard them say that when she grew up she would be rich too. she did not know all that being rich meant. that however was all she knew about it. she had known that she would be obliged to go also and though sometimes her fathers stories of the voyage and the new country had attracted her she had been troubled by the thought that he could not stay with her. she had asked when she was five years old. she had liked to think of that. sometimes she had told them to her father and he had liked them as much as she did. he laughed at her oldfashioned speech and kissed her. then he lifted her out of the cab and they mounted the steps and rang the bell. sara often thought afterward that the house was somehow exactly like miss minchin. inquired sara. and then suddenly he swept her into his arms and kissed her very hard stopping laughing all at once and looking almost as if tears had come into his eyes. it was just then that miss minchin entered the room. she was very like her house sara felt tall and dull and respectable and ugly. it spread itself into a very large smile when she saw sara and captain crewe. among other things she had heard that he was a rich father who was willing to spend a great deal of money on his little daughter. sara stood quietly with her eyes fixed upon miss minchins face. she was thinking something odd as usual. she was thinking. i have short black hair and green eyes besides which i am a thin child and not fair in the least. she was mistaken however in thinking she was an ugly child. i believe i am as ugly as she is in my way. after she had known miss minchin longer she learned why she had said it. she discovered that she said the same thing to each papa and mamma who brought a child to her school. sara stood near her father and listened while he and miss minchin talked. make her ride her pony in the row or go out and buy a new doll. dolls ought to be intimate friends. captain crewe looked at miss minchin and miss minchin looked at captain crewe. she inquired. we are going out together to find her. i have called her emily. she is going to be my friend when papa is gone. she said. sara stayed with her father at his hotel for several days in fact she remained with him until he sailed away again to india. they had passed two or three places without even going in when as they were approaching a shop which was really not a very large one sara suddenly started and clutched her fathers arm. she cried. she said. perhaps she had known her. she had certainly a very intelligent expression in her eyes when sara took her in her arms. he got out of his bed in the middle of that night and went and stood looking down at sara who lay asleep with emily in her arms. emily looked so like a real child that captain crewe felt glad she was there. the next day he took her to miss minchins and left her there. he was to sail away the next morning. he would write to sara twice a week and she was to be given every pleasure she asked for. then he went with sara into her little sitting room and they bade each other goodby. and they put their arms round each other and kissed as if they would never let each other go. when the cab drove away from the door sara was sitting on the floor of her sitting room with her hands under her chin and her eyes following it until it had turned the corner of the square. emily was sitting by her and she looked after it too. when miss minchin sent her sister miss amelia to see what the child was doing she found she could not open the door. she went downstairs again looking almost alarmed. you have seen some of her clothes. i heard miss minchin say to miss amelia that her clothes were so grand that they were ridiculous for a child. my mamma says that children should be dressed simply. my mamma says that even big feet can be made to look small if you have a clever shoemaker. i dont think she is pretty at all. sara was sitting quietly in her seat waiting to be told what to do. she had been placed near miss minchins desk. she was interested and looked back quietly at the children who looked at her. she wondered what they were thinking of and if they liked miss minchin and if they cared for their lessons and if any of them had a papa at all like her own. she had had a long talk with emily about her papa that morning. emily look at me. perhaps really emily can read and talk and walk but she will only do it when people are out of the room. that is her secret. you see if people knew that dolls could do things they would make them work. so perhaps they have promised each other to keep it a secret. if you stay in the room emily will just sit there and stare but if you go out she will begin to read perhaps or go and look out of the window. but she had already begun to like this odd little girl who had such an intelligent small face and such perfect manners. she had taken care of children before who were not so polite. indeed she was very much pleased with her new little mistress and liked her place greatly. all the little girls rose in their places and sara rose also. she had taken a book from the desk and was turning over its leaves. sara went to her politely. sara felt a little awkward. the truth was that sara could not remember the time when she had not seemed to know french. her father had often spoken it to her when she had been a baby. her mother had been a french woman and captain crewe had loved her language so it happened that sara had always heard and been familiar with it. saras cheeks felt warm. she went back to her seat and opened the book. she looked at the first page with a grave face. she knew it would be rude to smile and she was very determined not to be rude. he said to miss minchin. little sara rose in her seat. she was beginning to feel rather desperate as if she were almost in disgrace. she knew that he would understand as soon as she spoke. madame had not understood. she had not learned french exactly not out of books but her papa and other people had always spoken it to her and she had read it and written it as she had read and written english. her papa loved it and she loved it because he did. her dear mamma who had died when she was born had been french. but he spoke to miss minchin. she has not learned french she is french. miss minchin knew she had tried and that it had not been her fault that she was not allowed to explain. she exclaimed severely. take your ribbon out of your mouth so she took rather a fancy to fat slow little miss st. john and kept glancing toward her through the morning. she saw that lessons were no easy matter to her and that there was no danger of her ever being spoiled by being treated as a show pupil. but sara did not laugh. she only said the kind of thing little girls always say to each other by way of beginning an acquaintance but there was something friendly about sara and people always felt it. she said. fluttered ermengarde. miss st. johns chief trouble in life was that she had a clever father. ermengarde was a severe trial to mr. st. john. she learned things and forgot them or if she remembered them she did not understand them. so it was natural that having made saras acquaintance she should sit and stare at her with profound admiration. she said respectfully. inquired sara curiously. i cant say the words. she reflected a few moments. she inquired. ermengarde asked just as miss minchin had done. they had reached the passage leading to saras room by this time and ermengarde stopped short staring and quite losing her breath. she gasped. sara looked at her in simple surprise. they made not the least noise until they reached the door. then sara suddenly turned the handle and threw it wide open. sara explained. ermengarde looked from her to the doll and back again. at least i pretend i believe she can. and that makes it seem as if it were true. its so easy that when you begin you cant stop. you just go on and on doing it always. and its beautiful. emily you must listen. this is ermengarde st.
john emily. ermengarde this is emily. said ermengarde. and emily was put into her arms. a cloud seemed to pass over it and put out the light in her shining eyes. she drew her breath in so sharply that it made a funny sad little sound and then she shut her lips and held them tightly closed as if she was determined either to do or not to do something. ermengarde had an idea that if she had been like any other little girl she might have suddenly burst out sobbing and crying. but she did not. ermengarde ventured. ermengardes mouth fell open a little. but she did not. her short black locks tumbled about her ears and she sat still. then she spoke without lifting her head. you have to bear things. think what soldiers bear papa is a soldier. she was so wonderful and different from anyone else. presently she lifted her face and shook back her black locks with a queer little smile. ermengarde did not know why a lump came into her throat and her eyes felt as if tears were in them. would you have me for yours yes. we will be friends. she knew quite well that if sara wrote to her papa to tell him she was uncomfortable or unhappy captain crewe would remove her at once. miss minchins opinion was that if a child were continually praised and never forbidden to do what she liked she would be sure to be fond of the place where she was so treated. but the clever little brain told her a great many sensible and true things about herself and her circumstances and now and then she talked these things over to ermengarde as time went on. it just happened that i always liked lessons and books and could remember things when i learned them. it just happened that i was born with a father who was beautiful and nice and clever and could give me everything i liked. until the new pupils arrival she had felt herself the leader in the school. she had led because she was capable of making herself extremely disagreeable if the others did not follow her. this at the beginning had been bitter enough but as time went on it became apparent that sara was a leader too and not because she could make herself disagreeable but because she never did. i believe i couldnt help being just a little if i had so many fine things and was made such a fuss over. and theres nothing so clever in her knowing it. she says herself she didnt learn it at all. she just picked it up because she always heard her papa speak it. he killed the one in the skin sara has in her room. thats why she likes it so. no one had seen such a very real dolls tea set before. so it became her habit to make great use of this knowledge. she almost yelled. screamed miss amelia. dont cry oh oh oh miss amelia began to cry. when miss minchin came out and saw her she looked rather annoyed. she realized that her voice as heard from inside the room could not have sounded either dignified or amiable. and she left her. poor plump miss amelia was trying first one method and then another. poor little angel there  sara went to them quietly. she gasped. but she crept out of the room and was very much relieved to find an excuse for doing it. sara stood by the howling furious child for a few moments and looked down at her without saying anything. then she sat down flat on the floor beside her and waited. and it was only another little girl. but it was the one who owned emily and all the nice things. and she was looking at her steadily and as if she was merely thinking. she announced but her voice was not so strong. sara looked at her still more steadily but with a sort of understanding in her eyes. a new idea will stop a crying child when nothing else will. sara paused a moment. because she had been told that her mamma was in heaven she had thought a great deal about the matter and her thoughts had not been quite like those of other people. so does yours. perhaps they can both see us now. sara went on talking. perhaps some people might think that what she said was rather like a fairy story but it was all so real to her own imagination that lottie began to listen in spite of herself. but sara seemed to be telling a real story about a lovely country where real people were. and the streets are shining. and people are never tired however far they walk. she dragged herself close to sara and drank in every word until the end came far too soon. sara saw the danger signal and came out of her dream. she said. and from that time sara was an adopted mother. it seems more real than you are more real than the schoolroom. i feel as if i were all the people in the story one after the other. she was evidently afraid to look at the children or seem to be listening. but sara saw in two minutes that she was deeply interested in what was going on and that she was doing her work slowly in the hope of catching a word here and there. said sara looking odd. said sara in her stern little voice. sometimes she had a rather stern little voice. how do you know mine are fairy stories and she marched out of the room rather hoping that she might see the little servant again somewhere but she found no trace of her when she got into the hall. she was so timid that if one chanced to speak to her it appeared as if her poor frightened eyes would jump out of her head. her name was becky. she thought she looked as if she had never had quite enough to eat. her very eyes were hungry. she hoped she should see her again but though she caught sight of her carrying things up or down stairs on several occasions she always seemed in such a hurry and so afraid of being seen that it was impossible to speak to her. there were a great many of them and she had been running about all day. saras rooms she had saved until the last. they were not like the other rooms which were plain and bare. but she did not look poor becky like a sleeping beauty at all. sara seemed as much unlike her as if she were a creature from another world. when she entered the room she floated in with a few of the butterfly steps and there sat becky nodding her cap sideways off her head. cried sara softly when she saw her. to tell the truth she was quite glad to find it there. she crept toward her quietly and stood looking at her. but miss minchin would be cross if she found out. miss amelia might come in at any moment and if she did becky would be sure to be scolded. a piece of flaming coal ended her perplexity for her that very moment. she did not know she had fallen asleep. she sprang up and clutched at her cap. oh she had got herself into trouble now with a vengeance she would be turned out of doors without wages. sara jumped down and came quite close to her. sara broke into a friendly little laugh and put her hand on her shoulder. how poor becky stared at her in fact she had never heard such a nice friendly sound in anyones voice before. she gasped. one of her queer thoughts rushed into her mind. she put her hand against beckys cheek. becky did not understand in the least. but the next she spoke in a different tone. she realized that becky did not know what she meant. she asked. becky lost her breath again. sara ran to the door opened it and looked out and listened. and she asked it almost in a whisper. an there was one everyone stared at most. i dont know why it is. becky lost her breath again. she cried. sara nodded. she had an extra piece of cake in her pocket and she had been fed and warmed but not only by cake and fire. something else had warmed and fed her and the something else was sara. things like this. not only sara but the entire school found it exciting and made it the chief subject of conversation for weeks after it occurred. in one of his letters captain crewe told a most interesting story. this at least was what sara gathered from his letters. she plays it all the time even in school. she says it makes her learn her lessons better. lessons for the day were over and they were sitting before the schoolroom fire enjoying the time they liked best. it was the time when miss minchin and miss amelia were taking their tea in the sitting room sacred to themselves. even as lavinia spoke the door opened and sara entered with lottie whose habit was to trot everywhere after her like a little dog. exclaimed lavinia in a whisper. she joined a group of little ones who were playing in a corner. she was so far away from the schoolroom that it was not agreeable to be dragged back suddenly by a howl from lottie. never did she find anything so difficult as to keep herself from losing her temper when she was suddenly disturbed while absorbed in a book. lavinia commanded. sara flew across the room and kneeling down put her arms round her. sara patted her but spoke in the steady voice lottie knew. lottie remembered that she had promised but she preferred to lift up her voice. dont you know that sara is your mamma broke out lavinia. sara got up quickly on her feet. it must be remembered that she had been very deeply absorbed in the book about the bastille and she had had to recall several things rapidly when she realized that she must go and take care of her adopted child. she was not an angel and she was not fond of lavinia. here was lavinias opportunity. at least one of us is. sara started toward her. she looked as if she were going to box her ears. perhaps she was. her trick of pretending things was the joy of her life. she never spoke of it to girls she was not fond of. she only just saved herself. her hand dropped and she stood quite still a moment. when she spoke it was in a quiet steady voice she held her head up and everybody listened to her. lavinia could not think of exactly the right thing to say. exclaimed sara in horror. said sara. when she drove or walked out she used to look into shop windows eagerly. the first time it occurred to her to bring home two or three little meat pies she felt that she had hit upon a discovery. she murmured. in fact the mere seeing of miss sara would have been enough without meat pies. he does not really understand them and all this seems so enormous. he had made wonderful preparations for her birthday. this will be my last doll. there is something solemn about it. but i cannot write poetry. i have tried and it made me laugh. no one could ever take emilys place but i should respect the last doll very much and i am sure the school would love it. god grant this business may right itself and leave me free to run home and see her. what wouldnt i give to have her little arms round my neck this minute the boxes containing the presents were to be opened with great ceremony and there was to be a glittering feast spread in miss minchins sacred room. how the morning passed nobody quite knew because there seemed such preparations to be made. she knew it was a present and she thought she could guess whom it came from. she opened it quite tenderly. cried sara with a warm feeling in her heart. sara turned it over and over. and just at that very moment she heard the door being cautiously pushed open and saw becky peeping round it. she said. cried sara. she could not have told herself or anyone else why there was a lump in her throat. breathed becky. sara would have much preferred to enter in the usual way but miss minchin had sent for her and after an interview in her private sitting room had expressed her wishes. said miss minchin at the murmur which arose. suddenly and severely. becky stepped aside respectfully to allow the superior servants to pass out first. it was a bold thing to do. miss minchin was betrayed into something like a slight jump. she exclaimed. sara advanced a step toward her. she glanced from one figure to the other. it really had not occurred to her to think of them in that light. im that grateful miss i did want to see the doll miss that i did. thank you miss. miss minchin waved her hand again this time it was in the direction of the corner near the door. sara felt rather uncomfortable. as this was her party it was probable that the speech was about her. it is not agreeable to stand in a schoolroom and have a speech made about you. murmured lavinia. sara has become my most accomplished pupil. her manners which have caused you to call her princess sara are perfect. the entire schoolroom rose to its feet as it had done the morning sara remembered so well. it said and it must be confessed that lottie jumped up and down. sara looked rather shy for a moment. the instant she had swept out of the room the spell her presence always had upon them was broken. the door had scarcely closed before every seat was empty. there was a rush toward the boxes. sara had bent over one of them with a delighted face. she exclaimed. she sat down upon the floor and turned the key. there is nothing so nice as supposing. its almost like being a fairy. she often thought afterward how strange it was that just as she had finished saying this just at that very moment miss amelia came into the room. she sat down with stiff dignity and waved him to a chair. his attention seemed attracted by the last doll and the things which surrounded her. the last doll herself did not seem to mind this in the least. miss minchin felt offended. he broke out. miss minchin actually got up from her chair. she cried. she cried out. miss minchin dropped into her chair again. the words he had spoken filled her with alarm. she said. miss minchin lost her breath. she gasped out. that young man had too much money. the dear friend was mad on the subject of the diamond mine. he put all his own money into it and all captain crewes. the shock was too much for him. now miss minchin understood and never had she received such a blow in her life. that sara will have no fortune that the child is a beggar miss minchin started forward. she said. miss minchin turned back from the door in increased indignation. this was worse than anyone could have dreamed of its being. she cried. the child was to have anything she wanted. no one will remember you. demanded miss minchin as if she felt it entirely his duty to make the matter right. miss minchin became quite white with rage. he was a clever business man and he knew what he was saying. exclaimed miss minchin. what he had said was quite true. she knew it. she could at least stop this. but as she started toward the door it was opened by miss amelia who when she caught sight of the changed angry face fell back a step in alarm. miss amelia was bewildered. miss amelia began to turn pale. she said. miss minchin wasted no words. miss amelia sat down quite heavily in the nearest chair. and i shall never see a penny of it. put a stop to this ridiculous party of hers. was the fierce answer. poor miss amelia was accustomed to being called a goose. she knew in fact that she was rather a goose and that it was left to geese to do a great many disagreeable things. but the thing must be done. this was evidently not the time when questions might be asked. she rubbed her eyes with her handkerchief until they looked quite red. miss minchin walked across the room. she spoke to herself aloud without knowing that she was doing it. she said. she exclaimed angrily. she cried out. suddenly it seemed almost as if she lost all fear of the awful lady before her. she burst into fresh tears. ordered miss minchin. id do em that quick if youd let me wait on her now shes poor. somehow she made miss minchin feel more angry than ever. she actually stamped her foot. becky threw her apron over her head and fled. even by that time it seemed to sara as if the birthday party had either been a dream or a thing which had happened years ago and had happened in the life of quite another little girl. miss minchins sitting room looked as it always did all traces of the feast were gone and miss minchin had resumed her usual dress. she has actually made no fuss at all. you remember she made none when captain crewe went back to india. when i told her what had happened she just stood quite still and looked at me without making a sound. her eyes seemed to get bigger and bigger and she went quite pale. when i had finished she still stood staring for a few seconds and then her chin began to shake and she turned round and ran out of the room and upstairs. several of the other children began to cry but she did not seem to hear them or to be alive to anything but just what i was saying. nobody but sara herself ever knew what had happened in her room after she had run upstairs and locked her door. do you hear do you hear papa is dead she is all i have. she had always made miss minchin feel secretly uncomfortable and she did so now. sara kept her big strange eyes fixed on her and said not a word. he left me no money. demanded miss minchin sharply. sara turned her head toward the chair. said miss minchin. if she had cried and sobbed and seemed frightened miss minchin might almost have had more patience with her. you are not a princess any longer. to her surprise a faint gleam of light came into the childs eyes a shade of relief. she said. if you make yourself useful i may let you stay here. exclaimed sara. i know i can teach them. if you dont please me you will be sent away. remember that. sara stood still just a moment looking at her. in her young soul she was thinking deep and strange things. then she turned to leave the room. said miss minchin. she said. sara made two or three steps toward her. she went up the stairs slowly but panting for breath and she held emily tightly against her side. but just before she reached the landing miss amelia came out of the door and closed it behind her and stood before it looking nervous and awkward. the truth was that she felt secretly ashamed of the thing she had been ordered to do. exclaimed sara and she fell back a pace. somehow all at once sara understood. she realized that this was the beginning of the change miss minchin had spoken of. she asked hoping very much that her voice did not shake. sara knew where it was. becky had told her about it. she felt as if she were walking away and leaving far behind her the world in which that other child who no longer seemed herself had lived. this child in her short tight old frock climbing the stairs to the attic was quite a different creature. then she shut the door and stood against it and looked about her. yes this was another world. some pieces of furniture too much worn to be used downstairs had been sent up. sara went to it and sat down. she seldom cried. she did not cry now. sara lifted her head and looked at her. she tried to begin a smile and somehow she could not. you see how true it is. theres no difference now. there was no one who would have understood. it was perhaps well for her that she was reminded by her small body of material things. if this had not been so the anguish of her young mind might have been too great for a child to bear. but really while the night was passing she scarcely knew that she had a body at all or remembered any other thing than one. she kept whispering to herself. then there was something worse. she knew what they meant because becky had described them. they meant rats and mice who were either fighting with each other or playing together. the change in her life did not come about gradually but was made all at once. the glimpse sara caught of her sitting room as she passed its open door showed her that everything had been changed. you must keep them quiet and see that they behave well and do not waste their food. you ought to have been down earlier. that was the beginning and from day to day the duties given to her were added to. she could be told to do things other people neglected. her own lessons became things of the past. one of the most curious things in her new existence was her changed position among the pupils. it is better that she should live a separate life one suited to her circumstances. sara did not expect much and was far too proud to try to continue to be intimate with girls who evidently felt rather awkward and uncertain about her. i like to know about them. but there were hours when her child heart might almost have broken with loneliness but for three people. the first it must be owned was becky just becky. and during the nights that followed the sense of comfort grew. they had little chance to speak to each other during the day. beckys heart told her that it was best that people in trouble should be left alone. the two had always been friends but sara had felt as if she were years the older. she was in fact not a person one would remember when one was caught in the storm of a great trouble and sara forgot her. it had been all the easier to forget her because she had been suddenly called home for a few weeks. when she came back she did not see sara for a day or two and when she met her for the first time she encountered her coming down a corridor with her arms full of garments which were to be taken downstairs to be mended. sara herself had already been taught to mend them. ermengarde was too slow a girl to be equal to such a situation. she could not think of anything to say. she knew what had happened but somehow she had never imagined sara could look like this so odd and poor and almost like a servant. she held the pile of garments in her arms and her chin rested upon the top of it to keep it steady. she felt as if sara had changed into a new kind of girl and she had never known her before. perhaps it was because she had suddenly grown poor and had to mend things and work like becky. she said in a rush. she said. and she marched past her without another word. she was always awkward and the more she felt the more stupid she was given to being. miss minchin made it so easy that at last they scarcely saw each other at all. once jessie who was passing stopped to look at her curiously. she asked. and she turned her plump back and took out her handkerchief and boldly hid her face in it. that night when sara went to her attic she was later than usual. she had been kept at work until after the hour at which the pupils went to bed and after that she had gone to her lessons in the lonely schoolroom. it was ermengarde. cried sara. she was so startled that she was almost frightened. her eyes and nose were pink with crying. she said. oh sara please tell me. what is the matter something in her voice made the familiar lump rise in saras throat. it sounded as if she had not meant what she had seemed to mean during these past weeks. ermengarde opened her wet eyes wide. she cried. i didnt know what to do. sara thought a moment. she saw she had made a mistake. miss minchin does not want me to talk to the girls. most of them dont want to talk to me. i thought perhaps you didnt. and then after one more look they rushed into each others arms. it must be confessed that saras small black head lay for some minutes on the shoulder covered by the red shawl. i was nearly dead. i was afraid they would. sara looked round also. she spoke slowly. her imagination was beginning to work for her. it had not worked for her at all since her troubles had come upon her. no one but sara could have done it. i am a prisoner in the bastille. i have been here for years and years and years and everybody has forgotten about me. she turned to ermengarde looking quite like the old sara. she said. there had been much whispering among the little ones when it had been discovered that sara no longer lived in the rooms in which emily had so long sat in state. lotties chief difficulty was that sara said so little when one asked her questions. she looked as if she was going to cry. inquired lottie. but lottie was a determined little person. if sara would not tell her where she lived she would find out in some other way. there she found two doors near each other and opening one she saw her beloved sara standing upon an old table and looking out of a window. sara turned round at the sound of her voice. what would happen now if lottie began to cry and any one chanced to hear they were both lost. she jumped down from her table and ran to the child. gasped lottie and as she looked round it she bit her lip. then somehow it was quite possible that any place in which sara lived might turn out to be nice. she almost whispered. there was a sort of comfort in the warmth of the plump childish body. she had had a hard day and had been staring out of the windows with hot eyes. cried lottie. sara lifted her up and they stood on the old table together and leaned on the edge of the flat window in the roof and looked out. anyone who has not done this does not know what a different world they saw. the garret window next to theirs was shut because the house next door was empty. the sky seemed so much nearer than when one saw it from the street that lottie was enchanted. one scarcely believed in the existence of miss minchin and miss amelia and the schoolroom and the roll of wheels in the square seemed a sound belonging to another existence. lottie could scarcely keep still. she whispered. yes he will lottie was so delighted that she quite forgot her first shocked impression of the attic. see you can scarcely stand up at this end of the room and when the morning begins to come i can lie in bed and look right up into the sky through that flat window in the roof. it takes such a lot. if it was polished and there was a fire in it just think how nice it would be. she quite made lottie see them too. lottie could always believe in the things sara made pictures of. it could be beautiful. cried lottie. when sara had persuaded her to go downstairs again and after setting her on her way had come back to her attic she stood in the middle of it and looked about her. she sat down on it for a few minutes and let her head drop in her hands. the mere fact that lottie had come and gone away again made things seem a little worse just as perhaps prisoners feel a little more desolate after visitors come and go leaving them behind. she was sitting in this way when her attention was attracted by a slight sound near her. some of lotties crumbs had dropped upon the floor and their scent had drawn him out of his hole. he looked at her with his bright eyes as if he were asking a question. the moment they saw me. its so different to be a sparrow. but nobody asked this rat if he wanted to be a rat when he was made. she had sat so quietly that the rat had begun to take courage. he was very hungry. he had left the children crying bitterly and felt he would risk a good deal for a few crumbs so he cautiously dropped upon his feet. you can have them poor thing prisoners in the bastille used to make friends with rats. how it is that animals understand things i do not know but it is certain that they do understand. perhaps there is a soul hidden in everything and it can always speak without even making a sound to another soul. but whatsoever was the reason the rat knew from that moment that he was safe even though he was a rat. he was really a very nice rat and did not mean the least harm. when the mysterious thing which speaks without saying any words told him that she would not he went softly toward the crumbs and began to eat them. she sat and watched him without making any movement. she scarcely allowed herself to breathe she was so deeply interested. there was indeed such a silence in the room at first that ermengarde wondered if she could have fallen asleep. ermengarde heard her say. almost immediately sara opened the door and when she did so she found ermengarde standing with alarmed eyes upon the threshold. she gasped out. sara drew her in cautiously but she looked as if something pleased and amused her. ermengarde felt almost inclined to scream on the spot but managed to control herself. she looked all round the attic and saw no one. and yet sara had certainly been speaking to someone. she thought of ghosts. she did not scream but she gasped with fright. she cried under her breath. i am making him tame. he actually knows me and comes out when i call him. she said. he is just like a person. she did it several times looking entirely absorbed in it. ermengarde thought she looked as if she were working a spell. sara had some crumbs in her hand. he is very nice. he only eats the little bits. ermengarde began to laugh. she said. she rubbed her forehead with her little brown paw and a puzzled tender look came into her face. he thought i was queer but he liked me to make up things. i i cant help making up things. she paused and glanced around the attic. ermengarde was interested as she always was. how do we know he doesnt think things just as we do his eyes look as if he was a person. she sat down on the floor in her favorite attitude holding her knees. asked ermengarde eagerly. just at that moment ermengarde almost jumped off the bed she was so startled by a sound she heard. she exclaimed. she knocked three times on the wall herself as if in answer. she whispered joyfully. you are a story i am a story. so their visits were rare ones and sara lived a strange and lonely life. all her valuable garments had been disposed of and such as had been left for her use she was expected to wear so long as she could put them on at all. there were several families in the square in which miss minchin lived with which she had become quite familiar in a way of her own. the one she liked best she called the large family. she called it the large family not because the members of it were big for indeed most of them were little but because there were so many of them. there were eight children in the large family and a stout rosy mother and a stout rosy father and a stout rosy grandmother and any number of servants. sara was quite fond of them and had given them names out of books quite romantic names. one evening a very funny thing happened though perhaps in one sense it was not a funny thing at all. he was such a pretty fellow and had such rosy cheeks and blue eyes and such a darling little round head covered with curls that sara forgot her basket and shabby cloak altogether in fact forgot everything but that she wanted to look at him for a moment. so she paused and looked. guy clarence had been affected to tears that very afternoon by the reading of such a story and he had burned with a desire to find such a poor child and give her a certain sixpence he possessed and thus provide for her for life. he thought that her eyes looked hungry because she had perhaps had nothing to eat for a long time. he only knew that she had big eyes and a thin face and thin legs and a common basket and poor clothes. her face went red and then it went pale and for a second she felt as if she could not take the dear little sixpence. she said. he thrust the sixpence into her hand. to be as proud as that would be a cruel thing. so she actually put her pride in her pocket though it must be admitted her cheeks burned. and as he scrambled joyfully into the carriage she went away trying to smile though she caught her breath quickly and her eyes were shining through a mist. she had known that she looked odd and shabby but until now she had not known that she might be taken for a beggar. as the large familys carriage drove away the children inside it were talking with interested excitement. sara managed to bore a hole in the sixpence and hung it on an old bit of narrow ribbon round her neck. her affection for the large family increased as indeed her affection for everything she could love increased. she used to talk to him and somehow he looked quite as if he understood. there had grown in her mind rather a strange feeling about emily who always sat and looked on at everything. she did not like to own to herself that her only companion could feel and hear nothing. but she never did. i never answer when i can help it. miss minchin turns pale with rage when i do it miss amelia looks frightened and so do the girls. when you will not fly into a passion people know you are stronger than they are because you are strong enough to hold in your rage and they are not and they say stupid things they wish they hadnt said afterward. theres nothing so strong as rage except what makes you hold it in thats stronger. its a good thing not to answer your enemies. i scarcely ever do. perhaps emily is more like me than i am like myself. perhaps she would rather not answer her friends even. there was nobody but emily no one in the world. and there she sat. emily simply stared. im cold im wet im starving to death. and because i could not find that last thing the cook sent me for they would not give me any supper. some men laughed at me because my old shoes made me slip down in the mud. im covered with mud now. and they laughed. she lifted her little savage hand and knocked emily off the chair bursting into a passion of sobbing sara who never cried. she cried. you care for nothing. you never had a heart. nothing could ever make you feel. sara hid her face in her arms. it was so unlike her to break down that she was surprised at herself. sara bent and picked her up. she even smiled at herself a very little smile. we are not all made alike. and she kissed her and shook her clothes straight and put her back upon her chair. she had wished very much that some one would take the empty house next door. she wished it because of the attic window which was so near hers. she said. she had an idea that if she could see some of the furniture she could guess something about the people it belonged to. i told papa afterward and he laughed and said it was true. several pieces of furniture had been set out of the van upon the pavement. she had seen things so like them in india. all the things look rather grand. several times it so happened that sara had an opportunity of seeing things carried in. i am glad. he ran up them as if he felt quite at home and expected to run up and down them many a time in the future. at night after her work was done becky came in to see her fellow prisoner and bring her news. hes very rich an hes ill an the gentleman of the large family is his lawyer. hes had a lot of trouble an its made him ill an low in his mind. sara laughed a little. it sounded so much more romantic than that he should merely be the ordinary kind of gentleman who went to church with a prayer book. she sat and talked long that night of what he would be like of what his wife would be like if he had one and of what his children would be like if they had children. a carriage drove up one day and stopped before the house. he was carried up the steps and the head of the large family went with him looking very anxious. shortly afterward a doctors carriage arrived and the doctor went in plainly to take care of him. that was the beginning of the story of the indian gentleman. when she had accomplished this she always drew a long breath and looked all round her. it used to seem as if she had all the sky and the world to herself. there was such a sunset as this a few days after the indian gentleman was brought to his new home and as it fortunately happened that the afternoons work was done in the kitchen and nobody had ordered her to go anywhere or perform any task sara found it easier than usual to slip away and go upstairs. she mounted her table and stood looking out. it was a wonderful moment. a deep rich yellow light filled the air the birds flying across the tops of the houses showed quite black against it. she suddenly turned her head because she heard a sound a few yards away from her. it came from the window of the next attic. someone had come to look at the sunset as she had. as sara looked toward him he looked toward her. she felt absolutely sure he had come up to look at the sun because he had seen it so seldom in england that he longed for a sight of it. hers was evidently a pleasure to him. that would not do at all. perhaps he belonged to the indian gentleman and the poor man was fond of him. she could make the man understand. she spoke to him in the language he knew. she asked. she thought she had never seen more surprise and delight than the dark face expressed when she spoke in the familiar tongue. the monkey was a good monkey and would not bite but unfortunately he was difficult to catch. ram dass knew him as if he were his child and ram dass he would sometimes obey but not always. but he was evidently afraid sara might think he was taking a great liberty and perhaps would not let him come. but sara gave him leave at once. she inquired. the monkey saw him and uttered a little scream. it was not a very long chase. he would have been made sad if his favorite had run away and been lost. when he had gone sara stood in the middle of her attic and thought of many things his face and his manner had brought back to her. it was like a sort of dream. it was all over and it could never come back. it certainly seemed that there was no way in which any change could take place. she knew what miss minchin intended that her future should be. so long as she was too young to be used as a regular teacher she would be used as an errand girl and servant and yet expected to remember what she had learned and in some mysterious way to learn more. she might be trusted to be equal to teaching a good deal in the course of a few years. that was all there seemed to be to look forward to and sara stood quite still for several minutes and thought it over. it would be easy to be a princess if i were dressed in cloth of gold but it is a great deal more of a triumph to be one all the time when no one knows it. she was a great deal more like a queen then than when she was so gay and everything was so grand. i like her best then. this was not a new thought but quite an old one by this time. the morning after the interview with ram dass and his monkey sara was in the schoolroom with her small pupils. how frightened she must have been when she found out what she had done. if miss minchin should find out that she sara whose toes were almost sticking out of her boots was a princess a real one it made sara start. then not knowing she was going to do it she broke into a little laugh. miss minchin exclaimed. it took sara a few seconds to control herself sufficiently to remember that she was a princess. sara hesitated a second before she replied. demanded miss minchin. all the girls looked up from their books to listen. really it always interested them a little when miss minchin attacked sara. sara always said something queer and never seemed the least bit frightened. miss minchin fairly gasped. and i was thinking that if i were one you would never dare to do it whatever i said or did. she exclaimed. lavinia leaned forward on her seat to look. leave the schoolroom sara made a little bow. jessie broke out. she knew that the schoolroom was next to the indian gentlemans study and she hoped that the wall was thick so that the noise made sometimes after lesson hours would not disturb him. i have adopted him for a friend. you can do that with people you never speak to at all. you can just watch them and think about them and be sorry for them until they seem almost like relations. i dont like those i have. you are very fat. sara laughed. she had become fond of the large family because they looked happy but she had become fond of the indian gentleman because he looked unhappy. he had evidently not fully recovered from some very severe illness. his trouble and peril had been connected with mines. said the cook. so her heart was more drawn to him than before. when she was sent out at night she used sometimes to feel quite glad because there was always a chance that the curtains of the house next door might not yet be closed and she could look into the warm room and see her adopted friend. perhaps you feel a little warm and comforted and dont know why when i am standing here in the cold and hoping you will get well and happy again. good night good night. he looked to sara like a man who had a trouble on his mind still not merely like one whose troubles lay all in the past. he had in fact a very tender place in his heart for all children and particularly for little girls. they were very fond of ram dass. he was very much interested and all the more so when he heard from ram dass of the adventure of the monkey on the roof. he knew that the worst thing the man could do for himself for his reason and his health was to begin to think in the particular way of this particular subject. they adopted her because she had been the favorite companion of their little daughter who died. we are not sure. the circumstances were curiously similar. mr. carmichael paused a moment as if a new thought had occurred to him. i never saw either the child or her mother. ralph crewe and i loved each other as boys but we had not met since our school days until we met in india. i was absorbed in the magnificent promise of the mines. he became absorbed too. the whole thing was so huge and glittering that we half lost our heads. when we met we scarcely spoke of anything else. i only knew that the child had been sent to school somewhere. he was beginning to be excited. mr. carmichael watched him anxiously. the indian gentleman leaned forward and struck the table with a long wasted hand. if she is alive she is somewhere. poor crewe had put into the scheme every penny that he owned. he trusted me he loved me. if you had not been you would have stayed and fought it out. i had not slept for weeks. and i seemed to remember nothing. i did not remember the child for months and months. he stopped a moment and rubbed his forehead. but the wretched mines drove everything else out of our heads. we talked of nothing else. if he spoke of the school i forgot i forgot. she seemed to have a vague idea that they lived in moscow. and when i look into it i seem to see crewes gay young face gazing back at me. he looks as if he were asking me a question. mr. carmichael answered him in a rather low voice. he caught at carmichaels hand and clung to it. he said. but you have to bite your tongue to hold yourself in. i bit mine. quite suddenly she put her black head down in her arms as she often did when she was alone. this was what happened that day on both sides of the wall. but the attic was dismal beyond words. if it was necessary to go to her attic for anything sara was obliged to light a candle. becky was driven like a little slave. that there does seem real now doesnt it i can jest see them big keys you say she carries. when things are horrible just horrible i think as hard as ever i can of being a princess. i say to myself i am a princess and i am a fairy one and because i am a fairy nothing can hurt me or make me uncomfortable. but she did not know that. she hurried on trying to make her mind think of something else. it was really very necessary. but really this time it was harder than she had ever found it and once or twice she thought it almost made her more cold and hungry instead of less so. some very odd things happen in this world sometimes. it certainly was an odd thing that happened to sara. she had to cross the street just when she was saying this to herself. so she crossed the pavement and put her wet foot on the step. as she did so she saw something that made her stop. sara knew they were hungry eyes the moment she saw them and she felt a sudden sympathy. she was used to being made to give room to everybody. then she spoke to her. she asked. she said in a hoarse voice. said sara. asked sara. just to look at her made sara more hungry and faint. but those queer little thoughts were at work in her brain and she was talking to herself though she was sick at heart. they always shared. if it had been sixpence i could have eaten six. it wont be enough for either of us. she went into the shop. the woman went to the window and put some in a paper bag. sara noticed that she put in six. a mist rose before saras eyes. she looked frightful in her wet and dirty rags. she was muttering to herself. she was only a poor little wild animal. when she reached the other side of the street she looked back. she exclaimed. it wasnt because she didnt want them either. well well she looked hungry enough. then her curiosity got the better of her. she went to the door and spoke to the beggar child. she asked her. inquired the woman. the child nodded. the woman thought it over. then she turned to the child. she said. she did not know what was going to happen. she did not care even. at all events it was very hot and it was better than nothing. as she walked along she broke off small pieces and ate them slowly to make them last longer. the lights in the houses were all lighted. on the contrary there was a good deal of excitement going on. the pretty rosy mother was standing near him talking as if she was asking final questions. sara paused a moment to see the little ones lifted up and kissed and the bigger ones bent over and kissed also. oh dear how they will miss him cried another. run into the house. it is a hideous damp night. i would rather stay with you than go to moscow. good night then they went in and shut the door. she looked all cold and wet and i saw her turn her head over her shoulder and look at us. mamma says her clothes always look as if they had been given her by someone who was quite rich someone who only let her have them because they were too shabby to wear. the attic had been very still all the day after sara had left it in the early morning. the sound suggested that something was moving on the roof. he was frightened to death. he asked ram dass in a whisper. exclaimed the young man. ram dass made a gesture with his hands. he also smiled respectfully. i see her when she does not see me. i watch her from my window when she does not know i am near. she stands on the table there and looks out at the sky as if it spoke to her. the poor slave of the house comes to her for comfort. this i have seen when i have crept across the roof. first he went to the narrow bed. a special journey can be made to bring it across. he lifted the covering and examined the one thin pillow. he looked up from it as he tore off a leaf and slipped it into his breast pocket. i am fond of this child we are both lonely. she seemed to see it as she talked and she grew cheered and warmed as she spoke. then she came to this fancy and the next day the sahib being ill and wretched i told him of the thing to amuse him. it seemed then but a dream but it pleased the sahib. he became interested in her and asked questions. he smiled as if his heart warmed under his white robe and the secretary smiled back at him. the young secretary seemed interested in everything. his head was resting in his hand and he looked as lonely and unhappy as ever. said sara. she demanded. sara went in to the cook. she snapped. she was in a very savage humor indeed. sara asked rather faintly. sara stood silent for a second. she made it low because she was afraid it would tremble. sara went and found the bread. it was old and hard and dry. she often found them long and steep when she was tired but tonight it seemed as if she would never reach the top. several times she was obliged to stop to rest. that meant that ermengarde had managed to creep up to pay her a visit. there was some comfort in that. it was better than to go into the room alone and find it empty and desolate. the mere presence of plump comfortable ermengarde wrapped in her red shawl would warm it a little. yes there ermengarde was when she opened the door. she was sitting in the middle of the bed with her feet tucked safely under her. when she found herself alone in the attic she always preferred to sit on the bed until sara arrived. ermengarde crawled forward on the bed to look at her. sara was quite sure he knew it. sara had not looked toward it as she came in. a number of books were piled upon it. sara looked round and got up at once. she ran to the table and picking up the top volume turned over its leaves quickly. exclaimed ermengarde. sara was opening one book after the other. sara put down her book and shook her head slowly. she pulled herself up and stopped rather suddenly. ermengarde asked. she always felt very tender of ermengarde and tried not to let her feel too strongly the difference between being able to learn anything at once and not being able to learn anything at all. as she looked at her plump face one of her wise oldfashioned thoughts came to her. to be kind is worth a great deal to other people. lots of clever people have done harm and have been wicked. she demanded. she took off her hat and coat and hung them on a nail against the wall and she changed her wet shoes for an old pair of slippers. it was agreed that mr. st. john was to be told the plan they had made and for the present the books were to be left in the attic. she glanced round the room. it made her feel rather like a soldier. she felt as if she had never been quite so hungry before. sara pulled down her sleeve which had pushed itself up. not quite as silently however. sara who had keen ears suddenly turned a little and looked up at the roof. said ermengarde a little startled. asked sara. said ermengarde. they both heard the sound that checked her. sara sprang off the bed and put out the candle. she will think i am in bed. it was very seldom that miss minchin mounted the last flight of stairs. sara could only remember that she had done it once before. but now she was angry enough to be coming at least part of the way up and it sounded as if she was driving becky before her. they heard her say. the meat pie had been intended for her special late supper. they heard her door shut and knew that she threw herself upon her bed. sara stood in the middle of the room in the darkness. she could scarcely stand still but she dared not move until miss minchin had gone down the stairs and all was still. she burst forth. she doesnt she doesnt sara was crying suppose suppose a new dread possibility presented itself to her kind slow little mind all at once. she crept off the bed in the dark and found her way to the table where the candle stood. she struck a match and lit the candle. it was too much just at that moment. sara lifted her face from her hands. im so hungry now that i could almost eat you. and it makes it worse to hear poor becky. ermengarde gasped. ermengarde broke in. and she pulled out the thin ribbon from her neck. somehow the sight of the dear little sixpence was good for both of them. it made them laugh a little though they both had tears in their eyes. asked ermengarde looking at it quite as if it had not been a mere ordinary silver sixpence. ermengarde gave a little jump backward. she cried. said ermengarde in an excited hurry. it is full of good things. when one is faint with hunger the mention of food has sometimes a curious effect. she clutched ermengardes arm. then she went back to sara. everybodys in bed. it was so delightful that they caught each others hands and a sudden light sprang into saras eyes. she said. let us pretend its a party yes let us knock on the wall now. sara went to the wall. through it she could hear poor becky crying more softly. she knocked four times. almost immediately the door of the attic opened and becky appeared. cried ermengarde. beckys cap almost fell off entirely she broke in with such excitement. she said. no one saw it for a minute or so. she caught her breath. it is as if the magic did it. if i could only just remember that always. she gave becky a little cheerful shake. she said. said becky gazing round the room. sara looked round the attic too. it was ermengardes red shawl which lay upon the floor. they pulled the old table forward and threw the shawl over it. red is a wonderfully kind and comfortable color. it began to make the room look furnished directly. exclaimed sara. she was always quite serious. said sara and she stood still and put her hands over her eyes. in a moment she did. she cried. i know now it had not been put in the attic for her benefit but because there was no room for it elsewhere. but she knew she should find something. the magic always arranged that kind of thing in one way or another. she seized them joyfully and ran to the table. sara turned suddenly to find her standing by the table looking very queer indeed. she looked as if she was trying to lift some enormous weight. sara cried. becky opened her eyes with a start. i wouldnt try so hard just at first. it will come to you after a while. ill just tell you what things are. there was a wreath of flowers on it. she pulled the wreath off. she inquired. whispered becky. said sara. gasped becky again. she cried out. said sara. cried ermengarde. then ermengarde had a sudden brilliant thought. she exclaimed. she stood in the dancing glow and smiled. she said. she led the way to the table. she was in the midst of her dream. she turned her head slightly toward the corner of the room. someone was coming up the stairs. there was no mistake about it. choked becky and dropped her piece of cake upon the floor. miss minchin struck the door open with a blow of her hand. she was pale herself but it was with rage. so they knew that it was lavinia who had somehow guessed their secret and had betrayed them. she said. ermengarde burst into tears. she turned fiercely on sara. she stamped her foot at becky. she commanded and becky stole away her face hidden in her apron her shoulders shaking. then it was saras turn again. you will have something to remember. dont stand there. take them up and go back to bed. you will stay there all day tomorrow and i shall write to your papa. something she saw in saras grave fixed gaze at this moment made her turn on her fiercely. she demanded. it was very like the scene in the schoolroom. it was only sad and quiet. she flew at her and shook her. she cried. the dream was quite at an end. emily was sitting with her back against the wall staring very hard. sara saw her and went and picked her up with trembling hands. and she sat down and hid her face. but she did not look up. she sat with her little black head in her arms for some time. she always sat like that when she was trying to bear something in silence. then she got up and went slowly to the bed. she did not know how long she slept. when she awakened it was rather suddenly and she did not know that any particular thing had called her out of her sleep. at first she did not open her eyes. she felt too sleepy and curiously enough too warm and comfortable. she was so warm and comfortable indeed that she did not believe she was really awake. she murmured. of course it was a dream. but she could not even though she kept her eyes closed tightly she could not. her eyes opened in spite of herself. and then she actually smiled for what she saw she had never seen in the attic before and knew she never should see. she knew it must be a dream for if she were awake such things could not could not be. do you wonder that she felt sure she had not come back to earth this is what she saw. she sat up resting on her elbow and her breathing came short and fast. im dreaming it feels real. its bewitched or im bewitched. her words began to hurry themselves. she stood panting a moment longer and then cried out again. she said. the blazing fire drew her to it and she knelt down and held out her hands close to it so close that the heat made her start back. she almost sobbed. she threw it over her shoulders and put her feet into the slippers. she cried. when she saw that wasnt it a strange thing for her to do she put her face down upon the page and burst into tears. she whispered as loudly as she dared. the face she saw was a shining wonderful thing. becky was too frightened to speak. she simply got up and followed her with her mouth and eyes open and without a word. she cried. they are as real as we are. and here we are sitting by their fire and and its true you never really eat things in dreams. you only think you are going to eat them. and with this conviction a reality at least she went away. the elder girls in the schoolroom knew that if miss minchin did not send sara away it was for practical reasons of her own. shes such a baby she didnt know she was telling me. there was nothing nasty at all in speaking to miss minchin. inquired jessie a trifle anxiously. snapped lavinia. miss minchin had expected to see in sara when she appeared in the schoolroom very much what lavinia had expected to see. it gave her quite a shock. what was the child made of what could such a thing mean she called her at once to her desk. all through the day the light was in saras face and the color in her cheek. she was probably determined to brave the matter out. one thing sara had resolved upon as she thought things over. the wonders which had happened must be kept a secret if such a thing were possible. if miss minchin should choose to mount to the attic again of course all would be discovered. but it did not seem likely that she would do so for some time at least unless she was led by suspicion. ermengarde could be told the story and trusted to keep it secret. if i never know who it is if i never can even thank him i shall never feel quite so lonely. but what does anything matter when ones magic has just proved itself ones friend. it was quite late when she was at last allowed to go upstairs. she had been told to go into the schoolroom and study until ten oclock and she had become interested in her work and remained over her books later. when she reached the top flight of stairs and stood before the attic door it must be confessed that her heart beat rather fast. she pushed the door open and went in. once inside she gasped slightly shut the door and stood with her back against it looking from side to side. the magic had been there again. it actually had and it had done even more than before. the fire was blazing in lovely leaping flames more merrily than ever. sara slowly moved away from the door and simply sat down and looked and looked again. i feel as if i might wish for anything diamonds or bags of gold and they would appear that wouldnt be any stranger than this. is this my garret am i the same cold ragged damp sara and to think i used to pretend and pretend and wish there were fairies the one thing i always wanted was to see a fairy story come true. i am living in a fairy story. she rose and knocked upon the wall for the prisoner in the next cell and the prisoner came. when she entered she almost dropped in a heap upon the floor. for a few seconds she quite lost her breath. she gasped. becky broke forth once. from that time life became more wonderful day by day. the fairy story continued. almost every day something new was done. when sara went downstairs in the morning the remains of the supper were on the table and when she returned to the attic in the evening the magician had removed them and left another nice little meal. but what did it all matter while she was living in this wonderful mysterious story it was more romantic and delightful than anything she had ever invented to comfort her starved young soul and save herself from despair. sometimes when she was scolded she could scarcely keep from smiling. she was saying to herself. the comfort and happiness she enjoyed were making her stronger and she had them always to look forward to. in a very short time she began to look less thin. color came into her cheeks and her eyes did not seem so much too big for her face. exclaimed miss minchin angrily. miss amelia ventured. but she remembered very clearly indeed. she could not help it. she had her share in the secret fairy story too. sometimes sara read aloud from her books sometimes she learned her own lessons sometimes she sat and looked into the fire and tried to imagine who her friend could be and wished she could say to him some of the things in her heart. then it came about that another wonderful thing happened. sara herself was sent to open the door and take them in. exclaimed miss minchin. she demanded. sara did as she was told. what she saw was pretty and comfortable clothing clothing of different kinds
shoes stockings and gloves and a warm and beautiful coat. there were even a nice hat and an umbrella. miss minchin was quite agitated. she felt very queer indeed and very uncertain and she gave a side glance at sara. as the things have been sent and you are to have new ones when they are worn out you may as well go and put them on and look respectable. after you are dressed you may come downstairs and learn your lessons in the schoolroom. everybody was looking and when lavinia looked she turned quite red. it was the princess sara indeed. at least since the days when she had been a princess sara had never looked as she did now. she did not seem the sara they had seen come down the back stairs a few hours ago. it was deep and warm in color and beautifully made. that night when she went to her room after she and becky had eaten their supper she sat and looked at the fire seriously for a long time. when sara sat in silence and looked into the coals with dreaming eyes it generally meant that she was making a new story. but this time she was not and she shook her head. becky stared still respectfully. but i do so want him to know how thankful i am to him and how happy he has made me. anyone who is kind wants to know when people have been made happy. they care for that more than for being thanked. it was something she had found in the room when she came up to it only two days before. she rose and went to the corner and brought the case back to the fire. then perhaps the person who takes the things away will take it too. i wont ask him anything. so she wrote a note. i am so grateful to you and i am so happy and so is becky. becky feels just as thankful as i do it is all just as beautiful and wonderful to her as it is to me. we used to be so lonely and cold and hungry and now oh just think what you have done for us please let me say just these words. it seems as if i ought to say them. thank you thank you thank you the little girl in the attic. the next morning she left this on the little table and in the evening it had been taken away with the other things so she knew the magician had received it and she was happier for the thought. she suddenly remembered something and laughed. becky ran to her side. she said. theyre delicate. he knew she would not hurt him. said becky. your mother couldnt be proud of you and no one would dare to say you looked like any of your relations. she leaned back in her chair and reflected. i wonder if he has a mind. but the monkey only put up a tiny paw and scratched his head. becky asked. i am sorry to take you back monkey but you must go. and when she went to bed she made him a nest at her feet and he curled up and slept there as if he were a baby and much pleased with his quarters. the next afternoon three members of the large family sat in the indian gentlemans library doing their best to cheer him up. this event was the return of mr. carmichael from moscow. when he felt at last sure that he had found them and had gone to their house he had been told that they were absent on a journey. it must be owned that he was riding it rather violently. turning to the indian gentleman. but he only patted her shoulder. the indian gentleman took hold of her hand quickly. he didnt mean to do it and it would break his heart. did you tell him she has new nice clothes they all ran to the windows to look out. mr. carmichaels voice approached the door. then the door opened and he came in. i have seen and talked to her. his hand dropped from mr. carmichaels. mr. carmichael took a seat. somehow he had gradually grown fond of this unhappy man. and that a man should be compelled to carry about in his breast the thought that he had seemed to wrong and desert a child was not a thing one could face. mr. carmichael felt rather restless and he rose and began to pace the room with a thoughtful though uncertain face. let us give up paris and begin in london. then he slightly started roused by a recollection. perhaps the magic was at work again at that very moment the beautiful magic. it really seemed as if it might be so. she brings back the monkey who had again run away to her attic under the roof. i have asked that she remain. inquired mr. carmichael. he waved his hand to ram dass and addressed him. then he turned to mr. carmichael. the days were so dark and long. i suppose it was a childish thing to do but it gave me something to plan and think of. then sara came into the room. she carried the monkey in her arms and he evidently did not intend to part from her if it could be helped. i would have brought him back if it had not been so late. the indian gentlemans hollow eyes dwelt on her with curious interest. sara looked toward ram dass who stood near the door. she asked. said the indian gentleman smiling a little. the indian gentleman sat upright so suddenly and with such a change of expression that she was for a moment quite startled. and he held out his hand. sara went to him and laid her hand in his as he seemed to want to take it. something seemed to be the matter with him. he demanded. she hesitated a moment. the queer little sad smile was on saras lips again. the big kind father of the large family knew how to question little girls. he inquired. the indian gentleman cried out loudly. it was his friend who took his money. the indian gentlemans breath came more quickly. the indian gentleman said. for a moment sara thought he was going to die. ram dass poured out drops from a bottle and held them to his lips. sara stood near trembling a little. she looked in a bewildered way at mr. carmichael. sara put her hand up to her forehead and her mouth trembled. she spoke as if she were in a dream. she was sent for at once and came across the square to take sara into her warm arms and make clear to her all that had happened. then mrs. carmichael came in. she looked very much moved and suddenly took sara in her arms and kissed her. sara could only think of one thing. mrs. carmichael was crying as she kissed her again. she felt as if she ought to be kissed very often because she had not been kissed for so long. he only thought he had lost it and because he loved him so much his grief made him so ill that for a time he was not in his right mind. somehow she could not forget that she had been so near. he has looked for you everywhere. when he saw you pass by looking so sad and neglected he did not dream that you were his friends poor child but because you were a little girl too he was sorry for you and wanted to make you happier. sara gave a start of joy her whole look changed. she cried out. the library door opened and mr. carmichael appeared calling sara to him with a gesture. sara did not wait. she went and stood before his chair with her hands clasped together against her breast. he was weak and broken with long illness and trouble but he looked at her with the look she remembered in her fathers eyes that look of loving her and wanting to take her in his arms. and she dropped her face on his thin hand and kissed it again and again. in fact he did look changed. in the first place there was miss minchin. the indian gentleman was very determined upon that point. she must remain where she was and mr. carmichael should go and see miss minchin himself. cried miss minchin to miss amelia. miss minchin entered the room with a sternly dignified manner. he was a man who had naturally a rather hot temper and he did not wish it to get too much the better of him. he said. she said. i have come here as a matter of duty. she turned upon sara. the indian gentleman drew sara to his side and patted her hand. miss minchin felt rather as if she must be losing her senses. she repeated. miss minchin fell back in amazed indignation. with you sir and he made sara sit down again and held her hands in his which was another trick of her papas. miss minchin gasped out. if this was true nothing so horrible she felt had ever happened to her since she was born. here the indian gentleman lost his temper. she must finish her education. she said. sara took a step toward her and stood still. she looked miss minchin steadily in the face. sara looked down and flushed a little because she thought her pet fancy might not be easy for strangers even nice ones to understand at first. she returned home and going to her sitting room sent at once for miss amelia. perhaps if i were not so timid it would be better for the school and for both of us. exclaimed miss minchin. the child was a clever child and a good child and she would have paid you for any kindness you had shown her. but you didnt show her any. she cried. that evening when the pupils were gathered together before the fire in the schoolroom as was their custom before going to bed ermengarde came in with a letter in her hand and a queer expression on her round face. cried two or three voices at once. said lavinia eagerly. where has she been sent away does miss minchin know was the row about that why did she write tell us shouted jessie. and he did not know where sara was. and i am going to see her tomorrow afternoon. becky who had heard it also managed to creep up stairs earlier than usual. she wanted to get away from people and go and look at the little magic room once more. she did not know what would happen to it. it was not likely that it would be left to miss minchin. it would be taken away and the attic would be bare and empty again. there would be no fire tonight and no rosy lamp no supper and no princess sitting in the glow reading or telling stories no princess she wished you to know the good fortune which has befallen her. she has written. she did not wish that you should go to sleep unhappy. everybody wanted to be told over and over again the things which had happened to her. when one was sitting by a warm fire in a big glowing room it was quite delightful to hear how cold it could be in an attic. of course the thing loved best was the story of the banquet and the dream which was true. sara told it for the first time the day after she had been found. when she had finished she looked up at him and put her hand on his knee. these and many other exciting things the children found out by asking a thousand questions. there never were such friends as these two became. somehow they seemed to suit each other in a wonderful way. the indian gentleman had never had a companion he liked quite as much as he liked sara. there were so many charming things to plan for sara. but the hours when sara and the indian gentleman sat alone and read or talked had a special charm of their own. during their passing many interesting things occurred. he asked. sara looked up with a bright color on her cheek. she told it quite simply and in as few words as possible but somehow the indian gentleman found it necessary to shade his eyes with his hand and look down at the carpet. try to forget it. the next morning miss minchin in looking out of her window saw the things she perhaps least enjoyed seeing. the little figure was a familiar one and reminded miss minchin of days in the past. already becky had a pink round face. for a moment she looked at sara very hard indeed and then her goodnatured face lighted up. she turned round to the indian gentleman and spoke her next words to him. yes miss. the woman watched her and listened with an astonished face. exclaimed sara. she stepped to the door of the little back parlor and spoke and the next minute a girl came out and followed her behind the counter. she looked shy but she had a nice face now that she was no longer a savage and the wild look had gone from her eyes. she knew sara in an instant and stood and looked at her as if she could never look enough. and somehow sara felt as if she understood her though she said so little and only stood still and looked and looked after her as she went out of the shop with the indian gentleman and they got into the carriage and drove away. sighed meg looking down at her old dress. and beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time. dont you wish we had the money papa lost when we were little jo dear me said meg who could remember better times. well i think we are. jo immediately sat up put her hands in her pockets and began to whistle. its bad enough to be a girl anyway when i like boys games and work and manners i cant get over my disappointment in not being a boy. and its worse than ever now for im dying to go and fight with papa. its too bad but it cant be helped. margaret the eldest of the four was sixteen and very pretty being plump and fair with large eyes plenty of soft brown hair a sweet mouth and white hands of which she was rather vain. amy though the youngest was a most important person in her own opinion at least. what the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out. the clock struck six and having swept up the hearth beth put a pair of slippers down to warm. cried amy. exclaimed jo. asked meg. answered jo. i never saw anyone faint and i dont choose to make myself all black and blue tumbling flat as you do. if i can go down easily ill drop. if i cant i shall fall into a chair and be graceful. save me i always wanted to do the killing part. there was so much to do getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow that i didnt come home to dinner. has anyone called beth how is your cold meg jo you look tired to death. the girls flew about trying to make things comfortable each in her own way. beth trotted to and fro between parlor kitchen quiet and busy while amy gave directions to everyone as she sat with her hands folded. a letter he is well and thinks he shall get through the cold season better than we feared. he will stay and do his work faithfully as long as he can and we wont ask for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared. they all drew to the fire mother in the big chair with beth at her feet meg and amy perched on either arm of the chair and jo leaning on the back where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter should happen to be touching. tell them i think of them by day pray for them by night and find my best comfort in their affection at all times. a year seems very long to wait before i see them but remind them that while we wait we may all work so that these hard days need not be wasted. beths bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh but nobody did for it would have hurt her feelings very much. we ought to have our roll of directions like christian. they talked over the new plan while old hannah cleared the table then out came the four little work baskets and the needles flew as the girls made sheets for aunt march. at nine they stopped work and sang as usual before they went to bed. chapter two 
a merry christmas 
jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of christmas morning. then she opened her new book and began to read. jo put her arm round her and leaning cheek to cheek read also with the quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face. come amy lets do as they do. asked meg as she and jo ran down to thank her for their gifts half an hour later. she added as the little flask did not appear. march. cried jo taking one up. asked meg surprised to see by her hood and cloak that lazy amy had been out so early. i didnt mean anyone should know till the time came. many of them thank you for our books. im glad you began at once and hope you will keep on. but i want to say one word before we sit down. there is nothing to eat over there and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold. asked beth eagerly. they were soon ready and the procession set out. fortunately it was early and they went through back streets so few people saw them and no one laughed at the queer party. how the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in. said the poor woman crying for joy. in a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there. the girls meantime spread the table set the children round the fire and fed them like so many hungry birds laughing talking and trying to understand the funny broken english. cried the poor things as they ate and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze. that was a very happy breakfast though they didnt get any of it. strike up beth open the door amy mrs. march was both surprised and touched and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the little notes which accompanied them. make it sweet and swift and strong     spirit answer now my song and dropping a small gilded bottle at the witchs feet the spirit vanished. then came the grand effect of the play. she forgot her train. asked amy. and meg smiled her sweetest in spite of her gray beard and white eyebrows. what in the world put such a thing into his head exclaimed meg. he is an odd old gentleman but that pleased him. hes a capital fellow and i wish we could get acquainted. asked one of the girls. we invited him to our party but he didnt come. he brought the flowers himself and i should have asked him in if i had been sure what was going on upstairs. laughed jo looking at her boots. perhaps hell help act. and meg examined her flowers with great interest. jo cried meg at the foot of the garret stairs. jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the news. only see answered jo with her mouth full. sighed meg. yours is as good as new but i forgot the burn and the tear in mine. whatever shall i do the front is all right. i dont care much for company dancing. its no fun to go sailing round. she said when you spoiled the others that she shouldnt get you any more this winter. thats all i can do. no ill tell you how we can manage each wear one good one and carry a bad one. cried jo taking up her book. what have you done im spoiled i cant go you shouldnt have asked me to do it. i always spoil everything. ill lift my eyebrows if any thing is wrong and nod if you are all right. now hold your shoulder straight and take short steps and dont shake hands if you are introduced to anyone. i never can. asked the boy trying to look sober while his black eyes shone with fun. asked laurie looking as if he thought the name suited her. in a place like this im sure to upset something tread on peoples toes or do something dreadful so i keep out of mischief and let meg sail about. cried jo. cried jo. you may laugh if you want to. but laurie didnt laugh. ill tell you how we can manage. im sorry. i cant stop here for the house is full. sallie has some girls staying with her. dont ask or tell anyone. ill stay with you. said a friendly voice. and there was laurie with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other. i was looking for someone to give this to. ill show you where she is. hannah scolded meg cried and jo was at her wits end till she decided to take things into her own hands. please let me take you home. laurie went on the box so meg could keep her foot up and the girls talked over their party in freedom. laurie and i couldnt help laughing. jo told her adventures and by the time she had finished they were at home. and i think jo was quite right. she had not heart enough even to make herself pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing her hair in the most becoming way. so meg went down wearing an injured look and wasnt at all agreeable at breakfast time. the poor things got no other lunch and were seldom home before two. they always looked back before turning the corner for their mother was always at the window to nod and smile and wave her hand to them. but meg laughed at the nonsense and felt better in spite of herself. thank goodness i can always find something funny to keep me up. when mr. march lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate friend the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something toward their own support at least. she found it harder to bear than the others because she could remember a time when home was beautiful life full of ease and pleasure and want of any kind unknown. jo happened to suit aunt march who was lame and needed an active person to wait upon her. jos ambition was to do something very splendid. it had been tried but she suffered so much that it was given up and she did her lessons at home with her father. she had to wear her cousins clothes. my dear its really dreadful for sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her knees and she cant come to school. id just got to where they all tumbled into the water when i forgot and laughed out loud. asked meg. what a pleasant life she might have if only she chose it isnt funny like jos story but i thought about it a good deal as i came home. i wanted it dreadfully and wished i was her with all my might. he took her by the ear the ear just fancy how horrid not one she was so glad and surprised she took it right into her arms and thanked him over and over. wasnt it good of him he sat down near me and i began to talk to him for he looked poor and tired and anxious. id go myself if i was any use. i had all my girls to comfort me at home and his last son was waiting miles away to say goodby to him perhaps mrs. march smiled and began at once for she had told stories to this little audience for many years and knew how to please them. here jo looked up quickly as if about to speak but changed her mind seeing that the story was not done yet. cried meg. added jo who could not for the life of her help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon though she took it to heart as much as any of them. the snow was light and with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden for beth to walk in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air. he needs a party of jolly boys to play with or somebody young and lively. all quiet curtains down at the lower windows servants out of sight and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window. all alone and sick this dismal day. its a shame cried laurie. ill go ask her. tell the girl to put it away for your tea. yes thats what it wanted. ill talk all day if youll only set me going. asked laurie with interest. i beg your pardon for being so rude but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are. and when the lamps are lighted its like looking at a picture to see the fire and you all around the table with your mother. her face is right opposite and it looks so sweet behind the flowers i cant help watching it. the solitary hungry look in his eyes went straight to jos warm heart. she had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child. laurie was sick and lonely and feeling how rich she was in home and happiness she gladly tried to share it with him. i just wish though instead of peeping youd come over and see us. mother is so splendid shed do you heaps of good and beth would sing to you if i begged her to and amy would dance. we want to know you and ive been trying to do it this ever so long. asked the boy changing the subject after a little pause during which he stared at the fire and jo looked about her well pleased. laurie opened his mouth to ask another question but remembering just in time that it wasnt manners to make too many inquiries into peoples affairs he shut it again and looked uncomfortable. that does me no end of good. then they got to talking about books and to jos delight she found that laurie loved them as well as she did and had read even more than herself. im only afraid you are very tired of talking to me. laurie went away and his guest amused herself in her own way. that answer pleased the old gentleman. was the next question sharply put. and jo told how her visit came about. that was the boys affair. i shall come and see your mother some fine day. tell her so. theres the tea bell we have it early on the boys account. thought jo as she was marched away while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story at home. but finding them free and easy she was so herself and made a good impression. they found mr. laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing room but jos attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano which stood open. his music isnt bad but i hope he will do as well in more important things. going well im much obliged to you and i hope youll come again. my respects to your mother. he shook hands kindly but looked as if something did not please him. he shook his head. i am not a young lady and its only a step. asked jo who was of an inquiring disposition. the lady was good and lovely and accomplished but he did not like her and never saw his son after he married. they both died when laurie was a little child and then his grandfather took him home. laurie comes naturally by his love of music for he is like his mother and i dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician. exclaimed meg. said jo. and jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her before. chapter six 
beth finds the palace beautiful 
the big house did prove a palace beautiful though it took some time for all to get in and beth found it very hard to pass the lions. old mr. laurence was the biggest one but after he had called said something funny or kind to each one of the girls and talked over old times with their mother nobody felt much afraid of him except timid beth. let him do what he likes as long as he is happy. what good times they had to be sure. at the back of his chair she stopped and stood listening with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with excitement of this unusual performance. here he rose as if going and beth made up her mind to speak for that last arrangement left nothing to be desired. as he looked down at her very kindly. beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore but she was not frightened now and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her. god bless you my dear and away he went in a great hurry. she never saw laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away. so she enjoyed herself heartily and found what isnt always the case that her granted wish was all she had hoped. perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a greater was given her. at any rate she deserved both. he is so kind to me i must thank him and i dont know any other way. when this excitement was over beth waited to see what would happen. isnt it splendid of him dont you think hes the dearest old man in the world heres the key in the letter. i cant i feel so queer and beth hid her face in jos apron quite upset by her present. said amy who thought the oldfashioned address very elegant. laurie told me how fond mr. laurence used to be of the child who died and how he kept all her little things carefully. just think hes given you her piano. only think of his writing that to you. ill tell the girls. so beth tried it and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable piano ever heard. they would have been still more amazed if they had seen what beth did afterward. if the roof of the house had suddenly flown off the old gentleman wouldnt have been more astonished. but he liked it. and meg looked sober. and meg tried to keep her countenance amy looked so grave and important. asked meg taking out her purse. you may have my share. heres the money. it must be so nice to have pocket money but alas alas whispered her neighbor a young lady of great presence of mind. this this was too much. they were neither many nor heavy but that made no difference to her. for the first time in her life she had been struck and the disgrace in her eyes was as deep as if he had knocked her down. that was dreadful. had never seemed so welcome to her before. she was in a sad state when she got home and when the older girls arrived some time later an indignation meeting was held at once. i wish all the girls would leave and spoil his old school. cried amy. asked amy. you were whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night and you stopped when i came in. i know please let me. ive been sick with this cold so long and shut up im dying for some fun. do meg or hell get another seat for you and that isnt proper when you werent asked. her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get jo into a fury because she was such an angel afterward. when they got home they found amy reading in the parlor. she assumed an injured air as they came in never lifted her eyes from her book or asked a single question. at once and looked surprised. jo saw her color rise and was down upon her in a minute. and jo gave her a slight shake. my little book i was so fond of and worked over and meant to finish before father got home the storm cleared up below for mrs. march came home and having heard the story soon brought amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her sister. it was only half a dozen little fairy tales but jo had worked over them patiently putting her whole heart into her work hoping to make something good enough to print. mrs. march looked grave and grieved and amy felt that no one would love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted more than any of them. they felt this most when singing time came for beth could only play jo stood dumb as a stone and amy broke down so meg and mother sang alone. jo still looked like a thunder cloud and nothing went well all day. she promised i should go next time for this is the last ice we shall have. it was not far to the river but both were ready before amy reached them. jo saw her coming and turned her back. jo heard but amy was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word. she tried to call laurie but her voice was gone. when amy was comfortably asleep the house quiet and mrs. march sitting by the bed she called jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands. i only let her go. oh mother what shall i do cried poor jo in despair. it seems as if i could do anything when im in a passion. i get so savage i could hurt anyone and enjoy it. im afraid i shall do something dreadful some day and spoil my life and make everybody hate me. she felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her. that is what troubles me for the sharp words fly out before i know what im about and the more i say the worse i get till its a pleasure to hurt peoples feelings and say dreadful things. then your father came and i was so happy that i found it easy to be good. you have had a warning. but you must help me remind me and keep me from flying out. i used to see father sometimes put his finger on his lips and look at you with a very kind but sober face and you always folded your lips tight and went away. asked jo softly. why should i complain when we both have merely done our duty and will surely be the happier for it in the end the more you love and trust him the nearer you will feel to him and the less you will depend on human power and wisdom. amy stirred and sighed in her sleep and as if eager to begin at once to mend her fault jo looked up with an expression on her face which it had never worn before. i wouldnt forgive her and today if it hadnt been for laurie it might have been too late as if she heard amy opened her eyes and held out her arms with a smile that went straight to jos heart. the violet silk would be so nice. i didnt like to say anything but i was sadly disappointed in my umbrella. you are a dear to lend me yours jo. said meg impatiently. her older sisters were very fine young ladies and one was engaged which was extremely interesting and romantic meg thought. the hard bitter feeling was getting pretty bad when the maid brought in a box of flowers. who are they from she enjoyed herself very much that evening for she danced to her hearts content. so altogether she had a very nice time till she overheard a bit of conversation which disturbed her extremely. poor thing shed be so nice if she was only got up in style. asked another voice. as that was impossible she did her best to seem gay and being rather excited she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making. those foolish yet well meant words had opened a new world to meg and much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived as happily as a child. something in the manner of her friends struck meg at once. they treated her with more respect she thought took quite a tender interest in what she said and looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity. and meg laughed also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her supposed lover. asked sallie. said sallie who was not an observing young lady. where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she isnt out yet i admire to do it and youd be a regular little beauty with a touch here and there. several young ladies who had taken no notice of her before were very affectionate all of a sudden. asked meg full of curiosity to know his opinion of her yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time. the girls dressed me up for fun and i rather like it. said meg bent on making him say whether he thought her improved or not. asked meg. in an anxious tone. i wanted you to see her but they have spoiled her entirely. sighed meg. come ill be good. and he waved his hands as if words failed to express his admiration. but id rather do it myself. you dont look as if you were having a good time. dont think im horrid. but he got no chance to deliver it for meg kept away from him till he came to say good night. dont i always tell you everything laurie thought i wasnt proper. i know he did though he didnt say so and one man called me a doll. and jo laughed as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good joke. said meg looking distressed. ill forget all the bad and remember only the good for i did enjoy a great deal and thank you very much for letting me go. i know im a silly little girl and ill stay with you till im fit to take care of myself. i will tell you some of them for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and heart of yours right on a very serious subject. jo went and sat on one arm of the chair looking as if she thought they were about to join in some very solemn affair. it is natural to think of it meg right to hope and wait for it and wise to prepare for it so that when the happy time comes you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy. leave these things to time. make this home happy so that you may be fit for homes of your own if they are offered you and contented here if they are not. one thing remember my girls. cried both with all their hearts as she bade them good night. the garden had to be put in order and each sister had a quarter of the little plot to do what she liked with. now my children let the play end. she is useful and mild and does her best     but she is not fair to see     and we cannot give her your place dear     nor worship her as we worship thee. jo bad. beth very good. aye replied three voices at once. bless you its the old martin house but ive stopped up the door and made the roof open so it will hold all sorts of things and save our valuable time. how they laughed when the secret came out never dreaming how many love letters that little post office would hold in the years to come. said jo. next morning meg did not appear till ten oclock. jo spent the morning on the river with laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over the wide wide world up in the apple tree. beth got on pretty well for she was constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work and fell back into her old ways now and then. she didnt like dolls fairy tales were childish and one couldnt draw all the time. when they got up on saturday morning there was no fire in the kitchen no breakfast in the dining room and no mother anywhere to be seen. cried jo staring about her in dismay. meg ran upstairs and soon came back again looking relieved but rather bewildered and a little ashamed. its a very queer thing for her to do she doesnt act a bit like herself. i dont know how but the book tells. asked jo rather hurt. oh pip oh pip cried beth taking the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore him. its a pity but nothing goes right this week and pip has had the worst of the experiment. putting on a big apron she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for washing when she discovered that the fire was out. hannah had left a pan of bread to rise meg had worked it up early set it on the hearth for a second rising and forgotten it. fearing to ask any more advice she did her best alone and discovered that something more than energy and good will is necessary to make a cook. exclaimed jo trembling. they did sober themselves for beths sake. laurie took amy to drive which was a deed of charity for the sour cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper. mrs. march came home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the afternoon and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success of one part of the experiment. began jo usually the first to speak. cried jo decidedly. while hannah and i did your work you got on pretty well though i dont think you were very happy or amiable. so i thought as a little lesson i would show you what happens when everyone thinks only of herself. cried the girls. i can and i will though im not fond of sewing. said meg. and they did. never mind the other may be found. i said i wished bigger hats were the fashion because i burn my face every hot day. wear a big hat and be comfortable i said i would if i had one and he has sent me this to try me. one from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill for it said to her...
my dear
i write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction i watch your efforts to control your temper. some english girls and boys are coming to see me tomorrow and i want to have a jolly time. they are nice people and like such things. i want you all to come cant let beth off at any price and nobody shall worry her. in a tearing hurry yours ever laurie. cried jo flying in to tell the news to meg. asked meg. kate is older than you fred and frank twins about my age and a little girl grace who is nine or ten. laurie knew them abroad and liked the boys. but i dont want to play or sing or say anything. i wish he would go too. theres laurie looking like a sailor nice boy oh mercy me heres a carriage full of people a tall lady a little girl and two dreadful boys. laurie didnt tell us that. be quick girls its getting late. how queer that he should come. i thought he was at the mountains. there is sallie. im glad she got back in time. its too absurd mr. brooke was a grave silent young man with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice. frank beth amy and grace sat down to watch the game played by the other eight. mr. brooke chose meg kate and fred. fred was close behind her and his turn came before hers. i saw you. it rolled a bit perhaps but that is allowed. she went off to get her ball and was a long time finding it among the bushes but she came back looking cool and quiet and waited her turn patiently. added jo as they both laughed and ate out of one plate the china having run short. this is no credit to me you know i dont do anything. its you and meg and brooke who make it all go and im no end obliged to you. go and ask her. every day when he gave his lessons to this pet of the kings the knight rode him through the city and as he rode he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face which he had seen many times in his dreams but never found. at last he resolved to get into the castle and ask how he could help them. he went and knocked. till you tell me how i may rescue you swore the knight still kneeling. go brave heart and save me from despair. ha says the captain and a tremendous fight began. cried jo aside. said the old woman. continued laurie promptly. the knight in whom im interested went back to find the pretty face and learned that the princesses had spun themselves free and all gone and married but one. said he. i cant come to you it isnt proper said she as sweet as honey. he tried to climb over the hedge but it seemed to grow higher and higher. let me in but the pretty princess did not seem to understand for she picked her roses quietly and left him to fight his way in. beth had disappeared behind jo and grace was asleep. with practice we might do something quite clever. said fred. asked jo. said sallie. from fred. her turn came next. said laurie. asked sallie. said laurie. asked sallie. now miss sallie you shall have a chance without waiting to draw. asked fred. asked jo. inquired mr. brooke breaking an awkward pause. asked miss kate with a look of surprise. if she had seen the brown eyes then she would have stopped short but she never looked up and the lesson was not spoiled for her. i dont like my work but i get a good deal of satisfaction out of it after all so i wont complain. exclaimed meg. asked grace curiously. laughed grace. my heart what shall i do he whispered under cover of a lively chorus. thought laurie opening his sleepy eyes to take a good look for there was something rather peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors. all walked quietly through the garden out at the little back gate and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and river. they cant be going in the boat for they havent got the key. perhaps they forgot it. though possessed of half a dozen hats it took him some time to find one then there was a hunt for the key which was at last discovered in his pocket so that the girls were quite out of sight when he leaped the fence and ran after them. he asked advancing slowly. bring on your bears. asked meg of her sisters. said jo. i give you my word i wont laugh. demanded jo. i wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away and he was rather dismal. well we have tried not to waste our holiday but each has had a task and worked at it with a will. said laurie softly for he was quick to see and feel beauty of any kind. said jo after a little pause. asked meg. thats my favorite castle. i am to be mistress of it and manage it as i like with plenty of servants so i never need work a bit. how i should enjoy it asked laurie. every one of us but beth wants to be rich and famous and gorgeous in every respect. muttered laurie with an impatient sigh. said jo. cried laurie sitting up with sudden energy. he wants me to be an india merchant as he was and id rather be shot. going to college ought to satisfy him for if i give him four years he ought to let me off from the business. but hes set and ive got to do just as he did unless i break away and please myself as my father did. you mustnt talk in that way and laurie mustnt take your bad advice. as you say there is no one else to stay with and love him and youd never forgive yourself if you left him without his permission. said laurie heartily as meg paused looking flushed and earnest with her story. he thought she was just perfect and talked about it for days and days and went on about you all in flaming style. so you keep an account of my good and bad marks in brookes face do you dont be angry and oh dont tell him i said anything you are so kind to us we feel as if you were our brother and say just what we think. and meg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid. im cross and have been out of sorts all day. asked laurie. jos desk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall. having found the place with some difficulty she went into the doorway looked up the dirty stairs and after standing stock still a minute suddenly dived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she came. on returning for the third time jo gave herself a shake pulled her hat over her eyes and walked up the stairs looking as if she were going to have all her teeth out. when she saw the young gentleman she looked anything but pleased and passed him with a nod. mother wont let us have him at our house though he wants to come. asked laurie anxiously. just be a simple honest respectable boy and well never desert you. i dont know what i should do if you acted like mr. kings son. he asked presently. all about people you know and such fun you get everything you want out of people. its ridiculous it wont be allowed. my patience it was capital but see what a guy its made me. how could you dont try to make me grow up before my time meg. its hard enough to have you change all of a sudden. it was very splendid and they have gone to spend the winter in paris. said laurie. asked meg looking surprised. asked beth wondering why jo kept her face behind the sheet. and a long breath jo began to read very fast. asked beth who had caught a glimpse of jos face. cried meg dropping her work. i knew it dear me how delighted they all were to be sure how meg wouldnt believe it till she saw the words. how proud mrs. march was when she knew it. so i let him have the two stories and today this was sent to me and laurie caught me with it and insisted on seeing it so i let him. cried jo. its a dull day but the air isnt bad and im going to take brooke home so it will be gay inside if it isnt out. asked laurie leaning over mrs. marchs chair with the affectionate look and tone he always gave her. a sharp ring interrupted her and a minute after hannah came in with a letter. laurie dashed downstairs for water while meg and hannah supported her and jo read aloud in a frightened voice...
    mrs. march
    your husband is very ill.  come at once. they tried to be calm poor things as their mother sat up looking pale but steady and put away her grief to think and plan for them. she asked presently when she had collected her thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done. the next train goes early in the morning. the horses are ready. mrs. marchs warning was evidently thrown away for five minutes later laurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse riding as if for his life. on the way get these things. beth go and ask mr. laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine. im not too proud to beg for father. he shall have the best of everything. there was nothing he didnt offer from his own dressing gown to himself as escort. but the last was impossible. mother will accept im sure and it will be such a relief to know that she has someone to take care of her. mrs.
march put the note in the fire the money in her purse and went on with her preparations with her lips folded tightly in a way which jo would have understood if she had been there. the short afternoon wore away. twentyfive dollars it will be good for my vanity i was getting too proud of my wig. asked amy who would as soon have thought of cutting off her head as her pretty hair. the work put into it made it dear and so on. it was getting late and i was afraid if it wasnt done right away that i shouldnt have it done at all and you know when i start to do a thing i hate to give it up. so i begged him to take it and told him why i was in such a hurry. asked amy who liked to have things explained as they went along. how friendly such things make strangers feel dont they asked meg with a shiver. i will confess though i felt queer when i saw the dear old hair laid out on the table and felt only the short rough ends of my head. it almost seemed as if id an arm or leg off. the woman saw me look at it and picked out a long lock for me to keep. they kissed her quietly and went to bed as silently as if the dear invalid lay in the next room. beth and amy soon fell asleep in spite of the great trouble but meg lay awake thinking the most serious thoughts she had ever known in her short life. its only the vain part of me that goes and cries in this silly way. dont tell anyone its all over now. i have no fears for you yet i am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly. the rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen. that was the hard minute but the girls stood it well. they kissed their mother quietly clung about her tenderly and tried to wave their hands cheerfully when she drove away. whispered mrs.
march as she kissed one dear little face after the other and hurried into the carriage. i shall go to aunt march as usual. said jo waving her hat with a grateful face. my dearest mother
it is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us for the news was so good we couldnt help laughing and crying over it. the girls are all as good as gold. amy minds me nicely and i take great care of her. hannah is a perfect saint. we are all well and busy but we long day and night to have you back. didnt that do as well as a regular prayer for i felt a great many in my heart. she gets prettier every day and im in love with her sometimes. oh i must tell you that i came near having a quarrel with laurie. i freed my mind about a silly little thing and he was offended. i was right but didnt speak as i ought and he marched home saying he wouldnt come again till i begged pardon. i declared i wouldnt and got mad. it lasted all day. i felt bad and wanted you very much. laurie and i are both so proud its hard to beg pardon. but i thought hed come to it for i was in the right. he didnt come and just at night i remembered what you said when amy fell into the river. i read my little book felt better resolved not to let the sun set on my anger and ran over to tell laurie i was sorry. i met him at the gate coming for the same thing. we both laughed begged each others pardon and felt all good and comfortable again. then out in the free fresh air they swing     under the sunny sky. then on the earth there would be indeed     a glorious washing day the busy mind has no time to think     of sorrow or care or gloom. i read every morning try to be good all day and sing myself to sleep with fathers tune. everyone is very kind and we are as happy as we can be without you. amy wants the rest of the page so i must stop. kiss dear father on the cheek he calls mine. the sleeves of my blue dress were all worn out and meg put in new ones but the full front came wrong and they are more blue than the dress. cant she the girls is clever and fly round right smart. beth and my boy report daily. hannah is a model servant and guards pretty meg like a dragon. glad the fine weather holds. dont let your husband want anything. all were unconscious that this experience was a test of character and when the first excitement was over felt that they had done well and deserved praise. said beth ten days after mrs. marchs departure. asked beth. asked meg. beth spoke earnestly and meg promised she would go tomorrow. an hour passed. it was late when she came back and no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into her mothers room. cried jo as beth put out her hand as if to warn her off and asked quickly. . . it seemed asleep but all of a sudden if gave a little cry and trembled and then lay very still. exclaimed jo seizing the book and feeling that washington was an immense way off. she never had it and i should hate to give it to her. asked beth anxiously. dont care if i do. no dont cry but hear what a jolly plan ive got. you go to aunt marchs and ill come and take you out every day driving or walking and well have capital times. change of air and care will keep you well i dare say or if it does not entirely you will have the fever more lightly. the babys death troubled her but i dare say she has only got cold. asked jo. aunt march received them with her usual hospitality. laurie retired to the window and jo told her story. amy can stay and make herself useful if she isnt sick which ive no doubt she will be looks like it now. in such a funny way that she laughed instead. well that wont last long i fancy. and jo youd better go at once. laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost and mr. laurence locked the grand piano because he could not bear to be reminded of the young neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him. everyone missed beth. she longed for her cats but would not have them brought lest they should get sick and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about jo. cried laurie with a startled face. she doesnt look like my beth and theres nobody to help us bear it. soon she dried the tears which had relieved her and looked up with a grateful face. now she wont feel so bad about leaving him. oh me beth is my conscience and i cant give her up. i cant stop a bit. you are a good doctor teddy and such a comfortable friend. oh mother laurie though decidedly amazed behaved with great presence of mind. i didnt mean to it was dreadful of me but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of hannah that i couldnt help flying at you. shed never forgive us if beth...  well if anything happened you know. while laurie departed feeling that he had made a rather neat thing of it. every one rejoiced but beth. the doctor had been in to say that some change for better or worse would probably take place about midnight at which time he would return. weary hannah slept on and no one but the sisters saw the pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed. an hour went by and nothing happened except lauries quiet departure for the station. it was past two when jo who stood at the window thinking how dreary the world looked in its winding sheet of snow heard a movement by the bed and turning quickly saw meg kneeling before their mothers easy chair with her face hidden. she was back at her post in an instant and to her excited eyes a great change seemed to have taken place. praise be given cried jo starting to her feet. then she must dust the room and what a trying job that was. then she was allowed one hour for exercise or play and didnt she enjoy it after dinner she had to read aloud and sit still while the old lady slept which she usually did for an hour as she dropped off over the first page. ah no asked amy. asked amy who in her loneliness felt the need of help of some sort and found that she was apt to forget her little book now that beth was not there to remind her of it. amy liked the idea and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next her room hoping it would do her good. but i wish shed let us have them now. oh ill be a lamb if i can only have that lovely ring she tried to forget herself to keep cheerful and be satisfied with doing right though no one saw or praised her for it. get along you fright hold your tongue kiss me dear ha catch her catch her and now having disposed of my most valuable property i hope all will be satisfied and not blame the dead. she felt so ill one day that she told jo she wanted to give her piano to meg her cats to you and the poor old doll to jo who would love it for her sake. she was sorry she had so little to give and left locks of hair to the rest of us and her best love to grandpa. laurie added it smiling at amys last and greatest sacrifice. what a strange yet pleasant day that was. so brilliant and gay without for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow. there are a good many hard times in this life of ours but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right way. the womans face is not good its too beautiful for me to draw but the baby is done better and i love it very much. aunt gave me the ring today. she called me to her and kissed me and put it on my finger and said i was a credit to her and shed like to keep me always. asked her mother laughing. amy looked so earnest and sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing and listened respectfully to the little plan. beth isnt selfish and thats the reason everyone loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her. people wouldnt feel so bad about me if i was sick and i dont deserve to have them but id like to be loved and missed by a great many friends so im going to try and be like beth all i can. wear your ring dear and do your best. now i must go back to beth. asked mrs. march holding out her hand with a face which invited confidence. speak low and tell me all about it. asked mrs. march rather sharply. we forgot about it till teddy told me that mr. brooke owned that he liked meg but didnt dare say so she was so young and he so poor. asked mrs. march with an anxious look. now meg does not do anything of the sort. cried jo staring. i know youll take his part. hes been good to father and you wont send him away but let meg marry him if she wants to. mean thing john went with me at mr. laurences request and was so devoted to poor father that we couldnt help getting fond of him. he only wanted our leave to love her and work for her and the right to make her love him if he could. i felt it and now its worse than i imagined. i see it all meg will be absorbed and no good to me any more. oh dear me mrs. march sighed and jo looked up with an air of relief. im glad of it. your father and i have agreed that she shall not bind herself in any way nor be married before twenty. if she and john love one another they can wait and test the love by doing so. asked jo looking up with a brighter face. dont make plans jo but let time and their own hearts mate your friends. asked meg as she crept into the room with the finished letter in her hand. im going to bed. asked meg smiling with her innocent eyes looking down into her mothers. good night mother dear. meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was absorbed in preparations for her fathers return but all of a sudden a change seemed to come over her and for a day or two she was quite unlike herself. she started when spoken to blushed when looked at was very quiet and sat over her sewing with a timid troubled look on her face. how odd mrs. march and jo were deep in their own affairs when a sound from meg made them look up to see her staring at her note with a frightened face. cried her mother running to her while jo tried to take the paper which had done the mischief. and meg hid her face in her hands crying as if her heart were quite broken. ive done nothing cried jo bewildered. jo hardly heard her for she and her mother were reading the note which was written in a peculiar hand. mr. laurence will help me to some good place and then my sweet girl you will make me happy. thats the way he meant to pay me for keeping my word to mother. said jo so earnestly that they believed her. cried mrs. march quickly. and meg hid her face again overcome with shame. and jo made for the door again. let me handle this for it is worse than i thought. asked mrs. march. tell on meg. ill comfort meg while you go and get laurie. away ran jo and mrs. march gently told meg mr. brookes real feelings. the sound of voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour but what happened during that interview the girls never knew. called out the young gentleman in a threatening tone. jo immediately knocked again. could i ask whats the matter demanded jo. sighed jo. let it pass and ill explain what i can. ill go to washington and see brooke. why not you go and surprise your father and ill stir up old brooke. it would be a glorious joke. lets do it jo. well leave a letter saying we are all right and trot off at once. ive got money enough. for a moment jo looked as if she would agree for wild as the plan was it just suited her. cried jo covering her ears. asked jo seriously. asked the old gentleman looking grim and vexed but trying not to show it. dont try to shield him. i know he has been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home. out with it jo. laurie has confessed asked pardon and been punished quite enough. please dont. it was partly my fault but its all right now. was the sharp answer. jo was sorry for that speech the minute it was made. jo fancied he remembered and regretted the past and she wished she had held her tongue. she laughed as she spoke and mr. laurence looked relieved evidently taking the whole as a joke. wheres your respect for me and your proper bringing up bless the boys and girls he feels badly because you didnt believe him when he said he couldnt tell. he says he wont come down till he has one and talks about washington and goes on in an absurd way. try it. he likes fun and this way is better than talking. the note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to another after offering some deep insult. he added laughing. i got it all round. everyone thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over but the mischief was done for though others forgot it meg remembered. may nothing you dismay     but health and peace and happiness     be yours this christmas day. heres fruit to feed our busy bee     and flowers for her nose. half an hour after everyone had said they were so happy they could only hold one drop more the drop came. laurie opened the parlor door and popped his head in very quietly. but it was too late. it was not at all romantic but a hearty laugh set everybody straight again for hannah was discovered behind the door sobbing over the fat turkey which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the kitchen. also why mrs. march gently nodded her head and asked rather abruptly if he wouldnt like to have something to eat. there never was such a christmas dinner as they had that day. a sleigh ride had been planned but the girls would not leave their father so the guests departed early and as twilight gathered the happy family sat together round the fire. asked jo breaking a short pause which had followed a long conversation about many things. asked jo. cried meg who sat beside him. he laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite with an unusually mild expression in her face. asked jo when amy had thanked her father and told about her ring. he that is down need fear no fall     he that is low no pride. he that is humble ever shall     have god to be his guide. i am content with what i have     little be it or much. and lord but something was needed and the elder ones felt it though none confessed the fact. mr. and mrs. march looked at one another with an anxious expression as their eyes followed meg. said meg laughing and trying to look unconscious. i see it and so does mother. you are not like your old self a bit and seem ever so far away from me. asked jo more respectfully. meg spoke as if to herself and glanced out at the lane where she had often seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight. i dont believe youll ever say it and i know he wont be satisfied if you do. and mr. brooke looked so hurt that meg thought she must have done something very rude. she blushed up to the little curls on her forehead for he had never called her margaret before and she was surprised to find how natural and sweet it seemed to hear him say it. i only want to know if you care for me a little meg. this was the moment for the calm proper speech but meg didnt make it. . poor mr. brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling about his ears for he had never seen meg in such a mood before and it rather bewildered him. he asked anxiously following her as she walked away. i dont want to be worried about such things. ill wait and say nothing till you have had more time. dont play with me meg. the family were all busy in the back part of the house and she had made her way quietly in hoping to surprise them. she did surprise two of them so much that meg started as if she had seen a ghost and mr. brooke vanished into the study. ah i understand now. i know all about it. hell hear. said meg much troubled. ive something to say to you and i must free my mind at once. tell me do you mean to marry this cook if you do not one penny of my money ever goes to you. is that the way you take my advice miss aunt march put on her glasses and took a look at the girl for she did not know her in this new mood. i mean it kindly and dont want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake at the beginning. you ought to marry well and help your family. we are willing to work and we mean to wait. aunt march was very angry for she had set her heart on having her pretty niece make a fine match and something in the girls happy young face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour. no i wont stop. im disappointed in you and havent spirits to see your father now. dont expect anything from me when you are married. your mr.
brookes friends must take care of you. at the odd sound the lovers turned and saw her. how much has happened since i said that asked amy who was in a hurry for the wedding. im not good for much i know but ill stand by you jo all the days of my life. and laurie meant what he said. its all right you see. meg is happy brooke will fly round and get settled immediately grandpa will attend to him and it will be very jolly to see meg in her own little house. well have capital times after she is gone for i shall be through college before long and then well go abroad on some nice trip or other. dont you wish you could take a look forward and see where we shall all be then amy was drawing the lovers who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own the light of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not copy. so the curtain falls upon meg jo beth and amy. the three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the quiet family. that was the name of the little brown house mr. brooke had prepared for megs first home. it was a tiny house with a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a pocket handkerchief in the front. but inside it was altogether charming and the happy bride saw no fault from garret to cellar. brooke came home. in vain meg begged him to stop. its a great mistake for young girls like meg to leave themselves nothing to do but dress give orders and gossip. all three laughed as meg spoke for that linen closet was a joke. and meg looked quite contented as well she might. bless you beth asked meg anxiously. i say jo how is grandpa this week asked jo rather sharply. and laurie stopped short with an injured air. i have enough all through the week and like to enjoy myself when i come home. we dont want any more marrying in this family for years to come. im not one of the agreeable sort. im too busy to be worried with nonsense and i think its dreadful to break up families so. now dont say any more about it. meg looked very like a rose herself for all that was best and sweetest in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day making it fair and tender with a charm more beautiful than beauty. neither silk lace nor orange flowers would she have. there is a fresh color in her brown cheeks a soft shine in her eyes and only gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today. beth has grown slender pale and more quiet than ever. im too happy to care what anyone says or thinks and im going to have my little wedding just as i like it. and turning gave it with her heart on her lips. everybody cleared up after that and said something brilliant or tried to which did just as well for laughter is ready when hearts are light. i give you my word for it. thank you all for my happy wedding day. replied her mother in whose eyes the stately young lady still remained the baby. what do you want for lunch asked her mother beginning to look sober. and away went amy to lay her plan before her sisters. i do and i mean to make the most of every chance that comes. to begin with hannahs cooking didnt turn out well. beth got a cold and took to her bed. ill go onto the porch and meet them. not a golden penny exactly but i doubt if half a million would have given more real happiness then did the little sum that came to her in this wise. they did not always venture even to ask this question but took an observation of the cap and judged accordingly. asked jo with sudden interest. for a minute she stared at it as if it had been a snake then she read her letter and began to cry. jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction and ceased to envy richer girls taking great comfort in the knowledge that she could supply her own wants and need ask no one for a penny. he knows what will sell and we dont. make a good popular book and get as much money as you can. her mother thought that there was a trifle too much description. tisnt they were very happy even after they discovered that they couldnt live on love alone. i shall always be prepared. how charming that was to be sure but although they had had company from time to time it never happened to be unexpected and meg had never had an opportunity to distinguish herself till now. now it was not only shut but locked and yesterdays mud still adorned the steps. in the kitchen reigned confusion and despair. ive been at it till im all worn out. dont cry. i can bear anything better than that. i never thought of asking leave when you have always told me to do as i liked. take him away at once. i meant to dine at mothers. were both as hungry as hunters so we shant mind what it is. give us the cold meat and bread and cheese. i wont have anything of the sort in my house. i wont see him and you two can laugh at me and my jelly as much as you like. unfortunately john didnt come not seeing the matter in that light. no by george it wasnt it was hard upon her when she tried so heartily to please me. she was wrong of course but then she was young. neither spoke. never deceive him by look or word meg and he will give you the confidence you deserve the support you need. be careful be very careful not to wake his anger against yourself for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect. these words came back to meg as she sat sewing in the sunset especially the last. she glanced at him with tears in her eyes but he did not see them. she went very slowly across the room for pride was hard to swallow and stood by him but he did not turn his head. of course that settled it. forgive me dear. it was pleasant for in dull weather meg often felt lonely. seeing sallies pretty things made her long for such and pity herself because she had not got them. she knew her husbands income and she loved to feel that he trusted her not only with his happiness but what some men seem to value more his money. a few days before she had done a dreadful thing and it weighed upon her conscience. that was only a month to wait and here was a lovely violet silk going at a bargain and she had the money if she only dared to take it. that was the question. when john got out his books that night megs heart sank and for the first time in her married life she was afraid of her husband. the kind brown eyes looked as if they could be stern and though he was unusually merry she fancied he had found her out but didnt mean to let her know it. the little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him. i wont beat you if you have got a pair of killing boots. thought meg with a shiver. . . i dont mean to waste your money and i didnt think those little things would count up so. if he had scolded her or even shaken her it would not have broken her heart like those few words. i didnt mean it it was dreadful and the worst of it was john went on so quietly afterward just as if nothing had happened except that he stayed in town later and worked at night when she had gone to cry herself to sleep. next day she put her pride in her pocket went to sallie told the truth and asked her to buy the silk as a favor. where is everybody began laurie in a loud whisper. id rather not. isnt it fun are they boys what are you going to name them lets have another look. besides one has blue eyes and one brown. im neat and cool and comfortable quite proper for a dusty walk on a warm day. if people care more for my clothes than they do for me i dont wish to see them. you can dress for both and be as elegant as you please. im sure its no pleasure to me to go today but its a debt we owe society and theres no one to pay it but you and me. ill do anything for you jo if youll only dress yourself nicely and come and help me do the civil. i dont know which is the most absurd. well ill go if i must and do my best. now put on all your best things and ill tell you how to behave at each place so that you will make a good impression. i want people to like you and they would if youd only try to be a little more agreeable. do your hair the pretty way and put the pink rose in your bonnet. its becoming and you look too sober in your plain suit. take your light gloves and the embroidered handkerchief. theres one thing you can do well jo that is wear a shawl. i cant but its very nice to see you and im so glad aunt march gave you that lovely one. i merely meant you to be properly dignified and composed and you made yourself a perfect stock and stone. but what could she do asked one of the laughing gentlemen who enjoyed the subject. there was no one to bring the horse to the saddle so she took the saddle to the horse. cried miss lamb who found jo great fun. theres nothing the child cant do. goodby dear do come and see us. asked jo with a satisfied air as they walked away. the boys are at home and well have a comfortable time. it might have been worse but amy considered it bad. we cant agree about that for you belong to the old set and i to the new. i like your grateful spirit my dear. better for us that we cannot as a general thing but now and then it would be such a comfort such a saving of time and temper. wouldnt you like the flower table but everything seemed against her. it was late and she was tired. there was great indignation at home when she told her story that evening. her mother said it was a shame but told her she had done right. beth declared she wouldnt go to the fair at all and jo demanded why she didnt take all her pretty things and leave those mean people to get on without her. i hate such things and though i think ive a right to be hurt i dont intend to show it. the table was just complete then. i was just thinking id offer to put them back for they belong to your table rather than mine. cried one girl. now that was hard. it was a very long day and a hard one for amy as she sat behind her table often quite alone for the little girls deserted very soon. returned jo leaning over the gate to watch for laurie. they are just as much yours as mine. half of some of your things wouldnt suit me at all. as she passed the art table she glanced over it for her sisters things but saw no sign of them. i only did as id be done by. a week later amy did get her reward and poor jo found it hard to be delighted. shes too young its my turn first. ive wanted it so long. it would do me so much good and be so altogether splendid. amy has all the fun and i have all the work. said jo with a sigh. however we dont mean to stay long so its no great matter. oh i cant begin to tell you how i enjoy it all everyone was very kind to me especially the officers. dont laugh jo gentlemen really are very necessary aboard ship to hold on to or to wait upon one and as they have nothing to do its a mercy to make them useful otherwise they would smoke themselves to death im afraid. i wish beth could have come it would have done her so much good. i never shall forget it. its a dirty noisy place and i was glad to leave it. wasnt that fun girls i like traveling. i never shall get to london if i dont hurry. this is the way we went on. aunt mary got me some new things for i came off in such a hurry i wasnt half ready. i laid in a stock but shall get my gloves in paris. doesnt that sound sort of elegant and rich its very late but i cant let my letter go in the morning without telling you what happened last evening. who do you think came in as we were at tea i was so surprised for i shouldnt have known them but for the cards. they had heard from laurie where we were to be and came to ask us to their house but uncle wont go so we shall return the call and see them as we can. tell beth frank asked for her and was sorry to hear of her ill health. neither of them had forgotten camp laurence or the fun we had there. what ages ago it seems doesnt it well we were hardly settled here when he turned up again saying he had come for a holiday and was going to switzerland. aunt looked sober at first but he was so cool about it she couldnt say a word. and now we get on nicely and are very glad he came for he speaks french like a native and i dont know what we should do without him. such delightful times as we are having ill talk for hours about them when i come but havent time to write. fred wanted to get me some but of course i didnt allow it. i havent words beautiful enough to describe it. im afraid im going to have trouble with that boy it begins to look like it. he needs someone to look after him when frank is not with him. kate said once she hoped hed marry soon and i quite agree with her that it would be well for him. it was very lovely but i should have enjoyed it more if i had known the story better. i didnt like to ask as everyone knew it or pretended they did. i wish jo would tell me all about it. now comes the serious part for it happened here and fred has just gone. he has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite fond of him. i cant help it if people like me. i like him and we get on comfortably together. ive seen the plate the family jewels the old servants and pictures of the country place with its park great house lovely grounds and fine horses. oh it would be all i should ask and id rather have it than any title such as girls snap up so readily and find nothing behind. one of us must marry well. you may be sure of that and though fred is not my model hero he does very well and in time i should get fond enough of him if he was very fond of me and let me do just as i liked. so ive been turning the matter over in my mind the last week for it was impossible to help seeing that fred liked me. he said nothing but little things showed it. i had a feeling that something was going to happen and i was ready for it. he looked so troubled that i forgot all about myself and asked what the matter was. he said hed just got a letter begging him to come home for frank was very ill.  so he was going at once on the night train and only had time to say goodby. of course this is all very private but i wished you to know what was going on. send me as much advice as you like. ill use it if i can. love and trust me. i found her crying over the babies the other day. i always feel strong when you are at home now meg is gone. she said sitting down in her own room pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had just made. what will mother say he must. things were in this state when the grand discovery was made and jo watched laurie that night as she had never done before. if she had not got the new idea into her head she would have seen nothing unusual in the fact that beth was very quiet and laurie very kind to her. but where should she go if the sausage as they called it stood on end it was a sign that he might approach and repose but if it lay flat across the sofa woe to man woman or child who dared disturb it have you shes engaged. between ourselves jo some of the girls i know really do go on at such a rate im ashamed of them. the pretty modest girls are never talked about except respectfully among gentleman. bless your innocent soul and jo looked a little queer likewise for a name had almost escaped her. i shall be better soon. and her mother looked up quickly as if the words suggested a double meaning. i feel restless and anxious to be seeing doing and learning more than i am. i had a bright idea yesterday and this is it. her family is separate from the rest and no one knows me there. dont care if they do. jo looked up and jo looked down then said slowly with sudden color in her cheeks. and mrs. march looked anxious as she put the question. im glad you think he is only beginning to care for me. he hasnt said anything but he looks a great deal. meg is so and i am content with her success. amy is my chief care now but her good sense will help her. by the way she seems brighter this last day or two. have you spoken to her mrs. march shook her head and did not take so romantic a view of the case but looked grave and repeated her opinion that for lauries sake jo should go away for a time. beth must think im going to please myself as i am for i cant talk about laurie to her. but she can pet and comfort him after im gone and so cure him of this romantic notion. when all was settled with fear and trembling she told laurie but to her surprise he took it very quietly. asked beth. she gave me a funny little sky parlor all she had but there is a stove in it and a nice table in a sunny window so i can sit here and write whenever i like. my rooms are always open to you and your own shall be as comfortable as i can make it. come to me if anything goes wrong and be as happy as you can. as i went downstairs soon after i saw something i liked. wasnt it good of him there is a glass door between it and the nursery and i mean to peep at him and then ill tell you how he looks. professor bhaer was there and while he arranged his books i took a good look at him. i was just going to run when i caught sight of a morsel of a child carrying a big book and stopped to see what was going on. i fancy he has a hard life of it. i hate ordinary people i picked up a few bits of news and was introduced to the professor. she spoke to me at dinner today for i went to table again its such fun to watch people and asked me to come and see her at her room. she has fine books and pictures knows interesting persons and seems friendly so i shall make myself agreeable for i do want to get into good society only it isnt the same sort that amy likes. i promised i would and he departed but it seems as if i was doomed to see a good deal of him for today as i passed his door on my way out by accident i knocked against it with my umbrella. pray forward amys as soon as you can spare them. take good care of him for me beth and tell me all about the babies and give heaps of love to everyone. from your faithful jo. bless you we are very good friends now and ive begun to take lessons. i went in and while we worked i looked about me for it was a den to be sure. nothing was said and i hoped he wouldnt find it out but one day last week he caught me at it. we will make the time and we fail not to find the sense. of course i couldnt say anything after that and as it really is a splendid opportunity i made the bargain and we began. now we go well my turn. i like it very much and he doesnt seem tired of it yet which is very good of him isnt it i mean to give him something on christmas for i dare not offer money. im not jealous dear do your best only dont make a saint of him. read him bits of my letters. i havent time to write much and that will do just as well. i cant tell you how much i enjoyed your christmas bundle for i didnt get it till night and had given up hoping. the things were just what i wanted and all the better for being made instead of bought. thank you all heaps and heaps now dont laugh at his horrid name. im glad you both like what i tell you about him and hope you will know him some day. mother would admire his warm heart father his wise head. i was so glad of that. i didnt mean to go down having no dress. bless you all i wished to see mr. and mr. dashwood gave jo a quick look which seemed to take note of everything she had on from the bow in her bonnet to the buttons on her boots. which was not quite a correct statement by the way. cant promise to take it. in a careless tone. the tale will be out next week. one thing disturbed her satisfaction and that was that she did not tell them at home. it was easy to keep her secret for no name appeared with her stories. mr. dashwood had of course found it out very soon but promised to be dumb and for a wonder kept his word. why everybody liked him was what puzzled jo at first. there were lines upon his forehead but time seemed to have touched him gently remembering how kind he was to others. they looked as if they were at ease and liked to make him comfortable. from her jo learned it and liked it all the better because mr. bhaer had never told it. somehow as he talked the world got right again to jo. . . said jo. they are not for children to see  nor young people to read. she had betrayed herself however by a look and a blush for though an absent man the professor saw a good deal more than people fancied. now it occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own and it troubled him. i do not think that good young girls should see such things. if the respectable people knew what harm they did they would not feel that the living was honest. but when nothing remained of all her three months work except a heap of ashes and the money in her lap jo looked sober as she sat on the floor wondering what she ought to do about her wages. everyone seemed sorry when the time came. he asked looking down at her with an eager expression which she did not see. he said in an altered tone. jo looked up then quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure in the prospect of showing them to one another. she didnt know what would have become of her. cried laurie as soon as he was within speaking distance. then he walked more slowly suddenly lost his fine flow of language and now and then a dreadful pause occurred. ive tried to show it but you wouldnt let me. it was like you but it was no use. he stopped short and caught both her hands as he put his question with a look that she did not soon forget. i wish you wouldnt take it so hard i cant help it. she asked wondering at his violence. demanded jo thinking he must mean his grandfather. he isnt old nor anything bad but good and kind and the best friend ive got next to you. pray dont fly into a passion. ive tried and failed and i wont risk our happiness by such a serious experiment. i dont want to take what you call a sensible view. it wont help me and it only makes it harder. grandpa has set his heart upon it your people like it and i cant get on without you. say you will and lets be happy. not until months afterward did jo understand how she had the strength of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided that she did not love her boy and never could. it was very hard to do but she did it knowing that delay was both useless and cruel. i shouldnt. broke in laurie. cried jo losing patience with poor teddy. she cried for his face frightened her. i wish hed love beth perhaps he may in time but i begin to think i was mistaken about her. oh dear how can girls like to have lovers and refuse them he bore it as long as he could then went to his piano and began to play. just what laurie longed to say with a different meaning and he shook off his grandfathers hands with an impatient motion for though grateful for the sympathy his mans pride could not bear a mans pity. im disappointed but the girl cant help it and the only thing left for you to do is to go away for a time. and laurie walked fast through the room with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see. stopping to listen. now my dear boy just sit quietly down and hear my plan. and laurie sat down without a sign of interest in face or voice. i meant you should attend to it but i can do it better myself and things here will get on very well with brooke to manage them. i quite enjoy the idea. i go because i think youd feel happier than if i was left behind. ive friends in london and paris and should like to visit them. i give you entire liberty but i trust you to make an honest use of it. jo followed a minute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round. that was all except a little pause. jo saw and felt it but said nothing at the time and soon the first impression lost much of its power for beth seemed happy no one appeared to doubt that she was better and presently in other cares jo for a time forgot her fear. beth was too shy to enjoy society and jo too wrapped up in her to care for anyone else. jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her heart and beths but when she put out her hand to lift it up there seemed something sacred in the silence and she waited for beth to speak. she wondered and was thankful also that her parents did not seem to see what she saw and during the quiet weeks when the shadows grew so plain to her she said nothing of it to those at home believing that it would tell itself when beth came back no better. one day beth told her. there was no answer except her sisters cheek against her own not even tears for when most deeply moved jo did not cry. i tried to think it was a sick fancy and would not let it trouble anyone. i wasnt sure no one said anything and i hoped i was mistaken. he is so good to me how can i help it but he could never be anything to me but my brother. i dont care what becomes of anybody but you beth. i try but every day i lose a little and feel more sure that i shall never gain it back. i cant let you go. ill work and pray and fight against it. ill keep you in spite of everything. there must be ways it cant be too late. beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life and cheerfully wait for death. if they dont see it you will tell them for me. but beth i dont give up yet. said jo trying to speak cheerfully. i only mean to say that i have a feeling that it never was intended i should live long. im not like the rest of you. i never made any plans about what id do when i grew up. i never thought of being married as you all did. i never wanted to go away and the hard part now is the leaving you all. it came quite close to beth and looked at her with a friendly eye and sat upon a warm stone dressing its wet feathers quite at home. beth smiled and felt comforted for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship and remind her that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed. see jo how tame it is. dear little girl it wont do any good. im sure of that. we wont be miserable but enjoy being together while we wait. she was right. there was no need of any words when they got home for father and mother saw plainly now what they had prayed to be saved from seeing. tired with her short journey beth went at once to bed saying how glad she was to be home and when jo went down she found that she would be spared the hard task of telling beths secret. along this walk on christmas day a tall young man walked slowly with his hands behind him and a somewhat absent expression of countenance. he stared a minute then his whole face woke up and waving his hat like a boy he hurried forward to meet her. when did you come get in and we can talk at our ease. i was going for a drive and longing for company. there are many americans there and they give it in honor of the day. youll go with us of course now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass. its going to the church of st. while amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered crumbs to the brilliant birds laurie looked at her as she had looked at him with a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had wrought. said amy feeling in good spirits and anxious to see him so also. time and absence had done its work on both the young people. amy knew her good points and made the most of them with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and pretty woman. said laurie with the look of satisfaction she liked to see in his eyes when they rested on her. he asked touching a fold of her dress that had blown over his knee. but three months passed and there was no return of repose. asked her mother anxiously. speak to me as if i were little meg again. if i ask him to stay hell think im jealous and i wouldnt insult him by such an idea. besides you owe something to john as well as to the babies. his place is there as well as yours and the children need him. when you and jo were little i went on just as you are feeling as if i didnt do my duty unless i devoted myself wholly to you. i struggled along as well as i could but jo was too much for me. that is the secret of our home happiness. then id do what i have often proposed let hannah come and help you. you need the exercise hannah would enjoy the rest and john would find his wife again. then id try to take an interest in whatever john likes talk with him let him read to you exchange ideas and help each other in that way. poor john and no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years of the little lives given to them to train. now dear goodby. meg did think it over found it good and acted upon it though the first attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it. and demi shut his eyes tight as if to catch sleep and hurry the desired day. you must go to bed and not trouble poor mamma. you have made a slave of yourself long enough. give him one lesson and then there will be an end of it. i really need some music to put me in tune. you have been shut up so long it will do you no end of good and i shall enjoy it of all things. never mind what john said or what a very narrow escape the little bonnet had from utter ruin. i preferred to stay at home and write letters. and amy looked severe. that satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry her lately. and he glanced up with a decided expression of interest in his eyes. dont you hear often he asked changing the subject abruptly after another pause in which he had been wondering if amy knew his secret and wanted to talk about it. i want to be great or nothing. you arent woman of the world enough yet to hide your feelings my dear. queens of society cant get on without money so you mean to make a good match and start in that way its lazy laurence. at any rate you are none the better for it as far as i can see. i said when we first met that you had improved. now i take it all back for i dont think you half so nice as when i left you at home. with money talent position health and beauty ah you like that old vanity her keen eyes filled and when she spoke again it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to make it so. and jo wouldnt be kind to you that was no more than you ought to have done for your grandfathers sake. i dont pretend to be wise but i am observing and i see a great deal more than youd imagine. love jo all your days if you choose but dont let it spoil you for its wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you cant have the one you want. neither spoke for several minutes. but both felt ill at ease. asked amy as they parted at her aunts door. next morning instead of the usual call amy received a note which made her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end. they put away their grief and each did his or her part toward making that last year a happy one. john quietly set apart a little sum that he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with the fruit she loved and longed for. ah me and to feel that there was no help. shes fast asleep so i wont wake her to ask leave. henceforth safe across the river     i shall see forever more     a beloved household spirit     waiting for me on the shore. hope and faith born of my sorrow     guardian angels shall become     and the sister gone before me     by their hands shall lead me home. see i found this and read it. i knew you wouldnt care. and jos head went down upon the pillow beside her sisters. im not so good as you make me but i have tried to do right. you must take my place jo and be everything to father and mother when im gone. when morning came for the first time in many months the fire was out jos place was empty and the room was very still. he had always meant to do something and amys advice was quite unnecessary. he did not do much but he thought a great deal and was conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself. talent isnt genius and you cant make it so. that seemed a hard question to answer and laurie began to wish he had to work for his daily bread. he refused to believe it at first got angry with himself and couldnt understand it but these hearts of ours are curious and contrary things and time and nature work their will in spite of us. i havent forgotten i never can. couldnt she wouldnt she and let him come home and be happy she was wrapped up in beth and never wished to hear the word love again. then she begged him to be happy with somebody else but always keep a little corner of his heart for his loving sister jo. she ought to have made an effort and tried to love him. it couldnt be very hard many people would be proud and glad to have such a dear boy care for them. but jo never would act like other girls so there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat him like a brother. if all brothers were treated as well as laurie was at this period they would be a much happier race of beings than they are. poor old fellow while these changes were going on abroad trouble had come at home. if monsieur would give himself the pain of sitting down a flash of time should present her. he stood a minute looking at her with new eyes seeing what no one had ever seen before the tender side of amys character. he did not tell her so but she was not disappointed for both felt the truth were satisfied and gladly left the rest to silence. we wont talk about it now for it makes me cry and i want to enjoy you while you stay. in spite of the new sorrow it was a very happy time so happy that laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word. it took him a little while to recover from his surprise at the cure of his first and as he had firmly believed his last and only love. there was no need of having a scene hardly any need of telling amy that he loved her she knew it without words and had given him his answer long ago. it all came about so naturally that no one could complain and he knew that everybody would be pleased even jo. rest a little and let me row. very tenderly. some people seemed to get all sunshine and some all shadow. it was not fair for she tried more than amy to be good but never got any reward only disappointment trouble and hard work. for the time had come when they could talk together not only as father and daughter but as man and woman able and glad to serve each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love. jo had got so far she was learning to do her duty and to feel unhappy if she did not but to do it cheerfully ah that was another thing here was the task not what she had expected but better because self had no part in it. now could she do it write something for us and never mind the rest of the world. try it dear. she said quite bewildered. you wrote with no thoughts of fame and money and put your heart into it my daughter. you have had the bitter now comes the sweet. when amy and laurie wrote of their engagement mrs. march feared that jo would find it difficult to rejoice over it but her fears were soon set at rest for though jo looked grave at first she took it very quietly and was full of hopes and plans for the children before she read the letter twice. said jo as they laid down the closely written sheets and looked at one another. you may trust me. forgive me dear i cant help seeing that you are very lonely and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to my heart. but you are right in one thing. id no idea hearts could take in so many. a restless spirit possessed her and the old feeling came again not bitter as it once was but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one sister should have all she asked the other nothing. she had smiled at first then she looked thoughtful next sad and when she came to a little message written in the professors hand her lips began to tremble the books slid out of her lap and she sat looking at the friendly words as they took a new meaning and touched a tender spot in her heart. who shall say her face looked tired grave and rather sad for tomorrow was her birthday and she was thinking how fast the years went by how old she was getting and how little she seemed to have accomplished. almost twentyfive and nothing to show for it. jo was mistaken in that. there was a good deal to show and byandby she saw and was grateful for it. but its not as bad as it looks and one can get on quite happily if one has something in ones self to fall back upon. and looking at them with compassion not contempt girls in their bloom should remember that they too may miss the blossom time. cried jo for laurie uttered those two words with an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him. i couldnt wait. now start right and tell me how it all happened. amy did it to please you. but grandpa wanted to come home. my faith as i told you in my letter when i wrote that amy had been so kind to me i never shall stop loving you but the love is altered and i have learned to see that it is better as it is. amy and you changed places in my heart thats all. for it was one jo as you said and i found it out after making a fool of myself. upon my word i was so tumbled up in my mind at one time that i didnt know which i loved best you or amy and tried to love you both alike. but i couldnt and when i saw her in switzerland everything seemed to clear up all at once. the happy old times cant come back and we mustnt expect it. im sure you feel this. i see the change in you and youll find it in me. i shall miss my boy but i shall love the man as much and admire him more because he means to be what i hoped he would. you are older. heres a line and theres another. unless you smile your eyes look sad and when i touched the cushion just now i found a tear on it. youve had a great deal to bear and had to bear it all alone. i begin to feel quite young already for somehow all my troubles seemed to fly away when you came. he looked down at her wondering if she remembered the time but jo was smiling to herself as if in truth her troubles had all vanished at his coming. you look a little wicked now. she is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well. jo liked that and thought the new dignity very becoming but the boy seemed changing very fast into the man and regret mingled with her pleasure. amy and you never did quarrel as we used to. mercy on us how they did talk first one then the other then all burst out together trying to tell the history of three years in half an hour. my sister and friends have just come home and we are all very happy. he put the question abruptly for as jo hung up his coat the light fell on her face and he saw a change in it. everyone greeted him kindly for jos sake at first but very soon they liked him for his own. but it did not last long. he got interested in spite of himself and before he knew it was drawn into the circle. they were not all there. the little chair stood in its old place. she wondered what the business was that brought mr. bhaer to the city and finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor somewhere but had been too modest to mention the fact. i need something of the sort to keep me steady. asked mrs. march well pleased at lauries decision and the energy with which he spoke. and jo sighed then smiled brightly as professor bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push. how could i think so when you refused a richer man for me and wont let me give you half i want to now when i have the right amy looked up at him and was satisfied. her little jealous fear vanished forever and she thanked him with a face full of love and confidence. theres one sort of poverty that i particularly like to help. and demis brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the new thought. mr. bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study astonished by the spectacle that met his eye. excuse me for a moment. then if she was going to megs he always had something for the babies. for the drops continued to fall and being a woman as well as a lover she felt that though it was too late to save her heart she might her bonnet. jo im ashamed of you on learning his good fortune she almost clapped her hands. was the joy all for the boys will you come in he asked stopping before a window full of fruit and flowers. and jos heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he would hear it. she asked turning her back to him and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face. he asked as if the words were very pleasant to him. mr. bhaer was going away he only cared for her as a friend it was all a mistake and the sooner it was over the better. i didnt see the name distinctly. never mind i can walk. mr. bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks though she turned her head away. i came to see if you could care for it and i waited to be sure that i was something more than a friend. am i he added all in one breath. said jo and he was quite satisfied for she folded both hands over his arm and looked up at him with an expression that plainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him even though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella if he carried it. it is more sweet to me than i can tell. yes. that i do not believe. she asked wondering what he meant. read and find him. no toys in this first chest remain     for all are carried away     in their old age to join again     in another small megs play. ah happy mother my beth the dust is always swept     from the lid that bears your name     as if by loving eyes that wept     by careful hands that often came. ive known it long enough to lose my dread and be happy working for those i love and dont call yourself old forty is the prime of life. the professor found that so touching that he would have been glad of his handkerchief if he could have got at it. i must go away and do my work alone. i have my duty also and my work. i couldnt enjoy myself if i neglected them even for you so theres no need of hurry or impatience. jo led her lover in and shut the door. its a splendid idea. bless his dear heart hes been doing it all his life helping poor boys i mean not getting rich that hell never be. money doesnt stay in his pocket long enough to lay up any. its just the place for boys the house is big and the furniture strong and plain. such work is healthy isnt it sir of course i shall have rich pupils also perhaps begin with such altogether. rich peoples children often need care and comfort as well as poor. ive been through something of it and i know all about it. i am proud of you teddy for you get better every year and everyone feels it though you wont let them say so. you have rather cast me off lately jo but ive had the best of help nevertheless. in this way the sly old gentleman got round proud jo and furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted. every room in the big house was soon full. every little plot in the garden soon had its owner. everybody was there. everybody laughed and sang climbed up and tumbled down. asked amy smiling as she watched laurie and john playing cricket with the boys. i asked for splendid things to be sure but in my heart i knew i should be satisfied if i had a little home and john and some dear children like these. ive begun to model a figure of baby and laurie says it is the best thing ive ever done. this cross was doing much for both father and mother for one love and sorrow bound them closely together. laurie was growing more serious strong and firm and both were learning that beauty youth good fortune even love itself cannot keep care and pain loss and sorrow from the most blessed for ...
    into each life some rain must fall     some days must be dark and sad and dreary. im growing as thin as a shadow and am thirty. just so stories 

in the sea once upon a time o my best beloved there was a whale and he ate fishes. all the fishes he could find in all the sea he ate with his mouth so not so but far otherwise. so did the whale. he was afraid that the whale might be angry with him. come out of the desert and go to the three and behave. all the same he had no manners then and he has no manners now and he never will have any manners. and there was a great deal more in that than you would think. because five weeks later there was a heat wave in the red sea and everybody took off all the clothes they had. then he danced three times round the skin and rubbed his hands. he would indeed they didnt indeed he knew. he knew. i suppose it is because we have just come in out of the sunshine. its a long time since weve hunted em. so he said be quiet o you person without any form. sit on its head till the morning same as me. but i couldnt all yesterday. this is the way its done. one two three thats a trick worth learning. i went into other spots as fast as i could. theres plenty of black left on my skin still. that is all. but they will never do it again best beloved. they are quite contented as they are. heres your boots ive brought em and heres your cap and stick    and heres your pipe and tobacco. oh come along out of it quick. come hither little one said the crocodile. i think said the crocodile and he said it between his teeth like this i think today i will begin with elephants child
at this o best beloved the elephants child was much annoyed and he said speaking through his nose like this led go for o best beloved you will see and understand that the crocodile had pulled it out into a really truly trunk same as all elephants have today. i should like it very much indeed said the elephants child. when he wanted fruit to eat he pulled fruit down from a tree instead of waiting for it to fall as he used to do. when he wanted grass he plucked grass up from the ground instead of going on his knees as he used to do. it does said the elephants child. i send them over land and sea        i send them east and west      but after they have worked for me        i give them all a rest. i let them rest from nine till five. he wants to be popular and very truly run after. this o beloved of mine ends the first part of the tale he had to he had to he had to he had to first he hopped one yard then he hopped three yards then he hopped five yards his legs growing stronger his legs growing longer. he had to he had to i wish that i hadnt. my but they covered the ground and so that was all right best beloved. do you see do you see now which of you is hedgehog and which is tortoise are you quite sure are you quite sure now i know youre tortoise. you thought i wouldnt as soon as he could speak he said now i know he isnt tortoise at all. your mother was quite right. if youll think again youll find that i didnt say anything of the kind. my mother told me that i was to drop one of you two into the water and as you seem so anxious to be dropped i think you dont want to be dropped. you should have dropped him into the water. im going to try to learn to swim. its making you black in the face. a little more practice will make you a regular whale. two holes i think you said then they saw that they were both of them quite different from what they had been. he was so astonished that he fell three times backward over his own painted tail without stopping. i know it was. then he went to fetch his mother. everything has its proper name. so that all right best beloved. do you see heres a pretty kettle of fish said tegumai. taffy sat down too with her toes in the water and her chin in her hand and thought very hard. come here said taffy. she must be the daughter of that noble chief who is so great that he wont take any notice of me. so he smiled more politely than ever. she waves her arms and she shouts at me but i dont understand a word of what she says. oh said she. now i see of course i cant write but i can draw pictures if ive anything sharp to scratch with. first ill draw daddy fishing. it looks as if it was sticking in daddys back but thats because the sharks tooth slipped and this piece of bark isnt big enough. my hair doesnt stand up like ive drawn but its easier to draw that way. now ill draw you. he is a great chief or he would have noticed me. mind you dont fall in it isnt as high as the hills really but i cant draw things very small. she is beautiful. shell be pleased of me because i can draw. now in case you forget ive drawn the spear that daddy wants outside our cave. ive made her holding up her hands because i know shell be so pleased to see you. isnt it a beautiful picture now i see why the great chief pretended not to notice me he feared that his enemies were hiding in the bushes and would see him. therefore he turned to me his back and let the wise and wonderful child draw the terrible picture showing me his difficulties. now this is the picture that taffy had drawn for him what have you been doing taffy said tegumai. he had mended his spear and was carefully waving it to and fro. if you wont ask me questions youll know all about it in a little time and youll be surprised. you dont know how surprised youll be daddy well you have been quick said taffy. but why did you bring so many people daddy dear this is my surprise. are you surprised daddy
very said tegumai but it has ruined all my fishing for the day. explain explain explain cried all the tribe of tegumai. you said the tribe of tegumai all together. you
taffy dear im afraid were in for a little trouble said her daddy and put his arm round her so she didnt care. explain explain explain said the head chief of the tribe of tegumai and he hopped on one foot. there was only one spear. he is a very nice man. why have you filled his hair with mud never mind. at present it is only pictures and as we have seen today pictures are not always properly understood. but from that day to this and i suppose it is all taffys fault very few little girls have ever liked learning to read or write. will that do to begin with
yes said taffy. ah ah said her daddy. do say ah daddy and keep your mouth open at the end and lend me that tooth. 1. now ill copy it. said taffy. will you understand this when you see it
perfectly said her daddy. and she drew this. hm said taffy. no. if theyre joined ill forget. draw it separate. draw his tail. if hes standing on his head the tail will come first. a good notion said tegumai. ill try now said taffy. member i cant draw like you daddy. thats beautiful she said. thats quite easy said taffy. you make your mouth all around like an egg or a stone. so an egg or a stone will do for that.
you cant always find eggs or stones. well have to scratch a round something like one. and he drew this. eh what said her daddy. its the noise a snake makes daddy when it is thinking and doesnt want to be disturbed. will this do and she drew this. there she said. and theres more in this game than you think. ill show said her daddy. two noises mixed yo bad water said taffy. not yet said tegumai not till weve gone a little further. lets see. yo is bad water but so is food cooked on the fire isnt it and he drew this. yes. snake and egg said taffy so that means dinners ready. if you saw that scratched on a tree youd know it was time to come to the cave. thats true too. but wait a minute. i see a difficulty. no look and she drew this. do some more noises. then she stopped. if we drew that in a hurry we might mistake it for the round egg itself. i tell you what well do. oh thats lovely much better than a thin frog. go on said taffy using her sharks tooth. he went on till he had drawn this. dont look up taffy he said. try if you can make out what that means in the tegumai language. was that what you meant to tell me
of course said her daddy. ill always remember now. more than that more than that he said. river come to. what a lot of new sounds i dont see how we can draw them.
but i do but i do said tegumai. just attend a minute taffy and we wont do any more today. la then id have drawn your spear all broken this way and she drew. the very thing said tegumai. thats la all over. oh weve done that before. and he drew. now weve got it said tegumai standing on one leg. thats enough for today said tegumai. besides youre getting tired taffy. never mind dear. you can see from these three pictures partly how it happened. for far oh very far behind        so far she cannot call to him      comes tegumai alone to find        the daughter that was all to him. first he got the earth ready then he got the sea ready and then he told all the animals that they could come out and play. and the animals said o eldest magician what shall we play at and he said i will show you. one by one he took all the beasts and birds and fishes and told them what to play at. and the play went on till there were no more animals left without orders and the eldest magician wiped the fine dust off his hands and walked about the world to see how the animals were playing. is that the play you told it to play
no said the eldest magician. this is wrong. then the eldest magician stood up and shouted ho beasts birds and fishes that i took between my hands at the very beginning and taught the play that you should play which one of you is playing with the sea
then all the beasts birds and fishes said together eldest magician we play the plays that you taught us to play we and our childrens children. and the eldest magician said how wise are little children who see and are silent ah said the eldest magician. once a day and once a night i return. not a common crab but a king crab. indeed you are very important said the eldest magician. look there is that man who talked to you at the very beginning. if he had not taken up your attention i should not have grown tired of waiting and run away and all this would never have happened. look there is that girl who saw me running away at the very beginning. if she had spoken then the eldest magician would have called me back and all this would never have happened. i can dig holes. i can climb trees. i did not know i was so important. was that well done said the eldest magician. yes said the man. so your children shall be lazy. if i am to be lazy all my days let the sea work for me twice a day for ever. now listen and attend oh yes must go round another way. would have a fit      if it found itself on it. he walked by himself and all places were alike to him. of course the man was wild too. he was dreadfully wild. he didnt even begin to be tame till he met the woman and she told him that she did not like living in his wild ways. she made the first singing magic in the world. out in the wet wild woods all the wild animals gathered together where they could see the light of the fire a long way off and they wondered what it meant. i am the cat who walks by himself and all places are alike to me. but when he had gone a little way the cat said to himself all places are alike to me. but he never told anybody. she made the second singing magic in the world. out in the wild woods all the wild animals wondered what had happened to wild dog and at last wild horse stamped with his foot and said i will go and see and say why wild dog has not returned. i am the cat who walks by himself and all places are alike to me. but he never told anybody. when the man and the dog came back from hunting the man said what is wild horse doing here and the woman said his name is not wild horse any more but the first servant because he will carry us from place to place for always and always and always. ride on his back when you go hunting. next day holding her wild head high that her wild horns should not catch in the wild trees wild cow came up to the cave and the cat followed and hid himself just the same as before and everything happened just the same as before and the cat said the same things as before and when wild cow had promised to give her milk to the woman every day in exchange for the wonderful grass the cat went back through the wet wild woods waving his wild tail and walking by his wild lone just the same as before. but he never told anybody. she will give us the warm white milk for always and always and always and i will take care of her while you and the first friend and the first servant go hunting. cat said i am not a friend and i am not a servant. your are neither a friend nor a servant. you have said it yourself. must i never sit by the warm fire must i never drink the warm white milk you are very wise and very beautiful. so i will make a bargain with you. that night when the man and the horse and the dog came home from hunting the woman did not tell them of the bargain that she had made with the cat because she was afraid that they might not like it. cat went far and far away and hid himself in the wet wild woods by his wild lone for a long time till the woman forgot all about him. one evening bat said there is a baby in the cave. he is fond of warm things to hold in his arms when he goes to sleep. he is fond of being played with. the woman was busy cooking that morning and the baby cried and interrupted. but still the baby cried. and the baby laughed and the woman heard him and smiled. because it remembered the bargain she had made with the cat and when the woman went to pick it up lo and behold o my enemy and wife of my enemy and mother of my enemy said the cat it is i for you have spoken a word in my praise and now i can sit within the cave for always and always and always. but the baby cried because the cat had gone away and the woman could not hush it for it struggled and kicked and grew black in the face. now said the cat i will sing the baby a song that shall keep him asleep for an hour. the woman smiled as she looked down upon the two of them and said that was wonderfully done. because it remembered the bargain she had made with the cat and when it had cleared away lo and behold o my enemy and wife of my enemy and mother of my enemy said the cat it is i for you have spoken a second word in my praise and now i can sit by the warm fire at the back of the cave for always and always and always. even the first friend is not quick enough to catch little mice as you have done. o my enemy and wife of my enemy and mother of my enemy said the cat it is i for you have spoken three words in my praise and now i can drink the warm white milk three times a day for always and always and always. if i have my place in the cave by the fire and my warm white milk three times a day i do not care what the man or the dog can do.
that evening when the man and the dog came into the cave the woman told them all the story of the bargain while the cat sat by the fire and smiled. if you had not said that last i would have put all these things away for always and always and always but i am now going to throw my two boots and my little stone axe that makes three at you whenever i meet you. and so shall all proper men do after me
then the dog said wait a minute. he has not made a bargain with me or with all proper dogs after me. and he showed his teeth and said if you are not kind to the baby while i am in the cave for always and always and always i will hunt you till i catch you and when i catch you i will bite you. but still i am the cat that walks by himself and all places are alike to me.
not when i am near said the dog. if you had not said that last i would have shut my mouth for always and always and always but now i am going to hunt you up a tree whenever i meet you. and so shall all proper dogs do after me.
then the man threw his two boots and his little stone axe that makes three at the cat and the cat ran out of the cave and the dog chased him up a tree and from that day to this best beloved three proper men out of five will always throw things at a cat whenever they meet him and all proper dogs will chase him up a tree. but the cat keeps his side of the bargain too. he will kill mice and he will be kind to babies when he is in the house just as long as they do not pull his tail too hard. but when he has done that and between times and when the moon gets up and night comes he is the cat that walks by himself and all places are alike to him. it is the story of the butterfly that stamped. now attend all over again and listen upon the third finger of the right hand he wore a ring. he very seldom showed off and when he did he was sorry for it. i am the smallest of thirty thousand brothers and our home is at the bottom of the sea. i gave that dinner to show what a great and rich king i was and not because i really wanted to be kind to the animals. after that he never forgot that it was silly to show off and now the real story part of my story begins. she loved him too much. she sat in her rooms in the golden palace or walked in the palace garden and was truly sorry for him. she is my wife and you know what wives are like. of course he did. i meant him to hear me.
and what did he say they never mean half they say. ask him to stamp and see what will happen. remember said the butterfly. i should very much like to see it done. i dare you to do it she said. stamp stamp he forgot all about his queens he forgot all about the animal that came out of the sea he forgot about showing off. you know i cant do it and now shell never believe a word i say. i dare you to do it stamp stamp now the butterflys wife fluttered about in the dark crying oh ill be good im so sorry i spoke. no go in peace little folk and he kissed them on the wings and they flew away. there was never a king like solomon        not since the world began      but solomon talked to a butterfly        as a man would talk to a man. how then is this are the green fields gone what do they here but look strange no. they must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. once more. say you are in the country in some high land of lakes. there is magic in it. but here is an artist. surely all this is not without meaning. and at first this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. tell me that. on the contrary passengers themselves must pay. and there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid. ah much was i disappointed upon learning that the little packet for nantucket had already sailed and that no way of reaching that place would offer till the following monday. i knew no one in the place. so on i went. such dreary streets at this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter of the town proved all but deserted. ha yes these eyes are windows and this body of mine is the house. can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights go down to the fiery pit itself in order to keep out this frost that once found out and all the rest were plain. but stop does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish even the great leviathan himself all right take a seat. they had just landed from their boat and this was the first house they entered. in fact you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother. i dont know how it is but people like to be private when they are sleeping. i now took the measure of the bench and found that it was a foot too short but that could be mended with a chair. thinks i ill wait awhile he must be dropping in before long. you and i must understand one another and that too without delay. i come to your house and want a bed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer. i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is and whether i shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him. but what is this on the chest i took it up and held it close to the light and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. i went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall and i never saw such a sight in my life. i then took off my coat and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves. but i lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a word till spoken to. what a sight such a face and what is it thought i after all its only his outside a man can be honest in any sort of skin. now while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning this harpooneer never noticed me at all. but the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all he never moved his lips. watch coffin angels but thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand and leaping from the bed i ran up to him. i stood looking at him a moment. but i dont fancy having a man smoking in bed with me. its dangerous. upon waking next morning about daylight i found queequegs arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. you had almost thought i had been his wife. let me try to explain them. the circumstance was this. i felt dreadfully. sixteen hours in bed for what seemed ages piled on ages i lay there frozen with the most awful fears not daring to drag away my hand yet ever thinking that if i could but stir it one single inch the horrid spell would be broken. nevertheless a man like queequeg you dont see every day he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding. his education was not yet completed. however a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce a good thing the mores the pity. so if any one man in his own proper person afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let him not be backward but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way. you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. but who could show a cheek like queequeg still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had anywhere. it makes a stranger stare. many are as green as the green mountains whence they came. in some things you would think them but a few hours old. look there not at all. the town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in in all new england. whence came they i am sure that i did not. oh but somehow i grew merry again. but what then in fact take my body who will take it i say it is not me. thats the opinion of learned men. miserable man oh he will not confess himself suspected but that itself is strong suspicion. but he swiftly calls away the captain from that scent. oh a dreadful storm comes on the ship is like to break. thy country what people he feels that his dreadful punishment is just. that was it woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness with much interest i sat watching him. you cannot hide the soul. i drew my bench near him and made some friendly signs and hints doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. i let them stay. but what is worship impossible now queequeg is my fellow man. and what do i wish that this queequeg would do to me it is not down in any map true places never are. but alas hence the queer ways about him though now some time from home. i looked at the grand and glorious fellow but saw no one to be saved. the boat soon picked them up. nantucket take out your map and look at it. they resolved to follow in the same direction. oh sweet friends a noble craft but somehow a most melancholy all noble things are touched with that. but let us understand each other. now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whales throat and then jump after it was not that what ye said i thought so. do ye wish to go round cape horn to see any more of it eh but i said nothing only looking round me sharply. peleg now threw open a chest and drawing forth the ships articles placed pen and ink before him and seated himself at a little table. fiery pit ye insult me man past all natural bearing ye insult me. thats he thank ye bildad. i dont know exactly whats the matter with him but he keeps close inside the house a sort of sick and yet he dont look so. any how young man he wont always see me so i dont suppose he will thee. his lance oh never say it anywhere. captain ahab did not name himself. and perhaps other fools like her may tell thee the same. i wish to warn thee. its a lie. think of that by that sweet girl that old man has a child hold ye then there can be any utter hopeless harm in ahab and somehow at the time i felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for i dont know what unless it was the cruel loss of his leg. however my thoughts were at length carried in other directions so that for the present dark ahab slipped my mind. queequeg thought he knew what he was about i suppose he seemed to be content and there let him rest. i tried to open it but it was fastened inside. why dont you speak i began to grow alarmed. thats strange thought i but at any rate since the harpoon stands yonder and he seldom or never goes abroad without it therefore he must be inside here and no possible mistake. something must have happened. i went to make the bed after breakfast and the door was locked and not a mouse to be heard and its been just so silent ever since. la murder has the poor lad a sister kill whats that noise there he looked neither one way nor the other way but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life. i went down to supper. but no there he was just where i had left him he had not stirred an inch. now as i before hinted i have no objection to any persons religion be it what it may so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person because that other person dont believe it also. and just so i now did with queequeg. it was after a great feast given by his father the king on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two oclock in the afternoon and all cooked and eaten that very evening. after all i do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon queequeg. what church dost thee mean come aboard come aboard never mind about the papers. by the great anchor what a harpoon hes got there you see him goodness gracious think of that when every moment we thought the ship would sink death and the judgment then what think of death and the judgment then no no time to think about death then. but you must jump when he gives an order. didnt ye hear a word about them matters and something more eh no i dont think ye did how could ye who knows it not all nantucket i guess. names down on the papers anyhow its all fixed and arranged aready and some sailors or other must go with him i suppose as well these as any other men god pity em oh somehow the sight of him struck me so that i said nothing to queequeg of his being behind but passed on with my comrade anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did. but it seems they always give very long notice in these cases and the ship did not sail for several days. and though this also holds true of merchant vessels yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen. nor was bildad himself nor captain peleg at all backward. as for bildad he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed and at every fresh arrival down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper. and much this way it was with me. i said nothing and tried to think nothing. at last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail. so next morning queequeg and i took a very early start. goodbye to ye. get off queequeg i sat at the feet. she sails today. well call all hands then. and as for captain ahab no sign of him was yet to be seen only they said he was in the cabin. but there was not much chance to think over the matter for captain peleg was now all alive. that was my first kick. thinks i captain peleg must have been drinking something today. at last the anchor was up the sails were set and off we glided. stand by to come close alongside now be careful in the hunt ye mates. within the year. dont forget your prayers either. oh goodbye goodbye dont keep that cheese too long down in the hold mr. starbuck itll spoil. is all this agony so vain but this is not the half look again. ah the world oh the world who wrote the first account of our leviathan who but mighty job they have something better than royal blood there. good again but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable. whaling not respectable no dignity in whaling no more no more what doom was his own fathers the great god absolute stubb was the second mate. what he thought of death itself there is no telling. for like his nose his short black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face. but queequeg is already known. tashtego was stubb the second mates squire. he went before. ah stubb thou didst not know ahab then. but go thy ways i had forgot. yes that was the thought coming up in me but it would be the first time i ever did pray. is he mad a hot old man well well i dont know what it is but the lord keep me from catching it. and now that i think of it thats about the first thing babies do and thats a sort of queer too. but hows that didnt he call me a dog he might as well have kicked me and done with it. what the devils the matter with me i dont stand right on my legs. how oh my pipe hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone what business have i with this pipe you know the old mans ivory leg well i dreamed he kicked me with it and when i tried to kick back upon my soul my little man i kicked my leg right off why thinks i whats the row slid man but i was frightened. but somehow next moment i was over the fright. what am i about says i at last. well then says he wise stubb what have you to complain of didnt he kick with right good will it wasnt a common pitch pine leg he kicked with was it no you were kicked by a great man and with a beautiful ivory leg stubb. its an honor i consider it an honor. listen wise stubb. but its made a wise man of me flask. dye see ahab standing there sideways looking over the stern well the best thing you can do flask is to let the old man alone never speak to him whatever he says. whats that he shouts look sharp all of ye stand by for it flask. yet is it no easy task. he is not even by any means the largest of the whales. behold the hope of him is vain there you have him. the sperm whale ii. the right whale iii. book i. book i. book i. how then and it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned. what then remains to proceed. book i. at any rate the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one. his oil is not very valuable. book i. i have seen him at a distance off cape horn. let him go. i know little more of him nor does anybody else. book i. thus ends book i. book ii. book ii. book ii. his oil is very superior clear and fine but there is little of it and he is seldom hunted. book ii. i never heard what sort of oil he has. book ii. thus ends book ii. ii. iii. book iii. they are the lads that always live before the wind. book iii. very savage. he is only found i think in the pacific. i have lowered for him many times but never yet saw him captured. book iii. you cannot but plainly see that i have kept my word. oh ahab a problem perhaps not. in his own proper turn each officer waited to be served. with one mind their intent eyes all fastened upon the old mans knife as he carved the chief dish before him. no and poor little flask he was the youngest son and little boy of this weary family party. another thing. flask was the last person down at the dinner and flask is the first man up. consider peace and satisfaction thought flask have for ever departed from my stomach. i am an officer but how i wish i could fish a bit of oldfashioned beef in the forecastle as i used to when i was before the mast. now ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the pequods cabin. alas so that in real truth the mates and harpooneers of the pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it. enter ahab then all. it drew near the close of day. but this did not last long. look ye dye see it death and devils but whats this long face about mr. starbuck wilt thou not chase the white whale madness but tis enough. but not my master man is even that fair play. whos over me take off thine eye let it go. look the crew man the crew are they not one and all with ahab in this matter of the whale see stubb and what is it reckon it. what is it more ah thy silence then that voices thee. why stay ye not when ye come round with it round that way it went this way it comes. boy come back hand it me. well done i do not order ye ye will it. ha starbuck but the deed is done drink ye harpooneers the cabin by the stern windows ahab sitting alone and gazing out. is then the crown too heavy that i wear dry heat upon my brow oh no more. oh hard i lost this leg. thats more than ye ye great gods ever were. no yeve knocked me down and i am up again but ye have run and hidden. come forth from behind your cotton bags i have no long gun to reach ye. man has ye there. horrible old man oh yet is there hope. time and tide flow wide. i would up heart were it not like lead. oh god hark peace oh life but tis not me that horrors out of me ha ha ha ha why so i heard not all his talk with starbuck but to my poor eye starbuck then looked something as i the other evening felt. i know not all that may be coming but be it what it will ill go to it laughing. i feel funny. mr. starbuck harpooneers and sailors. may your  hearts never fail eight bells there forward eight bells there strike the bell eight thou pip and let me call the watch. eight bells there below dutch sailor. at em again french sailor. what say ye there comes the other watch. stand by all legs pip little pip pip. dont know where it is. french sailor. throw yourselves legs legs im sorry to throw cold water on the subject but excuse me. me too wheres your girls who but a fool would take his left hand by his right and say to himself how dye do ah here comes the music now for it now boys dancing go it pip pip. china sailor. french sailor. tear yourselves tashtego. quietly smoking. dance on lads youre young i was once. tell me not of it lip heart ah the blast crack crack old ship well done he has his orders mind ye that. english sailor. blood we are the lads to hunt him up his whale all. aye aye steady. what of that whos afraid of blacks afraid of me spanish sailor. aside. no offence. none. yes. spanish sailor. spanish sailor meeting him. knife thee heartily big frame small spirit all. a row a row a row a row english sailor. fair play a ring a ring ready formed. there sweet work right work no why then god madst thou the ring all. god duck lower pip here comes the royal yard hold on hard that captain was ahab. question that proud sad king a family likeness i cannot tell can only hint the things that darted through me then. but at last i awoke and turning asked a sailor what bird was this. never why should this be so let us try. wonder ye then at the fiery hunt but not so in the reality perhaps. so too with some other feeding grounds where he had at times revealed himself. yes. ah god i say three years but i am pretty sure it was more than that. but this is not all. yet i tell you that upon one particular voyage which i made to the pacific among many others we spoke thirty different ships every one of which had had a death by a whale some of them more than one and three that had each lost a boats crew. very good but there is more coming. i tell you the sperm whale will stand no nonsense. i have the honor of being a nephew of his. and indeed the shock was so sudden and violent that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock but when the amazement was a little over we cast the lead and sounded but found no ground. nor is there any reason it should be. but as he destroyed ships as well as for other reasons he must have been a whale and i am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale. and i will tell you why. his body was reaching eagerly forward his hand stretched out like a wand and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries. there there there she blows the ship was now kept away from the wind and she went gently rolling before it. didnt i hear em in the hold what is it you stare at hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil my heroes bite something you dogs long and strong. give way there give way pull will ye pull cant ye pull wont ye pull and start your eyes out starbuck strong strong boys but never mind mr. stubb all for the best. let all your crew pull strong come what will. spring my men spring pull my boys sperm sperms the play they were hidden down there. the white whales at the bottom of it. well well so be it cant be helped all right give way men boat and crew sat motionless on the sea. instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way. it is used for catching turns with the whale line. all four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air. he did not say much to his crew though nor did his crew say anything to him. o lord lord see fits but what the devil are you hurrying about softly softly and steadily my men. only pull and keep pulling nothing more. meanwhile all the boats tore on. a short rushing sound leaped out of the boat it was the darted iron of queequeg. the mist still spread over the sea the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat. again we swam for it were dashed against it by the seas and were at last taken up and safely landed on board. ha ha after the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion i felt all the easier a stone was rolled away from my heart. oh on life and death this old man walked. every sailor swore he saw it once but not a second time. cape of good hope do they call ye terrible old man only her lower sails were set. this is the pequod bound round the world tell them to address all future letters to the pacific ocean because in the case of pirates say i should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it. as told at the golden inn. theyre playing the devil with his estate i can tell him. i mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men. pardon cried another of the company. oh your cup no need to travel do you want to sink the ship by knocking off at a time like this turn to and he once more raised a pistol. aye let her sink. what say ye men turning to his comrades. only three were left. for himself he would do this he said whether they joined him or not. that was the last night he should spend in that den. and what was more they each insisted upon being the first man on deck when the time to make the rush should come. it was moby dick. he was always a furious man it seems in a boat. he cut it and the whale was free. the captain presented a pistol. now repeat after me. it is so passing wonderful i go for it but are you well advised now venerable priest further into the light and hold the holy book before me that i may touch it. what shall be said of these ah my gallant captain why did ye not give us jonah looking out of that eye they are generally richard iii. consider not at all. for it is one of the more curious things about this leviathan that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. so there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like. but i pass that matter by. that is not his fault though. the action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true. indeed in other respects you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore. god keep thee push not off from that isle thou canst never return then once more arose and silently gleamed. it seemed not a whale and yet is this moby dick there again right ahead the four boats were soon on the water ahabs in advance and all swiftly pulling towards their prey. in the same spot where it sank once more it slowly rose. at first sight you would not think it so strong as it really is. this arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. but why say more and lo but that pipe poor whale was thy last. yes a mighty change had come over the fish.  more turns were taken so that the line began holding its place. your hat however is the most convenient. his heart had burst out of the trunk the branches grow out of them the twigs. nor in general is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse. stubbs whale had been killed some distance from the ship. blast me if i can hear my own voice. away cook and deliver my message. you hear thats queer too. i mean when you die cook. its an awful question. how but none of us are in heaven yet. do ye hear what aloft dye hear stop many a good supper have i thus made. but no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer perhaps he was hung and if he had been put on his trial by oxen he certainly would have been and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. but stubb he eats the whale by its own light does he and that is adding insult to injury is it nor was this all. you would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods. the question is what and where is the skin of the whale at any rate it is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles as you may say. but what i am driving at here is this. but no more of this. nor is this all. oh man admire and model thyself after the whale do thou too remain warm among ice. do thou too live in this world without being of it. but how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things of creatures how few vast as the whale nor is this the end. when this last task was accomplished it was noon and the seamen went below to their dinner. o head o nature and o soul of man hand in hand ship and breeze blew on but the breeze came faster than the ship and soon the pequod began to rock. moreover they were afraid of him. but it is time to return to the pequod. soon starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. poor fellow it fell at ahabs feet. now hands are wanted here and then again hands are wanted there. there is no staying in any one place for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere. are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world but courage there is good cheer in store for you queequeg. no hands him ye gods take that i hope i do no wrong mr.
starbuck. the first contained strong spirits and was handed to queequeg the second was aunt charitys gift and that was freely given to the waves. but we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it. nor was this long wanting. but it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain. but i sometimes think hell charm the ship to no good at last. i dont half like that chap stubb. hes the devil i say. blast him well he was at home and asked the devil what he wanted. did ye read it there flask doesnt the devil live for ever who ever heard that the devil was dead did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil youll know it before long flask. oh ye foolish but nothing like this in the present case had been done. here now are two great whales laying their heads together let us join them and lay together our own. there is more character in the sperm whales head. but i must be content with a hint. how is it then with the whale but the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. with respect to their ears this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right. is it not curious that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hares but let us hold on here by this tooth and look about us where we are. crossing the deck let us now have a good long look at the right whales head. look at that hanging lower lip good lord is this the road that jonah went at any rate if we yield to it we must grant a far greater age to the right whale than at first glance will seem reasonable. can you catch the expression of the sperm whales there but mark the other heads expression. now mark. the next a loud splash announced that my brave queequeg had dived to the rescue. some hands now jumped into a boat alongside and pushed a little off from the ship. now how had this noble rescue been accomplished as for the great head itself that was doing as well as could be expected. we have thee there. he has no proper nose. in thought a fine human brow is like the east when troubled with the morning. in the repose of the pasture the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it. but how genius in the sperm whale has the sperm whale ever written a book spoken a speech no his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it. i but put that brow before you. read it if you can. oh are ye going to let that rascal beat ye this wont do boys. oh dont ye love sperm hurrah this is the way to sail now. hurrah hurrah suspended and to what to three bits of board. this he oh his eyes or rather the places where his eyes had been were beheld. but pity there was none. it was his death stroke. who had darted that stone lance and when it might have been darted by some nor west indian long before america was discovered. the ship groaned and gasped. by thunder men we must do something or go for it. but it is not so. where one of that sort go down twenty right whales do. but the reason of this is obvious. oh any man may kill a snake but only a perseus a st. george a coffin have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale. but he had still another reason for his want of faith. how is that yes. he might have carried him round by the way of the cape of good hope. and so it was. what then remained that is to say he would then live without breathing. how is this this is what i mean. but what does he want of them but then again what has the whale to say oh but the sperm whales food is far beneath the surface and there he cannot spout even if he would. speak out you have seen him spout then declare what the spout is can you not tell water from air my dear sir in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things. you cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it and bring it away. but still you see his power in his play. but if i know not even the tail of this whale how understand his head thou shalt see my back parts my tail he seems to say but my face shall not be seen. but i cannot completely make out his back parts and hint what he will about his face i say again he has no face. but how now does his crew drink air surely he will stop for water. nay. so ahab. she carries years water in her. for then more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. but sperm whales are not every day encountered while you may then you must kill all you can. and if you cannot kill them all at once you must wing them so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure. our boat was furnished with three of them. but far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. instantly starbuck and queequeg changed places starbuck taking the stern. my god men stand by all fish bed in common. all his comrades quit him. ii. a common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge might possibly object to it. but often possession is the whole of the law. and concerning all these is not possession the whole of the law what india to england but not so. the law itself has already been set forth. but why should the king have the head and the queen the tail but is the queen a mermaid to be presented with a tail and thus there seems a reason in all things even in law. a peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea. poor devil i say pass round a hat some one and lets make him a present of a little oil for dear charitys sake. i wonder now if our old man has thought of that. its worth trying. its a wax nose i have to hold it on. yes thats the word why dont you pack those whales in ice while youre working at em there a queer scene presented itself. but they worked rather slow and talked very fast and seemed in anything but a good humor. yet so it is. they hint that all whales always smell bad. now in the whale ship it is not every one that goes in the boats. poor pip but let us to the story. tashtego stood in the bows. he was full of the fire of the hunt. all passed in a flash. in less than half a minute this entire thing happened. but we are all in the hands of the gods and pip jumped again. it was under very similar circumstances to the first performance but this time he did not breast out the line and hence when the whale started to run pip was left behind on the sea like a hurried travellers trunk. alas stubb was but too true to his word. who can tell it but had stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate no he did not mean to at least. not drowned entirely though. for the rest blame not stubb too hardly. squeeze squeeze squeeze spite of reason it is hard to keep yourself from eating it. 
bible leaves bible leaves these mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron. and here let us go back for a moment. to every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces. my god what is the matter with me thought i. lo look not too long in the face of the fire o man with books the same. there is a wisdom that is woe but there is a woe that is madness. never more to rise and blow. oh yet this is life. oh oh sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night wondering whose it was to be at last and whether he would ever live to spend it. from storm to storm so be it then. so be it then heres stout stuff for woe to work on. he goes below let me read. let me read it once. heres signs and wonders truly heres the book. lets see now. signs and wonders and the sun hes always among em. well the sun he wheels among em. book you lie there the fact is you books must know your places. youll do to give us the bare words and facts but we come in to supply the thoughts. signs and wonders eh oh jollys the word for aye there hes before it hell out with something presently. so whats all this staring been about hark now in what sign will the sun then be ship old ship all sorts of men in one kind of world you see. but aside again what does he say with that look of his ho more and more. would he had died or i hes half horrible to me. stand away again and hear him. ha ha old ahab the white whale hell nail ye this is a pine tree. how did it get there oh the gold the precious precious gold cook ho cook and cook us but here a curious difficulty presented itself. we all struck out. oh ye stars oh why dont ye you know youre a precious jolly rascal. in short it grew black i knew what was threatened and off it came. what should i do without this other arm and he knows it too. no more white whales for me ive lowered for him once and that has satisfied me. but he will still be hunted for all that. how long since thou sawst him last in vain the english captain hailed him. with back to the stranger ship and face set like a flint to his own ahab stood upright till alongside of the pequod. but this is not all. a short life to them and a jolly death. i fancied that you could feel them and roll them about in you after they were swallowed. but the forecastle was not very light and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it. i will tell you. of beef. of stock fish. of soft bread. yet they did aim at them and hit them too. surely not. it was a wondrous sight. what palace may it deck ah mortal he laughed. but soon my line was out and following it back i emerged from the opening where i entered. such a statement may prove useful here. no. for that the best way we can consider it is with a crane to pile its bones high up on end. how then with me writing of this leviathan friends hold my arms the common people imagine that by a secret power bestowed by god upon the temple no whale can pass it without immediate death. but the truth of the matter is that on either side of the temple there are rocks that shoot two miles into the sea and wound the whales when they light upon em. and i have heard on whalemens authority that sperm whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture. no. but you must look at this matter in every light. that is all. but in the end it all came out this one matter did at least. thus this carpenter was prepared at all points and alike indifferent and without respect in all. but not precisely so. forward the red flame of the forge is seen where the blacksmith is at work. that is hard which should be soft and that is soft which should be hard. lets try another. ha thats the heel we are in luck here he comes or its somebody else thats certain. ahab advancing. just in time sir. let me measure sir. good. well its not the first time. about it there keep thy finger on it. right. he makes a fierce red flame there aye sir he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work. sir there take the order and away. now whats he speaking about and whos he speaking to i should like to know shall i keep standing here aside. no no no i must have a lantern. ho ho thats it hey here are two sir one will serve my turn. i thought sir that you spoke to carpenter. carpenter clay sir bone is rather dusty sir. truly sir i begin to understand somewhat now. it is man. look put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was so now here is only one distinct leg to the eye yet two to the soul. hold dont speak good lord perhaps an hour sir. oh life i would be free as air and im down in the whole worlds books. by heavens so. well well well and heres his leg and this is his leg hell stand on this. oh but ahab oh hes a hard driver. what a leg this is aye starbuck what cares ahab poor queequeg for whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man never yet was put into words or books. poor fellow where go ye now if ye find him then comfort him for he must be very sad for look lets make a general of him ho wheres his harpoon oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow i say game game game no no shame he answered certainly. oh woe on woe why tell the whole come hither come hither in no paradise myself i am impatient of all misery in others that is not mad. thou shouldst go mad blacksmith say why dost thou not go mad how canst thou endure without being mad answer that is the one sir quick forge me the harpoon. quick but as ahab looked up he slid aside. oh pip sail on. ill soon take that black from your brow. so go thy ways and i will mine. forward there so seemed it with the pequod. look ha in good time the order came. or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living where is moby dick stubb for one cant fight it. but as for me all the start i have to meet it is just across the deck here. oh and i tell you what it is mr.
starbuck theres no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat. the very course he swung to this day noon now mark his boat there where is that stove now jump overboard and sing away if thou must a moment or two passed when starbuck going forward pushed against some one. it was stubb. but war is pain and hate is woe. i would not take it. oh oh there burn the flames but thou art but my fiery father my sweet mother i know not. oh cruel what hast thou done with her leap tis an ill voyage starbuck approaching him. shall i strike that and how long ago is it since you said the very contrary what then ive part changed my flesh since that time why not my mind but hark again and ill answer ye the other thing. first take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here though so i can pass the rope now listen. what are you talking about then why dont ye be sensible flask its easy to be sensible why dont ye then never mind catch the turn there and pass it. and what big generous hands they are to be sure. what a hold they have too there hammer that knot down and weve done. thank ye. stop that thunder plenty too much thunder up here. whats the use of thunder we dont want thunder we want rum give us a glass of rum. a good sign the fair wind loaded i must see. ill cure myself of this. but how fair ha is he muttering in his sleep sleeping aye but still alive and soon

and matters. by heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way. whats that he said but where and all night ive been sailing from him wherever he did sink to. oh my god mary girl i seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. see ha the harpoon dropped from his hand. but i hold thee to the last letter of thy word. away mates to the ship see pull on oars oars i see the ship the ship dash on my men the jaw is this the end of all my bursting prayers oh ahab ahab lo thy work. steady nay nay he turns to meet us look ye sun moon and stars for all that i would yet ring glasses with ye would ye but hand the cup oh oh oh oh why fly ye not o ahab i only wish that we were where they grow. some fell flat upon their faces. what ho tashtego let me hear thy hammer. oh must ye then perish and without me oh lonely death on lonely life ho ho on the second day a sail drew near nearer and picked me up at last. and that was all we could learn of our guest. he was a very silent man by custom. his stories were what frightened people worst of all. in one way indeed he bade fair to ruin us for he kept on staying week after week and at last month after month so that all the money had been long exhausted and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more. if ever he mentioned it the captain blew through his nose so loudly that you might say he roared and stared my poor father out of the room. he never wrote or received a letter and he never spoke with any but the neighbours and with these for the most part only when drunk on rum. the doctor never so much as moved. he sank daily and my mother and i had all the inn upon our hands and were kept busy enough without paying much regard to our unpleasant guest. i told him i did not know his mate bill and this was for a person who stayed in our house whom we called the captain. he has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him particularly in drink has my mate bill. well put it for argument like that your captain has a cut on one cheek and well put it if you like that that cheeks the right one. ah well i told you. but it was no affair of mine i thought and besides it was difficult to know what to do. now if you had sailed along of bill you wouldnt have stood there to be spoke to twice not you. i was very uneasy and alarmed as you may fancy and it rather added to my fears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself. he bade me go and leave the door wide open. that blow was the last of the battle. once out upon the road black dog in spite of his wound showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute. then he passed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into the house. rum at the same instant my mother alarmed by the cries and fighting came running downstairs to help me. between us we raised his head. he was breathing very loud and hard but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible colour. i got the rum to be sure and tried to put it down his throat but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron. it was a happy relief for us when the door opened and doctor livesey came in on his visit to my father. now mrs. hawkins just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him if possible nothing about it. die and go to your own place like the man in the bible. come now make an effort. he was lying very much as we had left him only a little higher and he seemed both weak and excited. and i lived on rum i tell you. that doctors a fool i tell you. i cant do that theyd have the black spot on me by then. but im a saving soul. i never wasted good money of mine nor lost it neither and ill trick em again. im not afraid on em. he paused when he had got into a sitting position on the edge. well then you get on a horse and go to well yes i will ill tell you if they get that. what i should have done had all gone well i do not know. but as things fell out my poor father died quite suddenly that evening which put all other matters on one side. the captain is not what he used to be. the blind man clung close to me holding me in one iron fist and leaning almost more of his weight on me than i could carry. between this and that i was so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that i forgot my terror of the captain and as i opened the parlour door cried out the words he had ordered in a trembling voice. the poor captain raised his eyes and at one look the rum went out of him and left him staring sober. the expression of his face was not so much of terror as of mortal sickness. he made a movement to rise but i do not believe he had enough force left in his body. business is business. hold out your left hand. i ran to him at once calling to my mother. but haste was all in vain. it is a curious thing to understand for i had certainly never liked the man though of late i had begun to pity him but as soon as i saw that he was dead i burst into a flood of tears. it was the second death i had known and the sorrow of the first was still fresh in my heart. no sooner said than done. the more we told of our troubles the more man woman and child they clung to the shelter of their houses. the name of captain flint though it was strange to me was well enough known to some there and carried a great weight of terror. for that matter anyone who was a comrade of the captains was enough to frighten them to death. and the short and the long of the matter was that while we could get several who were willing enough to ride to dr. liveseys which lay in another direction not one would help us to defend the inn. well have that chest open if we die for it. then my mother got a candle in the bar and holding each others hands we advanced into the parlour. he lay as we had left him on his back with his eyes open and one arm stretched out. i went down on my knees at once. at this triumph we were filled with hope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had slept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival. they had never been worn my mother said. it drew nearer and nearer while we sat holding our breath. that was enough and more than enough for both of us. we had not started a moment too soon. i was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive seven or eight of them running hard their feet beating out of time along the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front. the next moment his voice showed me that i was right. at that another fellow probably him who had remained below to search the captains body came to the door of the inn. they must be close by they cant be far you have your hands on it. there wasnt one of you dared face bill and i did it a blind man and im to lose my chance for you but he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash now utterly bewildered right under the nearest of the coming horses. he hailed her. theyve got off clean and theres an end. mr. dance could make nothing of the scene. well then hawkins what in fortune were they after and now i come to think of it i might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. by the time i had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle. the house was all dark to the front. the door was opened almost at once by the maid. no she said he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire. i had never seen the squire so near at hand. his eyebrows were very black and moved readily and this gave him a look of some temper not bad you would say but quick and high. at last mr. dance finished the story. hawkins will you ring that bell what do they care for but money a knife in his back as like as not. right in three weeks time three weeks we are not the only men who know of this paper. we must none of us go alone till we get to sea. the ship is bought and fitted. she lies at      anchor ready for sea. livesey will not like that. it was      the crew that troubled me. well sir i thought i had only found a cook      but it was a crew i had discovered. long john even got rid of two out of the six      or seven i had already engaged. hang the treasure its the glory of the sea      that has turned my head. so now livesey come      post do not lose an hour if you respect me. hawkins may stay one night with his      mother. it was on seeing that boy that i understood for the first time my situation. i had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me not at all of the home that i was leaving and now at sight of this clumsy stranger who was to stay here in my place beside my mother i had my first attack of tears. next moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight. though i had lived by the shore all my life i seemed never to have been near the sea till then. it was a bright enough little place of entertainment. there was a street on each side and an open door on both which made the large low room pretty clear to see in in spite of clouds of tobacco smoke. as i was waiting a man came out of a side room and at a glance i was sure he must be long john. but one look at the man before me was enough. it was close by him and he was out in the street in a moment. but his hurry had attracted my notice and i recognized him at glance. ben run and help harry. perhaps you dont happen to rightly know who you was speaking to perhaps pipe up that were his name for certain. ah he looked a shark he did he should run him down hand over hand by the powers now hawkins you do me justice with the capn. youre a lad you are but youre as smart as paint. i see that when you first come in. but come now stand by to go about. this wont do. for mind you its serious young hawkins and neither you nor mes come out of it with what i should make so bold as to call credit. nor you neither says you not smart none of the pair of us smart. but dash my buttons long john told the story from first to last with a great deal of spirit and the most perfect truth. the captain who was close behind his messenger entered at once and shut the door behind him. but here dr. livesey cut in. no use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling. the captain has said too much or he has said too little and im bound to say that i require an explanation of his words. but now i find that every man before the mast knows more than i do. next you say you dont like the crew. now you have a good place under the cabin why not put them there first point. as for mr. arrow i believe him thoroughly honest some of the men are the same all may be for what i know. but i am responsible for the ships safety and the life of every man jack aboard of her. i see things going as i think not quite right. as it is i have heard you. it was fairly prosperous. the ship proved to be a good ship the crew were capable seamen and the captain thoroughly understood his business. but before we came the length of treasure island two or three things had happened which require to be known. mr. arrow first of all turned out even worse than the captain had feared. he had no command among the men and people did what they pleased with him. time after time he was ordered below in disgrace. in the meantime we could never make out where he got the drink. that was the ships mystery. yet some of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see him so reduced. he had a way of talking to each and doing everybody some particular service. nobody more welcome than yourself my son. sit you down and hear the news. pieces of eight shes sailed with england the great capn england the pirate. the captain on his part never spoke but when he was spoken to and then sharp and short and dry and not a word wasted. this was how it came about. i ran on deck. the watch was all forward looking out for the island. the barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders against it and i was just about to jump up when the man began to speak. i laid by nine hundred safe from england and two thousand after flint. that aint bad for a man before the mast all safe in bank. wheres all englands men now wheres flints where is he now i think if i had been able that i would have killed him through the barrel. meantime he ran on little supposing he was overheard. but thats not the course i lay. time enough too says you. and how did i begin but i have a way with me i have. feared he was and proud. i want to go into that cabin i do. the last moment i can manage and thats when. heres this squire and doctor with a map and such i dont know where it is do i no more do you says you. well then i mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff and help us to get it aboard by the powers. then well see. thats what all you gentlemen split on first and last. but i know the sort you are. but youre never happy till youre drunk. you hear me i seen a thing or two at sea i have. but not you i know you. ah they was a sweet crew they was well what would you think that would have been englands way. but mark you here im an easy man im quite the gentleman says you but this time its serious. so much i saw almost in a dream for i had not yet recovered from my horrid fear of a minute or two before. the hispaniola was laid a couple of points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the island on the east. it were a main place for pirates once and a hand we had on board knowed all their names for it. sharp as must have been his annoyance silver had the strength of mind to hide it. who might have done that i wonder the pirates were too ignorant i reckon. why it makes me young again. its a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes and you may lay to that. ill tell you what i think of this i think it handsome. and this also was given with a will. on the top of that the three gentlemen went below and not long after word was sent forward that jim hawkins was wanted in the cabin. the stern window was open for it was a warm night and you could see the moon shining behind on the ships wake. nobody interrupted me till i was done nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last. if i gave the word to go about they would rise at once. second point we have time before us at least until this treasures found. third point there are faithful hands. its trying on a man i know. but theres no help for it till we know our men. i began to feel pretty desperate at this for i felt altogether helpless and yet by an odd train of circumstances it was indeed through me that safety came. the bottom was clean sand. and it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived the danger. of all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon this obvious anxiety on the part of long john appeared the worst. we held a council in the cabin. you see sir here it is. i get a rough answer do i not lets allow the men an afternoon ashore. if they all go why well fight the ship. if they none of them go well then we hold the cabin and god defend the right. the captain was too bright to be in the way. he whipped out of sight in a moment leaving silver to arrange the party and i fancy it was as well he did so. had he been on deck he could no longer so much as have pretended not to understand the situation. it was as plain as day. the honest hands and i was soon to see it proved that there were such on board must have been very stupid fellows. at last however the party was made up. if six men were left by silver it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship and since only six were left it was equally plain that the cabin party had no present need of my assistance. it occurred to me at once to go ashore. i turned hither and thither among the trees. little did i suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous rattle. nor was i deceived for soon i heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice which as i continued to give ear grew steadily louder and nearer. another voice answered and then the first voice which i now recognized to be silvers once more took up the story and ran on for a long while in a stream only now and again interrupted by the other. by the sound they must have been talking earnestly and almost fiercely but no distinct word came to my hearing. the sun beat full upon them. not you as sure as god sees me id sooner lose my hand. i had found one of the honest hands well here at that same moment came news of another. and as for you john silver long youve been a mate of mine but youre mate of mine no more. kill me too if you can. whether he were injured much or little none could ever tell. like enough to judge from the sound his back was broken on the spot. but he had no time given him to recover. i could not tell of course the meaning of the signal but it instantly awoke my fears. more men would be coming. i might be discovered. indeed could anyone be more entirely lost than i would not my absence itself be an evidence to them of my alarm and therefore of my fatal knowledge it was all over i thought. goodbye to the hispaniola goodbye to the squire the doctor and the captain what it was whether bear or man or monkey i could in no wise tell. yet a man it was i could no longer be in doubt about that. i stood still therefore and cast about for some method of escape and as i was so thinking the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind. at that i once more stopped. wherever a man is says i a man can do for himself. you mightnt happen to have a piece of cheese about you now no im bound ill be good and i see the way to. rich i says. and ill tell you what ill make a man of you jim. i were in flints ship when he buried the treasure he and six along six strong seamen. but there he was you mind and the six all dead dead and buried. how he done it not a man aboard us could make out. thats what he said. twelve days they looked for it and every day they had the worse word for me until one fine morning all hands went aboard. you can stay here and find flints money for yourself they says. but now you look here look at me. do i look like a man before the mast no says you. well theres my boat that i made with my two hands. i keep her under the white rock. if the worst come to the worst we might try that after dark. under the trees with you ah the captain the squire and i were talking matters over in the cabin. it never occurred to us to doubt jim hawkins but we were alarmed for his safety. with the men in the temper they were in it seemed an even chance if we should see the lad again. we ran on deck. what particularly took my fancy was the spring. i was thinking this over when there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of death. it is something to have been an old soldier but more still to have been a doctor. i found them all shaken as was natural. the squire was sitting down as white as a sheet thinking of the harm he had led us to the good soul and one of the six forecastle hands was little better. i had half a mind to change my plan and destroy their boats but i feared that silver and the others might be close at hand and all might very well be lost by trying for too much. they had the advantage of numbers of course but we had the advantage of arms. i know you are a good man at bottom and i dare say not one of the lot of yous as bad as he makes out. all the same we were afraid to breathe. suddenly the captain spoke up again and i thought his voice was a little changed. my ladys maid couldnt miss. the one source of danger was the gun. the report fell in at the same instant of time. this was the first that jim heard the sound of the squires shot not having reached him. so far there was no great harm. but there were all our stores at the bottom and to make things worse only two guns out of five remained in a state for service. the other three had gone down with the boat. it was plain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt. he was stone dead shot through the heart. both the squire and i returned the shot but as we had nothing to aim at it is probable we only wasted powder. the squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand crying like a child. and not long after without another word he passed away. a hail on the land side. squire captain no thats your friends. and him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand and hes to come alone. oh wild horses wouldnt draw it from you no says you. the next moment each of us had taken to his heels in a different direction. but there was a sound in their voices which suggested rum. i had soon told my story and began to look about me. the latter stood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the surface of the sand. then he put his head on one side and looked at me. it doesnt lie in human nature. i was dead tired as you may fancy and when i got to sleep which was not till after a great deal of tossing i slept like a log of wood. dr. livesey take the north side if you please jim the east gray west. this time it was the other man who replied. dont know him. if you wish to talk to me you can come thats all. its your own doing. a sweet pretty place you have of it here. ah theres jim the top of the morning to you jim. doctor heres my service. well now you look here that was a good lay of yours last night. i dont deny it was a good lay. and ill not deny neither but what some of my people was shook maybe all was shook maybe i was shook myself maybe thats why im here for terms. but you mark me capn it wont do twice by thunder maybe you think we were all a sheet in the winds eye. you would just as soon save your lives i reckon and thats yours. it was as good as the play to see them. you do that and well offer you a choice. now youll own thats talking. you cant find the treasure. you cant sail the ship theres not a man among you fit to sail the ship. you cant fight us gray there got away from five of you. he shook the fire out of his pipe. not a man among us moved. laugh by thunder laugh before an hours out yell laugh upon the other side. it was the first time we had ever seen him angry. doctor i thought you had worn the kings coat the captain looked on for a while in silence. then he spoke. hunter take the east side there. an hour passed away. from the east and west only a single shot had been fired. nor had we much time left to us for thought. but of these one was evidently more frightened than hurt for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly disappeared among the trees. i dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight. someone was close behind i knew not whom. and yet in this breath of time the fight was over and the victory was ours. a third as i had seen the doctor had disposed of at a blow. the doctor and gray and i ran full speed for shelter. the house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke and we saw at a glance the price we had paid for victory. five against three leaves us four to nine. but this was of course not known till after by the faithful party. he was sure to recover the doctor said but in the meantime and for weeks to come he must not walk nor move his arm nor so much as speak when he could help it. as for the scheme i had in my head it was not a bad one in itself. but i was only a boy and i had made my mind up. this was my second folly far worse than the first as i left but two sound men to guard the house but like the first it was a help towards saving all of us. it was already late in the afternoon although still warm and sunny. i have never seen the sea quiet round treasure island. apparently they were talking and laughing though at that distance upwards of a mile i could of course hear no word of what was said. i saw i must lose no time if i were to find the boat that evening. night had almost come when i laid my hand on its rough sides. it was a night out of ten thousand for my purpose. all this time i had heard the sound of loud voices from the cabin but to say truth my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughts that i had scarcely given ear. now however when i had nothing else to do i began to pay more heed. instantly i grasped it. why i should have done so i can hardly say. the speed in the meantime had strangely increased. i opened my eyes at once. that notion was soon given over. i have understood since that they were sea lions and entirely harmless. in the meantime i had a better chance as i supposed before me. i was indeed close in. the sight of the trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing but the current had soon carried me past the point and as the next reach of sea opened out i beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts. right in front of me not half a mile away i beheld the hispaniola under sail. i made sure of course that i should be taken but i was so distressed for want of water that i scarce knew whether to be glad or sorry at the thought and long before i had come to a conclusion surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and i could do nothing but stare and wonder. again and again was this repeated. and if so where were the men either they were dead drunk or had deserted her i thought and perhaps if i could get on board i might return the vessel to her captain. i could not choose but suppose she was deserted. for some time she had been doing the worse thing possible for me standing still. each time she fell off her sails partly filled and these brought her in a moment right to the wind again. but now at last i had my chance. i had scarce time to think scarce time to act and save myself. not a soul was to be seen. suddenly the hispaniola came right into the wind. but when i remembered the talk i had overheard from the apple barrel all pity left me. he rolled his eyes round heavily but he was too far gone to express surprise. it was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy. without i gives you a hint you aint that man as fars i can tell. i can see cant i we struck our bargain on the spot. only as we had no power to anchor and dared not beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther time hung on our hands. he wanted me to leave the deck so much was plain but with what purpose i could in no way imagine. this was all that i required to know. while i was thus turning the business over in my mind i had not been idle with my body. youve broken your trust youve lived in sin and lies and blood theres a man you killed lying at your feet this moment and you ask me why well now i tell you i never seen good come o goodness yet. the tides made good enough by now. scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us. and now boy you stand by. were near the bit now and shes too much way on her. at the same instant he threw himself forward and i leapt sideways towards the bows. i had no time to try my other pistol nor indeed much inclination for i was sure it would be useless. then with a pistol in either hand i addressed him. he stopped instantly. at last with a swallow or two he spoke his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity. a fish or two whipped past his body. i was no sooner certain of this than i began to feel sick faint and terrified. the hot blood was running over my back and chest. i was now alone upon the ship the tide had just turned. i began to see a danger to the ship. for the rest the hispaniola must trust to luck like myself. i scrambled forward and looked over. and yet i wondered in my heart that he should show himself so careless. suddenly a kind of brightness fell about me. it would have been a poor end of my adventures to get shot down by my own party in mistake. for the life of me i could not think what it might be. there was not a soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises of the breeze. i stopped with much wonder in my heart and perhaps a little terror also. by this time i had got to the door and stood up. all was dark within so that i could distinguish nothing by the eye. with my arms before me i walked steadily in. pieces of eight pieces of eight pieces of eight silvers green parrot captain flint i had no time left me to recover. dropped in like eh you neednt stand up for mr. hawkins hell excuse you you may lay to that. just you keep clear of the capn. ships gone. well maybe wed been taking a glass and a song to help it round. i wont say no. we looked out and by thunder the old ship was gone were about sick of him. these was his words. let the worst come to the worst its little i care. ive seen too many die since i fell in with you. the laughs on my side ive had the top of this business from the first i no more fear you than i fear a fly. kill me if you please or spare me. it is for you to choose. and he sprang up drawing his knife as if he had been twenty. maybe you thought you was capn here perhaps. by the powers but ill teach you better him that wants shall get it. you know the way youre all gentlemen o fortune by your account. well im ready. not much worth to fight you aint. you wont fight as gentlemen o fortune should then by thunder youll obey and you may lay to it i like that boy now i never seen a better boy than that. theyre going to throw me off. but you mark i stand by you through thick and thin. i didnt mean to no not till you spoke up. but i see you was the right sort. i says to myself you stand by hawkins john and hawkinsll stand by you. youre his last card and by the living thunder john hes yours ill save your life if so be as i can from them. im on squires side now. how you done it i dont know but safe it is. i never much believed in neither of them. now you mark me. i ask no questions nor i wont let others. look here now this aint lucky youve gone and cut this out of a bible. well what is it anyway ah very pretty wrote to be sure like print i swear. your hand o write george youll be capn next i shouldnt wonder. second you let the enemy out o this here trap for nothing. why did they want out third you wouldnt let us go at them upon the march. well who crossed me but who done it by the powers youve neither sense nor memory and i leave it to fancy where your mothers was that let you come to sea. sea gentlemen o fortune ah says one. why thats john silver. i knowed him well says another. no not us he might be our last chance and i shouldnt wonder. kill that boy not me mates and number three ah well theres a deal to say to number three. why the doctor had given it to him was more than i could fancy. they leaped upon it like cats upon a mouse. how why how do i know whos the better man at that but that was never my way. it was around about the size of a crown piece. that was the end of the nights business. he well george how goes it did you take that medicine no i should be surprised if he did the mans tongue is fit to frighten the french. silver im surprised at you. silver struck the barrel with his open hand. and i take it ive found a way asll suit all. it seemed to me so obvious in this case that i could not imagine how he was to turn their anger. youre a good man and a true i never seen a better man and youll not forget what i done good not any more than youll forget the bad i know. and i step aside see here and leave you and jim alone. jump but doctor you did not let me finish. rapidly i described to him my adventures and he heard me out in silence. that would be a poor return my boy. why this is the mischief in person. and yet i done your bidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope but no this heres too much. i seen the doctor waving you to run for it with the tail of my eye i did and i seen you say no as plain as hearing. jim thats one to you. and this the more surprised me for i thought he had never shown himself so cunning as he did then. i got what i wanted i did. sure enough they have the ship. where they have it i dont know yet but once we hit the treasure well have to jump about and find out. he had still a foot in either camp and there was no doubt he would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from hanging which was the best he had to hope on our side. nay and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith with dr. livesey even then what danger lay before us for all the world i was led like a dancing bear. all the stores i observed came from our stock and i could see the truth of silvers words the night before. a tall tree was thus the principal mark. it was indeed a most pleasant portion of the island that we were now approaching. shout after shout came from him and the others began to run in his direction. i believe a chill struck for a moment to every heart. but what sort of a way is that for bones to lie right up there is our line for the pole star and the jolly dollars. but by thunder if it dont make me cold inside to think of flint. theyre long bones and the hairs been yellow. great guns care killed a cat. its childs play to find the stuff now. well i reckon he was blue. stand by to go about. long after the voice had died away they still stared in silence dreadfully before them. he had been well brought up had dick before he came to sea and fell among bad companions. i never was feared of flint in his life and by the powers ill face him dead. theres seven hundred thousand pound not a quarter of a mile from here. he on his part had pretty well fought his weakness down. so with the second. but it was not its size that now impressed my companions it was the knowledge that seven hundred thousand pounds in gold lay somewhere buried below its spreading shadow. certainly he took no pains to hide his thoughts and certainly i read them like print. and suddenly not ten yards further we beheld them stop. a low cry arose. each of these six men was as though he had been struck. but with silver the blow passed almost instantly. i tell you now that man there knew it all along. one thing i observed which looked well for us they all got out upon the opposite side from silver. he was brave and no mistake. at last merry seemed to think a speech might help matters. but just then crack crack crack i tell you but silver was anxious to keep up with us. this was a run of eight or nine miles. at the top the squire met us. well then i will not. the floor was sand. youre too much of the born favourite for me. is that you john silver that was about our last doing on the island. the three fellows must have been watching us closer than we thought for as we soon had proved. the doctor hailed them and told them of the stores we had left and where they were to find them. silver was gone. five men only of those who had sailed returned with her. of silver we have heard no more. the bar silver and the arms still lie for all that i know where flint buried them and certainly they shall lie there for me. fancy if it had been a hard frost i never thought it would be so cold in the old country. the conversation proceeded. thats it she is hardly a relation at all so little in fact that i was not in the least surprised to have no answer to my letter. hm hm mrs. epanchin oh yes i know her. this sort of character is met with pretty frequently in a certain class. he was very absent he would appear to listen and heard nothing and he would laugh of a sudden evidently with no idea of what he was laughing about. hm i dont know im sure i believe i am the last and only one. i hardly know anyone in russia. theyve treated me like a dog but though there may have been something remarkable in the fact that this man was heir to millions of roubles there was something about him which surprised and interested the prince more than that. but why couldnt he let me know totskis the only man with any chance there. oh no i swear i was all of a blaze at once. they cost four hundred roubles more than i had so i gave my name and they trusted me. i tell you i hadnt a notion of what was about me or before me or below my feet all the way i saw nothing whatever. we went straight into her drawingroom and then she came out to us. why didnt i die there on the spot so he took me upstairs and locked me up and swore at me for an hour. so after awhile she brought the box and flew out at him. do by all means ha ha you shall have a dress coat best quality white waistcoat anything you like and your pocket shall be full of money. come and you shall go with me to nastasia philipovnas. thanks very much for the offer of clothes and a fur coat i certainly shall require both clothes and coat very soon. lebedeff had his desire. it was damp and wet. ii. he was undoubtedly clever. and also his luck seldom failed him even at cards for which he had a passion that he did not attempt to conceal. all three of the girls were decidedly pretty even the eldest alexandra who was just twentyfive years old. the eldest was musical while the second was a clever artist which fact she had concealed until lately. in a word the world spoke well of the girls but they were not without their enemies and occasionally people talked with horror of the number of books they had read. they were in no hurry to marry. they liked good society but were not too keen about it. the general lived on the first floor or flat of the house as modest a lodging as his position permitted. this second individual wore a dress coat and was some forty years of age he was the generals special study servant and well aware of his own importance. he looked at the prince in severe surprise as the latter settled himself in another chair alongside with his bundle on his knees. you are a visitor a guest so to speak. the prince was too unlike the usual run of daily visitors and although the general certainly did receive on business all sorts and conditions of men yet in spite of this fact the servant felt great doubts on the subject of this particular visitor. ha ha i know i cant smoke here of course. i dont think i should stay even if they were to invite me. i once wrote to your mistress from abroad but she did not reply. however i have thought it right to make acquaintance with her on my arrival. i am telling you all this in order to ease your mind for i see you are still far from comfortable on my account. if i am received very good if not well very good again. gavrila ardalionovitch oh no yes thats true enough. but all the preparations are so dreadful. isnt it a dreadful idea that he should have cried cried because it is said thou shalt not kill is he to be killed because he murdered some one else i assure you i saw the sight a month ago and its dancing before my eyes to this moment. clearly he was not at all anxious to bring the conversation to an end. who knows the man who is attacked by robbers at night in a dark wood or anywhere undoubtedly hopes and hopes that he may yet escape until the very moment of his death. you may place a soldier before a cannons mouth in battle and fire upon him and he will still hope. no no no no no you see they might come out and inquire for you and you wouldnt be on the spot. you see that door there the new arrival glanced at the prince out of the corners of his eyes. gavrila ardalionovitch listened attentively and gazed at the prince with great curiosity. gavrila ardalionovitch meanwhile seemed to be trying to recall something. you wish to see the general he even advanced a couple of steps to meet him. the prince came forward and introduced himself. i should not like to disturb you. i do not know your times and arrangements here you see but i have only just arrived. i came straight from the station. gania stood at his table in the far corner of the room turning over papers. you see i have not been in russia for four years and knew very little about anything when i left. i had been very ill for a long time and i feel now the need of a few good friends. in fact i have a certain question upon which i much need advice and do not know whom to go to for it. i can carry it in my hand easily. then it is perhaps as well that i neither did invite you nor do invite you now. excuse me prince but we had better make this matter clear once for all. oh well i suppose its all right especially as my letter was not answered. just now your servant outside there was dreadfully suspicious that i had come to beg of you. i noticed that i came to make some friends. not that i will ever believe there is nothing in common between any two people as some declare is the case. no at present i have no means whatever and no employment either but i hope to find some. i was living on other people abroad. i have always been an invalid and unable to learn much. it appeared that the general had known pavlicheff but why the latter had taken an interest in the prince that young gentleman could not explain probably by virtue of the old friendship with his father he thought. the general was much astonished. as for a situation i should much like to find one for i am anxious to discover what i really am fit for. in fact it is very necessary. its a charming room altogether. gania give the prince some paper. nastasia philipovna did she send it you herself i asked her for it long ago. as if she would hint thats not her way at all. you might have given her your portrait however. very likely she never will. i should think so shes twentyfive years old today oh i can do as i like there of course only my father will make a fool of himself as usual. i swear if it had not been for my mother i should have shown him the way out long ago. stuff and nonsense i should like to know who can reproach nastasia philipovna or who can say a word of any kind against her. did she mean because nastasia had been living with totski what nonsense it is you would not let her come near your daughters says nina alexandrovna. what next i wonder dont be annoyed with her. he finished at last and brought the result of his labour to the generals desk. the picture was certainly that of an unusually lovely woman. she was rather thin perhaps and a little pale. both gania and the general gazed at the prince in amazement. but now it is quite a different matter. the general who was really agitated and disturbed looked at the prince too but did not seem to expect much from his reply. he seemed to be still far from well. what you are to do is to be as agreeable towards her as ever you can. well what are you smiling at you must understand gania that i have no interest whatever in speaking like this. nothing will move totski from his resolution so i run no risk. if there is anything i desire you must know that it is your benefit only. cant you trust me the general grew purple with anger. but even now there is still time. do you understand me i wish to know whether you desire this arrangement or whether you do not if not say so and and welcome the general was satisfied. but he felt at ease in another moment it only needed one glance at the prince to see that in that quarter there was nothing to fear. how delightful in switzerland of all places now that is an ordinary english hand. sit down a minute. i have told you that i cannot receive you myself very often but i should like to be of some assistance to you some small assistance of a kind that would give you satisfaction. there you will be comfortable and well taken care of for i do not think prince that you are the sort of man to be left to the mercy of fate in a town like petersburg. taking so much interest in you as you may perceive i do i am not without my object and you shall know it in good time. i dont say that out of pride. i certainly did not know where to lay my head tonight. no no my good fellow. if she cannot receive you now you must be content to wait till another time. meanwhile you gania just look over these accounts will you the latter accepted the offer but did not talk being unwilling to disturb ganias work. he commenced to examine the study and its contents. suddenly gania approached our hero who was at the moment standing over nastasia philipovnas portrait gazing at it. he seemed to have some special object in the question. her eyes show it those two bones there the little points under her eyes just where the cheek begins. its a proud face too terribly proud and i i cant say whether she is good and kind or not. oh if she be but good certainly he would i should think. he would marry her tomorrow the prince immediately followed the man out of the room. iv. the young ladies used to have a cup of coffee each before this meal at ten oclock while still in bed. on the particular morning on which our story has opened the family had assembled in the diningroom and were waiting the generals appearance the latter having promised to come this day. his daughters advanced to kiss him too and though they did not look exactly angry there was something strange in their expression as well. might he suggest for instance such a thing as a marriage between himself and one of the generals daughters he knew life and realized what such an offer was worth. it made known that the eldest alexandra would very likely be disposed to listen to a proposal. alexandra was a goodnatured girl though she had a will of her own. what better could totski wish so the matter crept slowly forward. this circumstance had come into existence eighteen years before. he only stayed at his country seat a few days on this occasion but he had time to make his arrangements. within a fortnight totski himself arrived and from that time he appeared to have taken a great fancy to this part of the world and came down each summer staying two and three months at a time. in the first place this new woman understood a good deal more than was usual for young people of her age so much indeed that totski could not help wondering where she had picked up her knowledge. her character was absolutely changed. meanwhile totski thought the matter over as well as his scattered ideas would permit. she was pretty then... but now... she was now exceedingly pale but curiously this change only made her more beautiful. in this way he might gain glory in certain circles. five years of this petersburg life went by and of course during that time a great deal happened. he was afraid he did not know why but he was simply afraid of nastasia philipovna. for the first two years or so he had suspected that she wished to marry him herself and that only her vanity prevented her telling him so. he thought that she wanted him to approach her with a humble proposal from his own side. finally totski took cunning means to try to break his chains and be free. among these people she was much beloved. she received four or five friends sometimes of an evening. totski often came. and it was at this moment that general epanchin began to play so large and important a part in the story. so he and the general determined to try what an attempt to appeal to her heart would effect. he then pointed out that the fate of his daughter and very likely of both his other daughters now hung upon her reply. to nastasias question as to what they wished her to do totski confessed that he had been so frightened by her five years ago that he could never now be entirely comfortable until she herself married. he immediately added that such a suggestion from him would of course be absurd unless accompanied by remarks of a more pointed nature.  in fact all that would naturally be said under the circumstances. she confessed that she had long wished to have a frank and free conversation and to ask for friendly advice but that pride had hitherto prevented her now however that the ice was broken nothing could be more welcome to her than this opportunity. what was done was done and ended and she could not understand why totski should still feel alarmed. the idea alone that she could in any way serve them would be to her both a pride and a source of real happiness. she longed to rise if not to love at least to family life and new hopes and objects but as to gavrila ardalionovitch she could not as yet say much. would they like to receive her into their house she thanked him for his delicacy however but saw no reason why gavrila ardalionovitch should not know about it. she did not intend to ask forgiveness for anything in the past which fact she desired to be known. but the once bitten totski was twice shy and looked for hidden snakes among the flowers. before long nastasia and gania had talked the matter over. she said nothing about it though he daily expected her to do so. but at times he would pluck up his courage and be full of hope and good spirits again acting in fact as weak men do act in such circumstances. what he thought to gain by ganias marriage to the girl it was difficult to imagine. at all events the fact was known that he had prepared a magnificent present of pearls for nastasias birthday and that he was looking forward to the occasion when he should present his gift with the greatest excitement and impatience. the day before her birthday he was in a fever of agitation. mrs. epanchin was in the habit of holding herself very straight and staring before her without speaking in moments of excitement. her eyes were grey and wore a very curious expression at times. is he quiet when he has these fits his manners are excellent but here he is himself. receive him kindly please. theyll bring in lunch directly prince you must stop and have some but you must excuse me. aglaya stamped her foot. i want to have a good look at you. hm i like to see that you know your manners and you are by no means such a person as the general thought fit to describe you. alexandra adelaida look after the prince he doesnt seem so very ill does he eat away prince and tell me where you were born and where you were brought up. mrs. epanchin became more and more pleased with her guest the girls too listened with considerable attention. i dont work too much either. here we are now sit down prince near the fire and talk to us. i want to hear you relate something. i wish you to know all the good people and to interest them. whats there strange about it he has a tongue. this was after a long series of fits. this would continue for three or four days and then i would recover myself again. how strange yet it is not strange. anyone of us might fall in love with a donkey what are you laughing at aglaya and you too adelaida all three of the girls laughed out loud and the prince laughed with them. all laughed again. oh ive been two years looking out for a good subject for a picture. ive done all i know. open your eyes and look if you cant see here you wont see abroad either. you see i only went to restore my health. i dont know whether i learned to see exactly. it fell from a great height but it looked quite low and it was half a mile away though it did not seem fifty paces. i loved to listen to it at night but it was then that i became so restless. she talks of nothing but money all day. then a group of soldiers took their stand opposite to each post. a priest went about among them with a cross and there was about five minutes of time left for him to live. he remembered having divided his time like this quite well. he wished to put it to himself as quickly and clearly as possible that here was he a living thinking man and that in three minutes he would be nobody or if somebody or something then what and where he thought he would decide this question once for all in these last three minutes. what if i were to return to life again i asked him myself. you could draw a moral from either and be quite satisfied. what has your little finger to do with it the prince talks well though he is not amusing. he happened to look in my direction i saw his eyes and understood all at once but how am i to describe it i do so wish you or somebody else could draw it you if possible. i thought at the time what a picture it would make. you must imagine all that went before of course all all. what is it
he says. and yet i believe these people give them a good breakfast out of pure kindness of heart and believe that they are doing a good action. i think he too must feel that he has an age to live still while they cart him along. probably he thought on the way oh i have a long long time yet. three streets of life yet when weve passed this street therell be that other one and then that one where the bakers shop is on the right and when shall we get there there was a priest with him the whole time talking even in the cart as they drove along he talked and talked. probably the other heard nothing he would begin to listen now and then and at the third word or so he had forgotten all about it. the priest who seemed to be a wise man had stopped talking now and only held the cross for the wretched fellow to kiss. if some dreadful thing were suddenly to happen if a house were just about to fall on one dont you know how one would long to sit down and shut ones eyes and wait and wait well when this terrible feeling came over him the priest quickly pressed the cross to his lips without a word a little silver cross it was and he kept on pressing it to the mans lips every second. and so up to the very block. and imagine some people declare that when the head flies off it is conscious of having flown off fancy if consciousness were to last for even five seconds the prince gazed at her in amazement. dont deny the fact for you did of course. dont think anything of their nonsense it means nothing. but the prince was silent and serious. all awaited his reply. no no they were the children of the village in which i lived and they went to the school there all of them. i wished for nothing better i used to tell them everything and hid nothing from them. the schoolmaster was my greatest enemy in the end i had many enemies and all because of the children. what were they afraid of one can tell a child everything anything. i have often been struck by the fact that parents know their children so little. they should not conceal so much from them. how well even little children understand that their parents conceal things from them because they consider them too young to understand children are capable of giving advice in the most important matters. i call them birds because there is nothing in the world better than birds i remember there was one poor fellow at our professors who was being treated for madness and you have no idea what those children did for him eventually. i dont think he was mad but only terribly unhappy. but ill tell you all about him another day. now i must get on with this story. she belonged to our village. the old woman was ill and very old and could hardly move. she never had been pretty even before but her eyes were quiet innocent kind eyes. cruel people her mother was the first to show the way. everyone looked at her as though she were a piece of dirt off the road. the old men scolded and condemned and the young ones laughed at her. she would not even speak to her. she made her sleep on straw in a shed and hardly gave her food enough to support life. the men seemed to consider her no longer a woman they said such dreadful things to her. he considered that he was being very kind. who is she her daughter and so on to the end. i would have kissed hers but she drew it away. just at this moment the whole troop of children saw us. i found out afterwards that they had long kept a watch upon me. the children would not let her pass now in the streets but annoyed her and threw dirt at her more than before. they said she had burst into tears and that they loved her very much now. they often came to me and begged me to tell them stories. i think i must have told stories well for they did so love to hear them. at last i took to reading up interesting things on purpose to pass them on to the little ones and this went on for all the rest of my time there three years. one has only to remember ones own childhood to admit the truth of this. and what delicacy and tenderness they showed there was a spot there which was quite closed in and hidden from view by large trees and to this spot the children used to come to me. i cant understand how they managed it but they did it all together. when i asked them about it they only laughed and shouted and the little girls clapped their hands and kissed me. she had become very ill and could hardly walk. she used to sit on a stone near and wait there almost motionless all day till the herd went home. i always found her sitting just like that. i did not take my hand away because it made her happy to have it and so she would sit and cry quietly. sometimes she tried to speak but it was very difficult to understand her. occasionally the children came with me when they did so they would stand some way off and keep guard over us so as to tell me if anybody came near. this was a great pleasure to them. one day she could not go out at all and remained at home all alone in the empty hut but the children very soon became aware of the fact and nearly all of them visited her that day as she lay alone and helpless in her miserable bed. thanks to them i assure you the girl died almost perfectly happy. the day before her death i went to see her for the last time just before sunset. i think she recognized me for she pressed my hand. however when it came to carrying the coffin all the children rushed up to carry it themselves. of course they could not do it alone but they insisted on helping and walked alongside and behind crying. afterwards i came closer than ever to those little souls but even then it was very dear to me to have them so fond of me. and what did he mean by my system he said afterwards that he believed i was a child myself just before i came away. however kind people may be to me i never feel quite at home with them and am always glad to get back to my little companions. i stopped and laughed happily as i watched their little feet moving so quickly. girls and boys laughing and crying for as they went home many of them found time to fight and make peace to weep and play. i forgot my troubles in looking at them. i lived the life of a child there and thought i should never leave the little village indeed i was far from thinking that i should ever return to russia. i am going to see now if can get good advice about it. perhaps my lot in life will be changed but that is not the principal thing. the principal thing is the entire change that has already come over me. i left many things behind me too many. they have gone. on the journey i said to myself i am going into the world of men. people may consider me a child if they like. i am often called an idiot and at one time i certainly was so ill that i was nearly as bad as an idiot but i am not an idiot now. how can i possibly be so when i know myself that i am considered one it was very very painful getting that first little letter. how melancholy they had been when they saw me off the whole flock went with me to the station which was about a mile from the village and every now and then one of them would stop to throw his arms round me and all the little girls had tears in their voices though they tried hard not to cry. it is not that i do not value your society and you must never suppose that i have taken offence at anything. thats what i read in your face. your heart is undoubtedly a kind good one but you are not merry. so much for your face. have i guessed right dont be angry with me for saying so you know what my feelings for children are. oh dear no it is by no means the case well done prince i assure you the general actually asked me to put you through your paces and examine you. as to what you said about my face you are absolutely correct in your judgment. i am a child and know it. i knew it long before you said so you have expressed my own thoughts. i think your nature and mine must be extremely alike and i am very glad of it. we shall see. i have not prepared my judgment. where have you seen nastasia philipovna if she gave it to him he must have it and he is still in the study. send for gavrila ardalionovitch at once. no i dont long to see him so much. look here dear prince be so kind will you just step to the study and fetch this portrait say we want to look at it. i think you are a great deal more foolish than he is. he is simple of course but also very knowing. gavrila ardalionovitch was still sitting in the study buried in a mass of papers. the prince reminded him of the portrait. the prince waited quietly. he took up the portrait and went out of the room. gania left alone clutched his head with his hands. it was partly the fact of her marvellous beauty that struck him and partly something else. the prince gazed at it for a minute or two then glanced around him and hurriedly raised the portrait to his lips. when a minute after he reached the drawingroom door his face was quite composed. but just as he reached the door he met aglaya coming out alone. aglaya stopped took the letter and gazed strangely into the princes eyes. there was no confusion in her face a little surprise perhaps but that was all. at length a faint smile passed over her face and she passed by him without a word. i have seen her twice but only at a distance. just then aglaya entered the room. mrs.
epanchin rang the bell. as if you can possibly like it yourself perhaps sense is really the great thing. dont smile like that aglaya. a fool with a heart and no brains is just as unhappy as a fool with brains and no heart. enough of words now goodbye now you have a good deal to do im sure and i must dress and go out. take your portrait. give my respects to your unfortunate mother nina alexandrovna. i shall go and see her on purpose. and listen my dear boy i feel sure that god has sent you to petersburg from switzerland on purpose for me. god sent you to me gania confused annoyed furious took up his portrait and turned to the prince with a nasty smile on his face. if you have not changed your mind as to living with us perhaps you would like to come with me. she did not so much as look at gania. you lie if you deny it. who else could have told them devil take it sir who could have told them except yourself but at this moment aglaya came back and the prince had no time to reply. now choose a page and write me something will you theres a pen a new one do you mind a steel one how beautifully you have written it thanks so much. arrived at the diningroom she stopped. say one more such word and save me from utter ruin. only tell me break off the whole thing and i will do so this very day. oh what can it cost you to say just this one word in doing so you will but be giving me a sign of your sympathy for me and of your pity only this only this nothing more nothing. but if you say but this word i will take up my cross again with joy and return once more to my battle with poverty. he must know that if he broke off everything first by himself and without telling me a word about it or having the slightest hope on my account that in that case i should perhaps be able to change my opinion of him and even accept his friendship. he must know that but his soul is such a wretched thing. he immediately began to hope at that very moment. i saw it. he has tried to catch me ever since he is still fishing for me. well enough of this. thats the best answer. gania stamped his foot with impatience. his face looked dark and gloomy with rage. at last they left the house behind them the prince carrying his bundle. gania was struck motionless with amazement. i might have guessed it oh curse him of course she did not understand what i meant naturally you are lying. thats all i think. oh we shall see we shall see so the pair walked along a few steps. gania did not stand on ceremony with the prince he behaved just as though he were alone in his room. gania looked at him with angry contempt. devil take it what did you do in there why did they fancy you look here cant you remember exactly what you said to them from the very beginning so come along to your house after all. the flat occupied by gania and his family was on the third floor of the house. gania frowned upon the idea. but if he had made up his mind to put up with this sort of life for a while it was only on the plain understanding with his inner self that he would very soon change it all and have things as he chose again. the prince was given the middle room of the three the first being occupied by one ferdishenko while the third was empty. she was very like her mother she even dressed like her which proved that she had no taste for smart clothes. the expression of her grey eyes was merry and gentle when it was not as lately too full of thought and anxiety. the present visitor ptitsin was also afraid of her. he could speak well but preferred silence. on the whole he made a decidedly agreeable impression. he was a great friend of ganias. we only have a cook and one maid so i have to help as much as i can. she seemed put out and was only just polite with the prince. you can take your dinner with us or have it in your room just as you please. colia whispered something in his ear and went out. youll see. what a wretched room this is dark and the window looking into the yard. however its not my affair. he opened the door just enough to let his head in. he stood on the threshold and examined the prince carefully. he then looked over to the other side of the room and around it. ferdishenko rose. i dont intend to. thanks. i live here next door to you you noticed a room did you dont come to me very often i shall see you here quite often enough. his appearance would have been distinguished had it not been that he gave the idea of being rather dirty. i heard the familiar name the dear familiar name and oh he sat down and taking the princes hand drew him to a seat next to himself. oh your mother your mother youth youth the prince noticed the fact and was furious. he came and woke me at seven oclock one morning. i rise and dress in amazement silence on both sides. i understand it all. the prince rose to go but the general once more laid his hand in a friendly manner on his shoulder and dragged him down on to the sofa. i suffered without a trial i had no trial. i hardly talk to gania now and avoid him as much as i can. the prince rose and followed her but hardly had they reached the drawingroom and nina alexandrovna had begun to talk hurriedly when in came the general. the master of the house may have observed this but at all events he did not take any notice of it he was in high good humour. it was a mysterious an impossible business one might say very well. well it was as i said a strange almost impossible affair. all as it should be is it not do you remember any case at all like it everybody was at their wits end. it is of course a most curious case nearly an impossible one. the two ladies listened intently. gania stood and frowned he expected a family scene. you need not worry yourself gania i shall ask you no questions. you need not tell me anything you dont like. gania was surprised but cautiously kept silence and looked at his mother hoping that she would express herself more clearly. there shall be no more tears nor questions not from my side at all events. all i wish is that you may be happy you know that. it was not for my own sake that i have been so anxious and worried all this time they say it is all to be settled today. how can she give her consent and make you a present of her portrait when you do not love her we had better drop the subject we had really. i shall never leave you mother any other man would cut and run from such a sister as this. see how she is looking at me at this moment you can go at once for all i care i am sick enough of your company. the prince took down the chain and opened the door. he started back in amazement for there stood nastasia philipovna. nastasia had thrown it off her towards the prince expecting him to catch it but the prince had missed it. however he moved off towards the drawingroom with the cloak over his arm. ha ha ha when she burst out laughing he smiled but his tongue could not form a word as yet. ptitsin was taking her part too. not that varia was afraid of standing up for herself. her usual practice in such cases as the present was to say nothing but stare at him without taking her eyes off his face for an instant. silence immediately fell on the room all looked at the prince as though they neither understood nor hoped to understand. gania was motionless with horror. in the first place she had never been before. up to now she had been so haughty that she had never even asked gania to introduce her to his parents. of late she had not so much as mentioned them. he would have borne anything from her rather than this visit. but one thing seemed to him quite clear her visit now and the present of her portrait on this particular day pointed out plainly enough which way she intended to make her decision gania darted a terrible glance of wrath at her for this but nina alexandrovna mended matters a little when gania introduced her at last. dont you use a study she did not sit down but stood by her mother with folded hands. he let go of the prince and burst out laughing. he a prince forgive me do who is he did you say what prince where had you seen me before and why were you so struck dumb at the sight of me my word what things i would say if i had such a chance as that i have not seen you i never was here before. he was evidently much agitated. a question flashed through his mind as to whether the game was really worth the candle. what else had she come for there were his mother and his sister sitting before her and she seemed to have forgotten their very existence already and if she behaved like that he thought she must have some object in view. ferdishenko led the general up to nastasia philipovna. a nice papa you are oh no i have wished to see him too long for that. why what business can he have on the contrary it seemed to increase. what was that i was alone in the carriage. i took no notice just went on smoking. i observed that the ladies were getting angry over my cigar doubtless. if they didnt like the cigar why couldnt they say so not a word not a hint out of the window with it ptitsin laughed too though he had been very sorry to see the general appear. well everybody knows what great friends the princess and mrs. epanchin are so there was a pretty kettle of fish. ferdishenko was the only one who laughed as gaily as before. as to gania i need not say that he was miserable he stood dumb and wretched and took no notice of anybody. his eyes shone with a blaze of hatred. some most unusual visitor must have arrived. colia ran to open. several voices were talking and shouting at once others were talking and shouting on the stairs outside it was evidently a most extraordinary visit that was about to take place. everyone exchanged startled glances. gania rushed out towards the diningroom but a number of men had already made their way in and met him. there was no room for doubt in the princes mind one of the voices was rogojins and the other lebedeffs. none of them were quite drunk but all appeared to be considerably excited. all the rest were merely chorus brought in to support the chief character. but at this moment he saw seated before him nastasia philipovna. he had not dreamed of meeting her here evidently for her appearance produced a marvellous effect upon him. he grew pale and his lips became actually blue. his followers entered after him and all paused a moment at sight of the ladies. why its only three months since i lost two hundred roubles of my fathers money to you at cards. the old fellow died before he found out. ptitsin knows all about it. why ive come now at this moment to buy you up i have lots of money my beauty enough to buy up you and all yours together. so i shall if i like to ill buy you up dont turn me out say one word do he awaited the reply in deadly anxiety. and they told me oh nastasia philipovna they said you had promised to marry him him as if you could do it give him a thousand or three if he likes poor devil and hed cut and run the day before his wedding and leave his bride to me youd take three thousand wouldnt you heres the money rogojins troop who were only waiting for an excuse set up a howl at this. lebedeff stepped forward and whispered something in parfens ear. gania watched the whole scene with a sinking of the heart. ptitsin and another have promised to find me forty thousand roubles by seven oclock tonight. nina alexandrovna and varia had both risen from their places and were waiting in silent horror to see what would happen. a hundred thousand paid this very day. ptitsin find it for me. you shall have a hundred thousand this very day. take what you like for it but get it by the evening she was shaking and trembling with rage. between him and varia stood the prince. colia rushed up to comfort the prince and after him crowded varia rogojin and all even the general. nastasia philipovna looked surprised and smiled but evidently concealed something beneath her smile and with some confusion and a glance at gania she left the room. however she had not reached the outer hall when she turned round walked quickly up to nina alexandrovna seized her hand and lifted it to her lips. then she turned again and left the room so quickly that no one could imagine what she had come back for. all they saw was that she said something to nina alexandrovna in a hurried whisper and seemed to kiss her hand. varia however both saw and heard all and watched nastasia out of the room with an expression of wonder. he followed her to the stairs. they were all talking at once. the prince now left the room and shut himself up in his own chamber. the poor boy seemed to be already so attached to him that he could hardly leave him. but i have a great friend who is much worse off even than we are. i will tell you all about him some day.... what do you think of nastasia philipovna she is beautiful isnt she i had never seen her before though i had a great wish to do so. i could forgive gania if he were to marry her for love but for money oh dear after what you... but i do hate that way of looking at things varia is afraid of no one. here she comes speak of a wolf and you see his tail i felt sure that she would come. it is the worst thing about her. after all i believe father may have started off with rogojin. no doubt he is sorry now. gania is worried and ashamed not without reason what a spectacle you guessed right i fancy. evidently she meant to hurt and insult us. i have heard curious tales about her before now but if she came to invite us to her house why did she behave so to my mother ptitsin knows her very well he says he could not understand her today. with rogojin too the prince was considerably amazed and did not reply at once. and where on earth did i get the idea that you were an idiot they are all enemies and think what she must take you for gania i know she kissed mothers hand and all that but she laughed at you all the same. oh do take care what you are doing i shall certainly marry her. i was not quite sure of myself before but now i am. of course i know very little about it but thats my view. i was alarmed at first but i have thought better of it now she was simply laughing at him. im not going to pretend anything and youll see shell marry me all right. if she likes to live quietly so she shall but if she gives me any of her nonsense i shall leave her at once but i shall keep the money. she thinks she will be able to make a sort of slave of me all my life but i shall prepare a little surprise for her. are you laughing the prince seeing that he did not quite like the last remark blushed and was silent too. do you know that he keeps a mistress or perhaps the one about his grey horse that talked you came to make friends with me again just now and you said i will kiss your hand if you like just as a child would have said it. well i shall be spared such a hard beginning and shall start with a little capital. do you know i could have knocked you down for that just now i will do it once i am rich i shall be a genius an extremely original man. you will say that this is childish or romantic. well that will be all the better for me but the thing shall be done. i will carry it through. why does epanchin insult me however enough for the present. colia has put his nose in to tell us dinner is ready twice. im dining out. i shall come and talk to you now and then you shall be comfortable enough with us. they are sure to make you one of the family. i think you and i will either be great friends or enemies. havent you put a drop of poison in that remark now eh by the way ha ha ha come its all right. im not going to laugh at you. believe it or not as you like. you think she and totski not a bit of it not a bit of it not for ever so long at length colia popped his head in once more. the prince read it rose and took his hat. i do you mean me often my friend often i only pretended i had not in order to avoid a painful subject. i wished to ask you whether you could show me the way to nastasia philipovnas tonight. i must go i have business with her i was not invited but i was introduced. capital the prince was in despair. at last he rose and declared that he would wait no longer. muishkin began to despair. he could not imagine how he had been so foolish as to trust this man. he insisted that all his troubles were caused by their bad conduct and time alone would put an end to them. you dont believe it the government knows all about it. one of my old friends lives on the first floor with his large family. and yet... well... you look as if you didnt believe me.... well now why should i not present the son of my old friend and companion to this delightful family general ivolgin and prince muishkin you will see a lovely girl what am i saying a lovely girl no indeed two three no bad thing eh... general ivolgin and prince muishkin. now come this is the house up this magnificent staircase. why have they not got rid of him but to his horror he saw that general ivolgin was quite familiar with the house and really seemed to have friends there. what a pity hearing the names she came forward with a look of suspicion on her face. would you believe it i am always so unfortunate she will remember. yes i certainly was at fault. go alone you dont know ivolgin my friend. a visit to her is merely an affair of a few minutes i am quite at home in her house. make up your mind to spend the evening with me.... we are just there thats the house... why colia you here he is worse and has been in bed all day. i came down to buy some cards. he wanted colia but firmly resolved to leave the general behind. he could not forgive himself for being so simple as to imagine that ivolgin would be of any use. i wish to present him general ivolgin and prince muishkin but whats the matter... what... she is ready to eat you up you have not shown yourself since the day before yesterday and she is expecting the money. why did you promise her any you are always the same the surprise of the generals imagination fell very flat for she at once began to address him in terms of reproach. i knew it was he but it was more serious than he wished to think. are you not ashamed how long shall i be your victim here is... the prince muishkin answer heart of stone and now he has come he is drunk he can scarcely stand. the general meant to have said much more but as soon as he had stretched himself out he turned his face to the wall and slept the sleep of the just. will you show me the way for i do not know the street she does not live there and to tell you the truth my father has never been to her house will you go directly alas the latter had no money to pay for a cab so they were obliged to walk. he is ill and has been in bed all day. that of course makes a great difference. what is a terrible disgrace to a woman does not disgrace a man at least not in the same way. it really would be happier for him to die young. if i were in his place i should certainly long for death. he is unhappy about his brother and sisters the children you saw. it is our dream. but do you know when i was talking over your affair with him he was angry and said that anyone who did not call out a man who had given him a blow was a coward. if she will receive me so much the better. if not the matter is ended. especially here in our dear russia. how it has happened i never can understand. to get money the press seized upon the story of course and now it is public property. look at my father the general see what he is and yet i assure you he is an honest man yes thats true i pity him to tell the truth but i dare not say so because everybody would laugh at me but i do pity him and who are the really clever men after all as to my mother i really do admire her yes and honour her. hm you call that being strong and good i will remember that gania knows nothing about it. then shall we three live together you and i and hippolyte i am really rather worried just now. what are we there already is that the house what a long flight of steps dont be afraid. i wish you success we agree so entirely that i can do so although i do not understand why you are here. but as to your getting in dont be in the least afraid. you will see her. she is so original about everything. its the first floor. but there was another question which terrified him considerably and that was what was he going to do when he did get in and to this question he could fashion no satisfactory reply. he does not love you he only loves your money. then again there was another delicate question to which he could not find an answer dared not in fact think of it but at the very idea of which he trembled and blushed. in the first place there were present totski and general epanchin. ptitsin was able to afford some particulars as to rogojins conduct since the afternoon. he declared that he had been busy finding money for the latter ever since and up to nine oclock rogojin having declared that he must absolutely have a hundred thousand roubles by the evening. all this news was received by the company with somewhat gloomy interest. nastasia was silent and would not say what she thought about it. the general seemed the most anxious of all and decidedly uneasy. ferdishenko was the only person present in good spirits. i am neither. then i remember and take my revenge. of course he never does so himself. i know how to keep my place. how can anyone possibly receive such a man as i am i quite understand. there is one explanation only one. those who wished to go to her house were forced to put up with ferdishenko. nastasia noticed this with satisfaction. she took his hand and led him towards her other guests. i did so wish to come and see you. i think what they say about you must be true that you are so original. totski immediately made some amiable remark. nastasia made the prince sit down next to herself. it was extremely difficult to account for nastasias strange condition of mind which became more evident each moment and which none could avoid noticing. but he was to be honest that was the chief point we must draw lots its a very simple game all you have to do is to tell the story of the worst action of your life. its as simple as anything. her eyes were blazing and her cheeks showed two bright red spots against the white. at all events she was attracted by the idea and gradually her guests came round to her side the thing was original at least and might turn out to be amusing. but now gentlemen to business ferdishenko was first then ptitsin then the general totski next his own fifth then gania and so on the ladies did not draw. well gentlemen i suppose i must set a good example besides which am i to choose totski sat looking miserable enough. now prince what do you think are there not far more thieves than honest men in this world as for my story gentlemen it is too stupid and absurd to tell you. he had a dinner party. after dinner the men stayed at the table over their wine. it struck me to ask the daughter of the house to play something on the piano so i passed through the corner room to join the ladies. she must have taken it out for some purpose and left it lying there. there was no one about. i took up the note and put it in my pocket why i cant say. i sat and waited there in a great state of excitement. i talked hard and told lots of stories and laughed like mad then i joined the ladies. ones worst actions always are mean. we shall see what the general has to say for himself now. strange as it may appear he had expected much better success for his story. he realized that he had gone a little too far. she lived in a wretched little wooden house and had not even a servant so poor was she. she was sitting in a corner all alone leaning her face on her hand. you old wretch i yelled and all that sort of thing in real russian style. i looked at her and she stared back with her eyes starting out of her head but she did not say a word. i used to dream of the poor old woman at nights. i said to myself this woman this human being lived to a great age. at last god calls her to himself. i repeat that i wonder at myself for after all i was not really responsible. why did she take it into her head to die at that moment there thats all. totski was a handsome man rather stout with a very polite and dignified manner. he was always well dressed and his linen was exquisite. he had plump white hands and wore a magnificent diamond ring on one finger. in such circumstances there can of course be no doubt. what is it
i ask. but an idea got hold of me somehow. i dont know how. it was nearly two in the morning. he came. i gave him a tip of fifteen roubles and told him to get the carriage ready at once. in half an hour it was at the door. i got in and off we went. not a bit of it he says. dont say so dont think what youre doing i cried its a matter of life and death if thats the case take them says he. i pull out a hundred roubles. ah he says thats quite a different matter thats good of you and generous. of course poor peter had no chance after this. why did i do it all present watched both of them with curiosity. tell me what you think. shall i marry or not the general was struck dumb. all present started and listened intently. there were a few seconds of dead silence. in the first place what do you mean by before company isnt the company good enough for you and whats all that about a game i wished to tell my little story and i told it dont you like it you heard what i said to the prince as you decide so it shall be if he had said yes i should have given my consent but he said no so i refused. here was my whole life hanging on his one word what on earth has the prince got to do with it i let you go free for nothing take your freedom you must need it. all felt that something had happened something had gone very far wrong indeed but no one could make head or tail of the matter. at this moment there was a furious ring at the bell and a great knock at the door exactly similar to the one which had startled the company at ganias house in the afternoon. she sat quite still but watched the door in a fever of impatience. let them in or theyll come in whether you like or no. listen what a noise they are making perhaps you are offended gentlemen that i should receive such guests in your presence there was nobody who would be likely to feel much alarm. general epanchin alone determined to depart. in short he plainly showed his conviction that a man in his position could have nothing to do with rogojin and his companions. but nastasia interrupted him at his first words. i wont insist on keeping you against your will although i should have liked you to be beside me now. you should shut the door on the lot in my opinion. none of the band were very drunk for the leader had kept his intended visit to nastasia in view all day and had done his best to prevent his followers from drinking too much. so many things were entirely new to their experience the choice furniture the pictures the great statue of venus. a few only of whom lebedeff made one stood their ground he had contrived to walk side by side with rogojin for he quite understood the importance of a man who had a fortune of a million odd roubles and who at this moment carried a hundred thousand in his hand. this was a paper packet some six or seven inches thick and eight or nine in length wrapped in an old newspaper and tied round three or four times with string. lebedeff stood two or three paces behind his chief and the rest of the band waited about near the door. so he kept his word theres a man for you well sit down please take that chair. i shall have something to say to you presently. who are all these with you the same party let them come in and sit down. theres room on that sofa there are some chairs and theres another sofa but when he observed that the prince was seated beside nastasia philipovna he could not take his eyes off him for a long while and was clearly amazed. he could not account for the princes presence there. and he has kept his word see my goodness how white he is all this happened this afternoon at ganias. i had gone to pay his mother a visit my future family you know not quite good form eh oh nonsense i see you are still angry with me gania why surely you never really wished to take me into your family me rogojins mistress of course you would never go with this wretched fellow in spite of his hundred thousand roubles take his money and kick him out of the house thats the way to treat him and the likes of him she was very angry now. i saw his mother and kissed her hand too. i came and stirred up all that fuss gania this afternoon on purpose to see how much you could swallow you surprised me my friend you did indeed. and rogojin you almost brought your sister too. well what should you get but disgrace and misery if you took a wife you hated into your family for i know very well that you do hate me no no no no oh what a tongue i am having a day out you know its my birthday i have long looked forward to this happy occasion. is he worth it he is only just what he ought to be nothing particular. he thinks i am to blame too. money my word what a lot of money he spent over me and he tried to find me an honest husband first and then this gania here. and what do you think i might have married long ago not gania oh no i meant mischief i confess but i could have had him i give you my word he asked me himself. but i thought no no and who would take me without anything ask gania there whether he would. i know him. perhaps though what they say about him may be true that hes an we know what. i times are changed now dear prince the world sees things as they really are. thats all nonsense. besides how can you marry i have seen nothing. i am a nobody. you have suffered you have passed through hell and emerged pure and that is very much. nastasia philipovna i love you i would die for you. i shall never let any man say one word against you nastasia philipovna then ptitsin spoke. ferdishenko could not sit still. rogojin fixed his eyes first on the prince and then on ptitsin and then back again he was extremely agitated. lebedeff could not stand it. ptitsin explained for the benefit of the company that the princes aunt had died five months since. a year since it had so happened that his only two sons had both died within the same month. this sad event had so affected the old man that he too had died very shortly after. for the moment even nastasia philipovna was forgotten. but gradually the consciousness crept back into the minds of each one present that the prince had just made her an offer of marriage. she continued to sit still in her place looking around at her guests with a strange bewildered expression as though she were trying to collect her thoughts and could not. i didnt expect this. what are you all standing up for gentlemen im going to be married did you hear to the prince. he has a million and a half of roubles he is prince muishkin and has asked me to marry him. here prince come and sit by me and here comes the wine. nastasia philipovna overheard the remark and burst out laughing. i am the princess now you know. the prince wont let you insult me. i shall be able to sit at table with your new wife now. you see what i gain by marrying a prince a million and a half and a prince and an idiot into the bargain they say. what better could i wish for rogojin you are a little too late. all around burst out laughing. this moment if i could you laughed at these words and others around us laughed as well i heard them. it is impossible that your life should be altogether ruined at your age. why do you continually remind us of these facts i assure you once more that very few could find it in them to act as you have acted this day. totski took his hat and rose to go. what do you think of what the prince has just been saying you rogojin wait a moment dont go yet i see you dont intend to move however. perhaps i may go with you yet. rogojin simply stood staring with trembling lips not daring to believe his ears. hes fond of children. come along rogojin get your money ready we wont talk about marrying just at this moment but lets see the money at all events. come i may not marry you either. i dont know. i suppose you thought youd keep the money if i did ha ha ha nonsense i have no sense of shame left. as for what you say about my doing you honour by marrying you well totski can tell you all about that. you are all like this. all were standing up now. nastasia was absolutely beside herself. what sort of a wife should i make for you after all i have said rogojin cut a better dash than you did. but now i must be off ive been in prison for ten years. im free at last well rogojin what are you waiting for all of you fellows wine round with it gania too stood hat in hand ready to go but seemed to be unable to tear his eyes away from the scene before him. i may kick you out for all you know i havent taken your money yet there it all is on the table. here give me over that packet is there a hundred thousand roubles in that one packet oh why he needs a nurse himself the general there will be his nurse now youll see. here prince look here and you wished to marry her what are you crying about never mind you shall laugh yet. oh i made an honest girl like you serve a low woman like myself. its better so prince it is indeed. oh how foolish it would be too no no wed better say goodbye and part friends. i used to think so much down there that i nearly went mad and then this fellow here would come down. i wish to look into your heart once more for the last time. youve worried me for the last three months now its my turn. do you see this packet you must have bare hands and you must turn your sleeves up. pull it out i say and its all yours. i shall so much admire you if you put your hands into the fire for my money. if you dont get it out it shall burn. i will let no one else come away get away all of you its my money rogojin has bought me with it. no sooner did a tongue of flame burst out than she threw the packet of notes upon it. everyone gasped some even crossed themselves. some jumped up on chairs in order to get a better view. the beautiful german disappeared altogether. my queen let me get into the fire after it say the word ill put my whole grey head into the fire for it i have a poor lame wife and thirteen children. gania what are you standing there for dont stand on ceremony. put in your hand the crowd parted on each side of him and he was left face to face with nastasia philipovna three paces from her. she stood by the fire and waited with her intent gaze fixed upon him. he did not move from his place. in a few seconds it became evident to all that he did not intend to rescue the money. he could not take his eyes off nastasia. he stood drinking her in as it were. he was in the seventh heaven of delight. nearly the whole of the outer covering was burned away but it was soon evident that the contents were hardly touched. all breathed more freely. all right hell come to directly he must have the packet or hell cut his throat afterwards. there hes coming to himself. general totski all of you did you hear me the money is all ganias. tell him so. let it lie here beside him. off we go rogojin i have seen a man for the first time in my life. in the hall the servants were waiting and handed her her fur cloak. martha the cook ran in from the kitchen. nastasia kissed them all round. where where are you going to i dont know. give him my respects. drop her prince you see what sort of a woman she is. he shook himself free and rushed on downstairs. amid his new thoughts and ideas there came once or twice the image of nastasia philipovna. the general sighed. mad mad and you think there was something of this sort here do you but you must have observed my dear ptitsin that i did all i possibly could. i could do no more than i did. and you must admit that there are some rare qualities in this woman. such a woman could make anyone forget all reason everything my god yet in spite of all efforts in spite of all education even all those gifts are wasted in fact for a month or so after his departure it was considered not the thing to mention the princes name in the epanchin household. the general was unusually busy his family hardly ever saw him. as to the girls nothing was said openly at all events and probably very little in private. but they understood each other thoroughly at the first word on all occasions very often at the first glance so that there was no need of much talking as a rule. for instance the whole of the rogojin troop had departed with him at their head for moscow. as soon as he had recovered however he threw up his situation in the public company under general epanchins direction for some unknown reason and the post was given to another. we may mention that gania was no longer mentioned in the epanchin household any more than the prince was but that a certain circumstance in connection with the fatal evening at nastasias house became known to the general and in fact to all the family the very next day. this fact was that gania had come home that night but had refused to go to bed. however a week later she received another letter from the same source and at last resolved to speak. the girls could see that their mother concealed a great deal from them and left out large pieces of the letter in reading it to them. however the ice was broken and it suddenly became possible to mention the princes name again. and again it became evident how very strong was the impression the young man had made in the household by his one visit there. as soon as the ice was thus broken the general lost no time in showing that he too took the greatest interest in the subject. he admitted that he was interested but said that it was merely in the business side of the question. all this caused the general to look grave and important. but alas this agreeable state of affairs very soon changed once more. a couple of weeks went by and suddenly the general and his wife were once more gloomy and silent and the ice was as firm as ever. varia however informed the girls of what had happened she having received the news from ptitsin who generally knew more than most people. to make an end we may say that there were many changes in the epanchin household in the spring so that it was not difficult to forget the prince who sent no news of himself. the marriage between alexandra and totski had been broken off. the general however regretted totski for a long while. prince s   made the acquaintance of the generals family and adelaida the second girl made a great impression upon him. towards the spring he proposed to her and she accepted him. the general and his wife were delighted. the journey abroad was put off and the wedding was fixed for a day not very distant. the trip abroad might have been enjoyed later on by mrs. epanchin and her two remaining daughters but for another circumstance. this young gentleman no sooner set eyes on aglaya than he became a frequent visitor at the house. his past reputation was the only thing against him. nothing was said there were not even any hints dropped but still it seemed better to the parents to say nothing more about going abroad this season at all events. aglaya herself perhaps was of a different opinion. all this happened just before the second appearance of our hero upon the scene. colia ivolgin for some time after the princes departure continued his old life. the event showed that he was mistaken. ptitsin and varia declared that he was in the right place and gania was of the same opinion. it seemed now that gania really needed his brother and the latter for his part felt as if he could forgive gania much since he had returned the hundred thousand roubles offered to him by nastasia philipovna. three months after the departure of the prince the ivolgin family discovered that colia had made acquaintance with the epanchins and was on very friendly terms with the daughters. varia heard of it first though colia had not asked her to introduce him. little by little the family grew quite fond of him. perhaps you have quite forgotten me now how is it that i am writing to you how many times i have needed all three of you but only you have dwelt always in my minds eye. i need you i need you very much. i will not write about myself. i have nothing to tell you. but i long for you to be happy. are you happy it would be difficult to describe her thoughts at that moment. next day she took it out and put it into a large book as she usually did with papers which she wanted to be able to find easily. i cannot say either whether she showed the letter to her sisters. aglaya took the note and read it. this was more than colia could bear. ii. it was the beginning of june and for a whole week the weather in st. petersburg had been magnificent. petersburg. and to this spot mrs. epanchin determined to proceed without further delay. in a couple of days all was ready and the family had left town. no one met him but as he stepped out of the carriage he suddenly became aware of two strangely glowing eyes fixed upon him from among the crowd that met the train. here he engaged a couple of rooms dark and badly furnished. he washed and changed and hurriedly left the hotel again as though anxious to waste no time. but what is there that people will not smile at the windows looking on the street were open and the sound of a voice reading aloud or making a speech came through them. the visitor asked if mr. lebedeff were at home. when the prince entered lebedeff was standing in the middle of the room his back to the door. heres someone to see you look here... a gentleman to speak to you... lebedeff started and at sight of the prince stood like a statue for a moment. she screamed and ran towards the kitchen. they were all laughing and the guest joined in the chorus. hes only had three or four small glasses perhaps five but what is that it is the best time. he went up to his daughter and looked at the child in her arms anxiously making the sign of the cross over her three times. he is getting ready. do be quiet you must be drunk and who do you think was his last client but he was much pleased with himself in spite of that. today we have heard it for the fifth time. he was just starting again when you arrived so much does he admire it. i think by the way that you are prince muishkin well will you judge between us i am his nephew he did speak the truth there although he is generally telling lies. i mean to do so and i shall for i have a determined character. i admit that my uncle has helped me once or twice before. i spoke most severely of my conduct as everyone here can witness. just look at my boots now i only beg for fifteen roubles and i give my word that i will never ask him for anything again. if he wants interest he shall have that too why should he be so mean now why are you smiling prince say plainly that you think that i am quite wrong without any somewhat thats good i must say if people dont learn by experience they never understand. they must be taught. my intentions are perfectly honest on my conscience he will lose nothing and i will pay back the money with interest. what does he want more look what he does himself how did he manage to buy this house you are smiling. fancy he is mad with suspicion and sees a thief in every corner. colia heard it too. how often did i sing him to sleep when i was half dead with hunger do you know who she was did you know this i see by your expression that you did not well how did she die she was so terrified that she did not understand what was happening. why are you laughing and your story was not even correct i said oh lord thats enough in all conscience pray for whom you choose and the devil take them and you he will be set up he puts his hand on his heart and he is delighted i never said he was a man without heart but he is a rascal thats the pity of it. he loves his children oh i know that well enough now do tell us why you must needs lie about it yesterday the general promised to come and lodge here but he did not appear. most probably he slept at the hotel close by. no doubt colia is there unless he has gone to pavlofsk to see the epanchins. he had a little money and was intending to go there yesterday. they went across the yard and found themselves in a delightful little garden with the trees already in their summer dress of green thanks to the unusually fine weather. in a few minutes the coffee appeared and the prince did not refuse it. yes you know why i came lebedeff. your letter brought me. speak the prince looked at him gravely. rogojin has been here these three weeks. have you managed to sell her to him as you did before it was a question of minutes when she slipped off to petersburg. i can find out for myself. only tell me where is she now at his house certainly not i am quite free she says. all right yet i am much mistaken if she does not look on him with fear and trembling. but it must be gone through. i can give you a proof of it. a few days ago she tried to pull my hair because i said something that annoyed her. who has the least respect for lebedeff such is the power of the mind and the spirit. then he begged me to close the book and sent me away promising to put my name on the reward list. the prince seemed to be considering the suggestion. the little one is delicate she needs change of air and during our absence this house will be done up. it is a pleasant place lying on a hill surrounded by trees and one can live there for a mere song. there is good music to be heard so no wonder it is popular. i shall stay in the lodge. now this was precisely what lebedeff had made up his mind to do in the last three minutes. muishkin stopped short. i should like to know when you are going to start. iii. it was now close on twelve oclock. there are a few of these old houses built towards the end of the last century still standing in that part of st. petersburg and showing little change from their original form and colour. rogojin and his mother and brother occupied the whole of the second floor. the servant who opened the door to muishkin led him without taking his name through several rooms and up and down many steps until they arrived at a door where he knocked. parfen rogojin opened the door himself. on seeing the prince he became deadly white and apparently fixed to the ground so that he was more like a marble statue than a human being. he stared with an expression almost of terror and his lips twisted into a bewildered smile. they were evidently on quite familiar terms. they had not met now however for three months. as he invited the prince to sit down near the table the latter happened to turn towards him and was startled by the strange expression on his face. a painful recollection flashed into his mind. he stood for a time looking straight at rogojin whose eyes seemed to blaze like fire. at last rogojin smiled though he still looked agitated and shaken. it seemed to the prince that he was trembling. he tried to give the prince an affectionate smile and it seemed to the latter as though in this smile of his something had broken and that he could not mend it try as he would. rogojin did not insist upon an answer and there was silence for a few moments. your house has the aspect of yourself and all your family it bears the stamp of the rogojin life but ask me why i think so and i can tell you nothing. it is nonsense of course. this was his study and is now mine. i repeat this to you now just as i said it to you once before on a very similar occasion. that first time she fled to me from you from the very altar almost and begged me to save her from you. afterwards she ran away from me again and you found her and arranged your marriage with her once more and now i hear she has run away from you and come to petersburg. is it true lebedeff wrote me to this effect and thats why i came here. both mind and body need a change badly. i did not intend to take her abroad myself. i was going to arrange for her to go without me. i have never concealed my own opinion from you. i have always told you that i consider a marriage between you and her would be ruin to her. if this marriage were to be broken off again i admit i should be greatly pleased but at the same time i have not the slightest intention of trying to part you. you may be quite easy in your mind and you need not suspect me. you know yourself whether i was ever really your rival or not even when she ran away and came to me. it is perfectly true that we lived apart from one another all the time in different towns. i told you before that i did not love her with love but with pity you said then that you understood me did you really understand me or not what hatred there is in your eyes at this moment i love you very much parfen and now i shall go away and never come back again. both were silent for a few moments. there you say you love her with pity. i have no pity for her. i dream of her every night and always that she is laughing at me with another man. and so she does laugh at me. she thinks no more of marrying me than if she were changing her shoe. why she ran away from me and went to you. my friend thats absurd. you dont know what a fool she made of me in moscow and the money i spent over her the money she says shes still her own mistress and may turn me off altogether and go abroad. she is always laughing at me for some reason or other but at other times shes angry and wont say a word and thats what im afraid of. sometimes when i can keep away no longer i steal past the house on the sly and once i watched at the gate till dawn i thought something was going on and she saw me from the window. she asked me what i should do if i found she had deceived me. however i caught hold of her one day and said you are engaged to be married into a respectable family and do you know what sort of a woman you are they are afraid of you and tried to frighten me too. you must be shown that once for all. you are playing off your pride against your stomach in the morning she came out. are you quite mad she said sharply. no i wont and i wont marry you. ive said it. surely you havent sat in this chair all night without sleeping i didnt sleep i said. hm how sensible of you. and are you going to have no breakfast or dinner today i told you i wouldnt. my word what a dreadful thing that you should sit here and eat no food how terribly frightened i am she wasnt angry long and didnt seem to remember my offence at all. and thats the truth. ive learned nothing at all i said. then ill lend it to you to read. all you have read out is perfectly true say i. then she got angry and went out. i suppose youd murder me before you drowned yourself though she cried as she left the room. and how can i do it better sit down theyll bring you some dinner directly. the prince rose again as if he would leave. have you given up loving her altogether at first you suffered badly i know it i saw it. out of pity eh i trust you but i cant understand. what seems to me the most extraordinary thing is that she can again consent to marry you after all that has passed between you. when i heard the news yesterday i could hardly bring myself to believe it. what can she want with you now your money nonsense besides i should think you must have made a fairly large hole in your fortune already. surely it is not because she is so very anxious to find a husband she could find many a one besides yourself. anyone would be better than you because you will murder her and i feel sure she must know that but too well by now. indeed that may be it. he was carefully observing every change in the expression of the princes face. she said exactly the same almost word for word when she saw my fathers portrait. she looked long at the portrait and asked all about my father. youd be just such another she said at last and laughed. the first time i ever heard anything of that sort from her. she never talked to me like that before. we went all over this old house together. she sits and bows from her chair to everyone she sees. if you left her alone and didnt feed her for three days i dont believe she would notice it. she saw this book here lying before me. what have you begun to read russian history she asked. thats good she said you go on like that reading books. and if you do so wish surely you may hope to i said just now that i considered it extraordinary that she could still be ready to marry you. well though i cannot yet understand it i feel sure she must have some good reason or she wouldnt do it. of course of course she does not think so ill of you as you say. it is impossible they do say that you are a you know what she loves another there you can understand that much just as i love her exactly so she loves another man. and that other man is do you know who its you. she has loved you ever since that day her birthday only she thinks she cannot marry you because it would be the ruin of you. everybody knows what sort of a woman i am she says. she told me all this herself to my very face she can marry me all right ha ha thats nothing either she says come on ill marry you theres nothing extraordinary about her having run away from you she ran away because she found out how dearly she loved you. she could not bear to be near you. you said just now that i had found her at moscow when she ran away from you. i didnt do anything of the sort she came to me herself straight from you. name the day im ready she said. she doesnt do it because i am perhaps even more dreadful to her than the water shall i tell you what you were thinking to yourself just then you were thinking how can she marry him after this perhaps you didnt come with the idea but the idea is certainly there now ha ha well thats enough what are you upset about didnt you really know it all before suddenly he burst out laughing. over the door however there was one of strange and rather striking shape it was six or seven feet in length and not more than a foot in height. the prince glanced at it but took no further notice. he moved on hastily as though anxious to get out of the house. but rogojin suddenly stopped underneath the picture. of course his strange frame of mind was sufficient to account for his conduct but still it seemed queer to the prince that he should so abruptly drop a conversation commenced by himself. rogojin did not take any notice of his question. they had now reached the front door. the prince stopped. muishkin looked surprised but went out. the other followed him as far as the landing of the outer stairs and shut the door behind him. the prince made one step forward and then turned round. one morning i met a man in the train and made acquaintance with him at once. he doesnt believe in god and he talked a good deal about it but all the while it appeared to me that he was speaking outside the subject. and it has always struck me both in speaking to such men and in reading their books that they do not seem really to be touching on that at all though on the surface they may appear to do so. i told him this but i dare say i did not clearly express what i meant for he could not understand me. they were not drunk but one of them had noticed for the first time that his friend possessed a silver watch which he was wearing on a chain. he laughed as though he were in a sort of fit. oh prince prince thats too good for anything you cant have invented it. he came up to me and said buy my silver cross sir at that time everything that i saw made a tremendous impression upon me. the mother was quite a girl herself. what is it my good woman i asked her. i was never but asking questions then this is my reply. but the principal thing and the conclusion of my argument is that this is most clearly seen in the heart of a russian. this is a conviction which i have gained while i have been in this russia of ours. yes parfen there is work to be done there is work to be done in this russian world remember what talks we used to have in moscow and i never wished to come here at all and i never thought to meet you like this parfen well well goodbye goodbye the prince reflected and then mounted the stairs once more. he pulled out the cross without taking it off his neck. parfen was silent. at moments at all events it showed itself but too plainly 
at last rogojin took the princes hand and stood so for some moments as though he could not make up his mind. an old woman opened to them and bowed low to parfen who asked her some questions hurriedly but did not wait to hear her answer. they both looked as though they never broke the silence. bless him mother as you would bless your own son. she then nodded her head kindly at him once more. but the latter had hardly raised his arms when he dropped them again. he could not make up his mind to it he turned away from the prince in order to avoid looking at him. its fate shes yours. he left a card and determined to look up colia who had a room at a small hotel near. in early summer there are often magnificent days in st.
petersburg bright hot and still. this happened to be such a day. for some time the prince wandered about without aim or object. he did not know the town well. he was tired of solitude now a new rush of feeling took hold of him and a flood of light chased away the gloom for a moment from his soul. ah this idea amused him and he laughed. he remembered clearly that just here standing before this window he had suddenly turned round just as earlier in the day he had turned and found the dreadful eyes of rogojin fixed upon him. of that he could judge when the attack was over. no argument was possible on that point. and this fact had occurred. it was about seven oclock and the place was empty. all the time he was trying to forget some thing to escape from some idea that haunted him but melancholy thoughts came back though he would so willingly have escaped from them. petersburg. he had not gone there however and he knew very well that it was of no use to go now for he would certainly not find lebedeffs relation at home. he had the address but she must certainly have gone to pavlofsk or colia would have let him know. if he were to go now it would merely be out of curiosity but a sudden new idea had come into his head. however it was something to move on and know where he was going. a minute later he was still moving on but without knowing anything. he could no longer think out his new idea. he spoke to some children he met. the evening was very close thunder was heard some way off. since he came to russia he had heard many stories of this kind and was interested in them. but every soul is a mystery and depths of mystery lie in the soul of a russian. did he kill those six persons it is curious that i had forgotten her until now. could he really say what they were after one short visit did he expect to find him so he had never seen him like that before. good heavens can it be that rogojin wishes to murder anyone the prince began to tremble violently. why here he was on the petersburg side already quite close to the house but just now all the gloom and darkness had fled his heart felt full of joy and hope there was no such thing as doubt. and yes he hadnt seen her for so long he really must see her. he wished he could meet rogojin he would take his hand and they would go to her together. his heart was pure he was no rival of parfens. tomorrow he would go and tell him that he had seen her. why he had only come for the sole purpose of seeing her all the way from moscow perhaps she might be here still who knows she might not have gone away to pavlofsk yet. it must all be clear as day. cannot rogojins soul bear the light rogojin reading a book wasnt that sympathy beginning and his story of waiting day and night for her forgiveness that didnt look quite like passion alone. he had almost fallen into despair. how could he have lost his hold upon her when she ran away from him to rogojin he ought to have run after her himself rather than wait for news as he had done. can rogojin have failed to observe up to now that she is mad what was it he had hinted at in that suggestion of his the prince suddenly blushed and shuddered to his very heart. but why recall all this yes. he will become her slave her brother her friend. compassion will teach even rogojin it will show him how to reason. compassion is the chief law of human existence. oh how guilty he felt towards rogojin it would all come right he said he liked to look at that picture it was not that he liked it but he felt the need of looking at it. he must have something to hold on to and believe and someone to believe in. why this is the street and heres the house no. but he went away not as he came. a great change had suddenly come over him. his demon was upon him once more. what had happened to him was it because he had just seen these dreadful eyes again just as though he had not expected to see them yes they were the very same eyes and no doubt about it. and why had not the prince approached him and spoken to him instead of turning away and pretending he had seen nothing although their eyes met yes their eyes had met and they had looked at each other. yes he was convinced of it convinced of what my god what a day but here he was back at his hotel. how he had dreaded coming back to it for some reason. it concerned the knife on rogojins table. the man moved on up the stairs a moment later the prince passed up them too. as is often the case in petersburg houses it was narrow and very dark and turned around a massive stone column. he thought he could distinguish a figure standing there. he would pass by quickly and not look. the eyes the same two eyes met his for one second they stood face to face. suddenly the prince caught the man by the shoulder and twisted him round towards the light so that he might see his face more clearly. the prince did not think of trying to stop it. very soon in five minutes or so he was discovered and a crowd collected around him. a pool of blood on the steps near his head gave rise to grave fears. was it a case of accident or had there been a crime three days later they were all at pavlofsk. according to lebedeff these trees gave the house a most delightful aspect. some were there when he bought it and he was so charmed with the effect that he promptly added to their number. on the day that they left for pavlofsk that is the day after his attack he appeared almost well though in reality he felt very far from it. the faces of those around him for the last three days had made a pleasant impression. he was also glad to receive a visit from general ivolgin before leaving st.
petersburg. gania was the first to arrive. he had grown so pale and thin that the prince could hardly recognize him. he seemed as if he could not do without the general. he would listen at the door for half an hour at a time while the two were talking. colia found this out and naturally told the prince of his discovery. the prince looked him sternly up and down. i would not let him in there is no need for him to visit you prince... i have the deepest esteem for him he is a a great man. you dont believe it well and good but he sticks at nothing he immediately makes himself one of the family. if you are his nephew it follows that i must also be a relation of yours most excellent prince. i am quite sincere. you said just now that i always looked as if i was going to tell you a secret you are right. are they here at that moment colia appeared on the terrace he announced that lizabetha prokofievna and her three daughters were close behind him. moved by this news lebedeff hurried up to the prince. let in anyone who wants to see me. seeing him laugh lebedeff thought fit to laugh also and though much agitated his satisfaction was quite visible. colia was right the epanchin ladies were only a few steps behind him. the general brought the princes card down from town and mrs. epanchin had felt convinced that he himself would follow his card at once she was much excited. in the evening however colia came with the story of the princes adventures so far as he knew them. in fact she had never had the slightest intention of doing otherwise. prince s. who was in the house was requested to escort the ladies. he had been much interested when he first heard of the prince from the epanchins. prince s. had greatly taken to him and was delighted with the opportunity of meeting him again. the general had not come down from town as yet nor had evgenie pavlovitch arrived. it was not more than two or three hundred yards from the epanchins
house to lebedeffs. lebedeff ptitsin and general ivolgin hastened to find chairs for the young ladies. i am always wiser on second thoughts and i dare say you are the same. i assure you i am as glad to see you well as though you were my own son yes and more and if you dont believe me the more shame to you and its not my fault. these things do happen you know now then why didnt you come to us we have a wing quite empty. but just as you like of course. he no sooner caught sight of his daughter than he rushed in her direction waving his arms to keep her away he even forgot himself so far as to stamp his foot. she looks very sweet. you are nothing more than a fool if youll excuse me well well lebedeff bowed low. it may even be original. she could not bear this general ivolgin whom she had once known long ago in society. i was six years old i remember. he made me a bow and arrow and i shot a pigeon. but it happened that this time he had really hit upon the truth though he had himself entirely forgotten the fact. you were such a lovely little thing nina alexandrovna gania listen go go im serious by this time some of the visitors had disappeared. he was certainly much changed as anyone could see who had not met him for some time and this fact seemed to afford aglaya a good deal of satisfaction. whats better in him where did you get that idea from aglaya ivanovna asked you to draw his portrait and gave you the whole subject of the picture. we then began to think over all our friends faces to see if any of them would do and none suited us and so the matter stood thats all. that sort of thing is not to be found every day among the men of our times. at all events you are not to talk like that again. i have hated poetry all my life. prince you must excuse this nonsense. we neither of us like this sort of thing the prince tried to say something but he was too confused and could not get his words out. she seemed in fact quite pleased. she now rose solemnly from her seat walked to the centre of the terrace and stood in front of the princes chair. it was clear to him that she was doing all this with some special object. he then got behind his chair and stood there with his left hand resting on the back of it. the prince was much interested in the young man who had just entered. he was puzzled however by the young mans plain clothes for he had always heard of evgenie pavlovitch as a military man. but it had become quite a different matter with aglaya. they had evidently talked and laughed over the poor knight for more than a month. the thing made an uncomfortable impression upon the prince. do you understand now come along young woman weve sat here too long. his change of dress was evidently a matter of some importance. aglaya alone was not interested. i could hardly believe my eyes when i met him in petersburg just now. why this haste thats what i want to know. he had however always made more or less of a joke about it so no one had taken him seriously. ask evgenie pavlovitch if i am not right. this pleased muishkin. at this moment vera came up to lizabetha prokofievna carrying several large and beautifully bound books apparently quite new. if you will sell it very good and thank you. but for goodness sake dont twist about like that sir i have heard of you they tell me you are a very learned person. we must have a talk one of these days. i do not intend to receive you today. you may send your daughter vera at once if you like. it would be better to receive them and then you will get rid of them. deal with them promptly prince and dont spare them i am sick of hearing about the affair and many a quarrel i have had in your cause. but i confess i am anxious to see what happens so do make them come out here and we will remain. they go straight to the point. no but if they have a great desire for anything they believe they have a right to get it even at the cost of the lives say of eight persons. dont believe him lizabetha prokofievna. however i do not care about receiving them here in public. excuse me lizabetha prokofievna. they are coming and you can see them and then i will take them away. the prince begged the visitors to sit down. they were all so young that it made the proceedings seem even more extraordinary. evidently he had joined the others as a comrade to give them moral and if necessary material support. and you... you may be a general the latter was so astonished that he did not reply but looked steadily at him in return. lizabetha prokofievna had had time to read some of it and was greatly upset. progress  there is no end to this gentlemen so let us come to the point. can you understand such an expression gentlemen whom he chose himself in paris. it would seem that fortune had turned her back upon our hero. could anyone possibly imagine a better match one fine morning a man called upon him calm and severe of aspect distinguished but plainly dressed. finding that a child was expected he hastened her marriage with a man of noble character who had loved her for a long time. according to justice all that was done for me ought to have been done for him. you can hardly believe it gentlemen but that is what he did the girls were uncomfortable and ashamed. ptitsin varia gania and lebedeff himself all looked rather confused. it was evident that he was delighted with the article. i say nothing about the article gentlemen except that every word is false i say this because you know it as well as i do. did you write all that yourself do you believe that in this affair of burdovsky you have right on your side yes or no if you refuse to satisfy us that is if your answer is no we will go away at once and there will be an end of the matter. i have no more to say i have put the question before you. now turn us out if you dare. you can do it force is on your side. but let us put that aside and return to the point. what but i wrote and published it in the form of a letter in the paper of a friend. i showed it to no one but burdovsky and i did not read it all through even to him. but what did you know of my intentions it may be that i have resolved to satisfy mr. burdovskys claim. oh i will go on only please do not take offence without good cause. i dont know how you cannot see that gentlemen besides i had no intention of leaving the matter there. but gentlemen why are you getting angry again are we never to come to an understanding well the event has proved me right i see what he is for myself. he is an innocent man deceived by everyone i had not heard from him for some time as i was away and have been ill for three days since my return to st. petersburg. i know gentlemen that many people think me an idiot. but the main point is listen gentlemen let me finish the main point is that mr.
burdovsky is not pavlicheffs son at all. well what do you think of that what he is not pavlicheffs son but i feel certain that he does not understand it i understand that. i am all the better able to pity mr. burdovsky because i know from experience what it is to be like that and so i have a right to speak. listen gentlemen this matter must be settled keep calm do not get angry and sit down gavrila ardalionovitch will explain everything to you at once and i confess that i am very anxious to hear all the details myself. till then gavrila ardalionovitch had sat apart in silence. all conversation ceased instantly. everyone especially the burdovsky party listened with the utmost curiosity. certainly he could not have read that passage. he gave me two more letters written by the latter when he was still in foreign parts. your mother as you are well aware has never been out of russia.... it is too late to read the letters now i am content to state the fact. burdovsky got up abruptly. i believe you. i give it up.... but i refuse the ten thousand roubles. some rather curious and important facts have come to light and it is absolutely necessary in my opinion that you should hear them. his friend lebedeffs nephew who had risen to accompany him also sat down again. indeed he passed the greater part of his life out of russia returning at intervals for short visits. as the event has proved it was not impossible to find evidence of his absence though i must confess that chance has helped me in a quest which might very well have come to nothing. pardon me. it is an insult the affair is quite painful enough for him without that. enough in my opinion this is most important. burdovsky alone sat silent and motionless. hush how dare you... and now i am again to blame. she says so herself... i did not know... gavrila ardalionovitch did not tell me that... forgive me i dared to offer you ten thousand roubles but i was wrong. he stood waiting for his wife with an air of offended dignity. lebedeffs nephew took up the word again. we have nothing to hide our actions can bear daylight. burdovsky has refused ten thousand roubles you heard him. burdovsky is poor he has no millions. those who knew lizabetha prokofievna saw at once how it was with her. you had not sense enough to take me away before. you are my husband you are a father it was your duty to drag me away by force if in my folly i refused to obey you and go quietly. you might at least have thought of your daughters. we can find our way out now without your help. here is shame enough for a year wait a moment till i thank the prince thank you prince for the entertainment you have given us is it possible that there can be many such people on earth be quiet aglaya be quiet alexandra it is none of your business you will wont you you will no my dear sir you may take other people in mrs. epanchins language astonished everybody. i had not heard of it before. now i understand everything. the woman question give us our rights but dont dare to speak in our presence. but good heavens they are mad vain fools is not this absurd are there many people like you what are you smiling at because i am not ashamed to disgrace myself before you lizabetha prokofievna mrs. epanchin had approached hippolyte and seized him firmly by the arm while her eyes blazing with fury were fixed upon his face. i am ready to explain why i was laughing. it is ridiculous you should take care of yourself what is the use of holding a conversation now so in a way this is my farewell to nature and to men. just now you would not stop shouting and now you can hardly breathe. why will you not grant my last wish do you know lizabetha prokofievna that i have dreamed of meeting you for a long while i had often heard of you from colia he is almost the only person who still comes to see me. i think i am not mistaken that is your daughter aglaya ivanovna she is so beautiful that i recognized her directly although i had never seen her before. i am exhausted. do you know what you might do lizabetha prokofievna i think you wanted to take the prince home with you for tea. stay here and let us spend the evening together. i am sure the prince will give us all some tea. forgive me for being so free and easy but i know you are kind and the prince is kind too. lebedeff hurried out followed by vera. you have made me sorry for you. nobody it is absurd however forgive me prince if i blew you up that is if you like of course. the general murmured a few polite words and asked lizabetha prokofievna if she did not feel cold on the terrace. evgenie pavlovitch and prince s. suddenly grew extremely gay and amiable. aglaya alone still frowned and sat apart in silence. the prince took care to offer tea to burdovsky and his friends as well as the rest. the invitation made them rather uncomfortable. tea was served at once lebedeff had no doubt ordered it for himself and his family before the others arrived. it was striking eleven. he seemed confused and almost at a loss. yet he has brought them out tonight in your honour of course i am very anxious that she should get it without delay and i shall stay till she does. he had just heard hippolyte mention his own name. he thinks he has only to say i am base and there is an end of it. as to you prince are you not ashamed keller suddenly left his seat and approached lizabetha prokofievna. i knew the effect it would have on you on you alone for the prince will forgive him. i know i express myself badly. this was all that she had called her for. and he himself is the cause of her disgrace. is not that true is it not true i have suspected for a long time that you cared for nothing else well let me tell you that perhaps there is not one of you who loved your mother as burdovsky loved his. as to you prince i know that you have sent money secretly to burdovskys mother through gania. yes that is quite certain that is all now you have no more to say her anxious eyes had never left the invalid. thank you prince. i heard it just now but had forgotten it. indeed the world has often come to that conclusion. hippolyte rose all at once looking troubled and almost frightened. lizabetha prokofievna approached him anxiously and seized his arm. he stared at her for a moment still laughing but soon his face grew serious. then he seemed to be plunged in thought. a moment later he raised his head and his eyes sought for someone. but i am not eighteen you know lying on that bed and looking out of that window i have thought of all sorts of things for such a long time that... a dead man has no age you know. i was saying that to myself only last week when i was awake in the night. do you know what you fear most the idea crossed my mind that night... you thought i was making fun of you just now lizabetha prokofievna this is the last time i shall see the trees too. tell them about it try to tell them i thought. here is a beautiful young girl you are a dead man make them understand that. at the sight of it hippolyte seemed amazed. but i must leave him too i wanted to leave them all there was not one of them not one i wanted to be a man of action i had a right to be. oh what a lot of things i wanted oh it is better for me to die i wanted to live for the happiness of all men to find and spread the truth. and what is the result nothing therefore i must be a fool i am useless it is time i disappeared and i shall leave not even a memory not a sound not a trace not a single deed i have not spread a single truth... do not laugh at the fool forget him forget him forever there you must not cry that will do. you are a good child god will forgive you because you knew no better. come now be a man you are a saint you are a child yourself save them oh help them i tell you if you cannot come to some decision i will stay here all night myself. if you dont want him i will take him back to my house why good gracious he can hardly stand up himself what is it moreover a new trouble almost a fear showed itself in his eyes he watched hippolyte anxiously as if expecting something further. suddenly hippolyte arose. he had decided to go with them. that is what you feared i saw through you and hated you long ago from the day i first heard of you. i hated you with my whole heart. you have contrived all this you have driven me into this state you have made a dying man disgrace himself. i would kill you if i remained alive not from any one i want nothing ah what a wonderful man the prince is then she turned to the prince. the general thought fit to put in a word after his wife. however there was no one left to turn out of the house for they had managed meanwhile to get hippolyte into the cab and it had driven off. what do you think evgenie pavlovitch did the same and he alone seemed in good spirits. aglaya left without saying goodbye. but the evening was not to end without a last adventure. an unexpected meeting was yet in store for lizabetha prokofievna. having passed some ten yards beyond the house the carriage suddenly drew up and one of the two ladies seated in it turned sharp round as though she had just caught sight of some acquaintance whom she particularly wished to see. ive sent to town for you twice today myself i persuaded him to other things also troubled and perplexed him and one of these grew more important in his eyes as the days went by. it is ridiculous. besides he cannot possibly be on such intimate terms with nastasia philipovna as she gave us to understand thats the principal part of the mystery he has given me his word that he knows nothing whatever about the matter and of course i believe him. well the question is my dear prince do you know anything about it i assure you i hardly know you for your old self. how can you suppose that i ever suggested you could have had a finger in such a business the latter however remained silent. he may have known her some time ago two or three years at least. he used to know totski. she has not even been in the place many people dont even know that she has returned from moscow but the visit was of the greatest importance to the prince from his own point of view. and if all this were so then she must have some terrible object in view what was it there was no stopping her as muishkin knew from experience in the performance of anything she had set her mind on then came her younger sister and later the brother who attended a school close by. vera related how keller had taken up his abode with them on the previous evening. she thought he would remain for some time as he was greatly pleased with the society of general ivolgin and of the whole family. but he declared that he had only come to them in order to complete his education the prince always enjoyed the company of lebedeffs children and today it was especially welcome for colia did not appear all day. early that morning he had started for petersburg. lebedeff also was away on business. but gavrila ardalionovitch had promised to visit muishkin who eagerly awaited his coming. about seven in the evening soon after dinner he arrived. at the first glance it struck the prince that he at any rate must know all the details of last nights affair. it was apparent now when he entered that he was convinced that the moment for breaking the ice between them had come at last. among other things gania told his host that nastasia philipovna had been only four days in pavlofsk and that everyone was talking about her already. a crowd of followers had pursued her from the first young and old. she dressed quietly though with such taste as to drive all the ladies in pavlofsk mad with envy of that as well as of her beauty and her carriage and horses. but the prince did not inquire. muishkin was glad enough to be left alone. he went out of the garden crossed the road and entered the park. the fact is he felt a longing to leave all this and go away go anywhere if only it were far enough and at once without bidding farewell to anyone. at that moment he was thoroughly unhappy. he announced that he had come to tell the story of his life to muishkin and had only remained at pavlofsk for that purpose. when i die that secret will die with me where to find it is the question. can you picture that to yourself yes well thats all right said i. oh prince asked the prince of himself for he began to feel a kind of pity for his visitor. it never appears in practice or deed. now why is that well to begin with it is good to meet a man like you. it is a pleasure to talk over my faults with you. now do explain it to me prince because i... i really do not understand... this was my thought as i was sobbing myself to sleep at dawn. just as i was losing consciousness tears in my soul tears on my face i remember how i lay there sobbing an idea from hell struck me. i can assure you keller i reproach myself bitterly for it sometimes. when you were talking just now i seemed to be listening to something about myself. i have tried and i know. god knows whence they arise these ideas that you speak of as base. as for the money you want it for drink do you not it is impossible. what can we do it is best i think to leave the matter to your own conscience. to show how grateful i am and as a punishment i will not accept a hundred and fifty roubles. give me twentyfive that will be enough it is all i really need for a fortnight at least. i will not ask you for more for a fortnight. because you see through a man somehow. i assure you this is the truth prince i would not tell any other man for the world have you anything to say to me i am speaking the truth i am indeed tell me for heavens sake evidently he was struggling to decide. all that has been invented by you or fools like you he had gone straight to the epanchins
from the station. not a word about you prince the whole time colia did not know any details except that it had been a terrible quarrel and another curious thing
mrs. epanchin was so angry that she called varia to her varia was talking to the girls and turned her out of the house once for all she said. oh no there he was delighted that the prince should be jealous about aglaya. however he stopped immediately on seeing that the other was really hurt and the conversation continued very earnestly for an hour or more. next day the prince had to go to town on business. returning in the afternoon he happened upon general epanchin at the station. he was burning to speak about something of importance. i would have come to see you yesterday but i didnt know how lizabetha prokofievna would take it. as for you i feel sure you are the least to blame of any of us though you certainly have been the cause of a good deal of trouble. why im sure i cant tell you. what a carriage that was and where did it come from eh is it to keep evgenie to herself i told my wife so. i blush at the very idea. and now she turns up again like this when i thought she had finally disappeared wheres rogojin all this time but for all this im uncomfortable i dont know why. it was seven in the evening and the prince was just preparing to go out for a walk in the park when suddenly mrs. epanchin appeared on the terrace. nonsense what was your object what was the letter about at last he spoke. all right my dear it is a joke. you dont suppose she could take any interest in you do you i used to be just such another. i dont believe it and it is not to be. are you in love with her you may kiss me i breathe freely at last. but you must know my dear friend aglaya does not love you and she shall never be your wife while i am out of my grave. so be warned in time. i have my own grief always the same always the same. now then tell me yes or no i have my own ideas about it. but why he was made such a fool of i cannot understand. however he is not going to marry aglaya i can tell you that. he may be a very excellent fellow but so it shall be. she was anxious to see what impression the news as to evgenie pavlovitch had made upon him. oh you simpleton you simpleton so i should have supposed. good lord was there ever such a man as you its impossible shes wicked wicked ill repeat it for a thousand years that shes wicked they all are just now all my daughters even that wet hen alexandra. and yet i dont believe it. because i dont choose to believe it perhaps but i dont. but what may be so to other mens eyes is not so to yours. i am convinced that you are better than other people. pleased with all that nonsense why conceal your real feelings i shall forget your very name the prince hesitated. he perceived that he had said too much now. whom was it that boy was it a message the next minute she flew at the prince seized his hand and dragged him after her to the door. come on i shall see now with my own eyes. he couldnt even choose a respectable shape for his hat come on else she would never have sent you that silly note. hm thats why she is anxious for you to come to the house. you deserve it and she can do it oh she can indeed they were not quite certain but had at times a strong suspicion that things did not happen to them as they did to other people. oh no. the fact is it is all of a piece with these modern ideas that wretched womans question six months ago aglaya took a fancy to cut off her magnificent hair. why even i when i was young had nothing like it what more do they want why dont they get married prince s. was a distinguished man he had money and his future wife was devoted to him what more could be desired with regard to her eldest daughter alexandra the mother never quite knew whether there was cause for anxiety or not. sometimes she felt as if there was nothing to be expected from her. oh she is as stupid as a fool he knew it well and for his part held her in the greatest esteem. but the mothers great and continual anxiety was aglaya. a real little demon what had really happened if it had been any other family than the epanchins nothing particular would have happened. its all your fault. i dare say it was that varia who sent the letter. that woman is doing it all for him i know she is to show she can make a fool of him now just as she did when he used to give her pearls. you must be pleased to remember they heard it all. i cannot forgive that wretched prince. i never shall forgive him what has gavrila ardalionovitch to do with it i do believe ive gone mad at last. what on earth have i done now to talk to a young man about my daughters secrets and secrets having to do with himself too thank goodness hes an idiot and a friend of the house what an idea look at her now. why doesnt she make fun of him she said she would and she doesnt. look there nobody else can get a word in. the latter had never appeared so happy and excited as on this evening. the prince listened to him but for a long time did not take in a word he said. prince s. was there and they all intended to go out to hear the band very soon. colia arrived presently and joined the circle. if you are serious that is. for since it has been the part of these three men and only these three to say something absolutely their own not borrowed so by this very fact these three men become really national. if any russian shall have done or said anything really and absolutely original he is to be called national from that moment though he may not be able to talk the russian language still he is a national russian. why do you laugh you are laughing again and you prince are smiling too. these were his first words since he had entered the house he tried to lift his eyes and look around but dared not evgenie pavlovitch noticed his confusion and smiled. is this so yes. very well. everybody laughed. but to prove that this time i was speaking absolutely seriously and especially to prove this to the prince for you prince have interested me exceedingly and i swear to you that i am not quite such an ass as i like to appear sometimes although i am rather an ass i admit and well ladies and gentlemen will you allow me to put just one more question to the prince out of pure curiosity it shall be the last. how pleased you were with the state of things as we found it and how glad i was to observe your delight and they were all like this. i consider there is the greatest difference between the two cases. alexandra who had seemed to wish to put in her word when the prince began now sat silent as though some sudden thought had caused her to change her mind about speaking. oh no there you did go up to town you know you did you said so yourself why so heaven is a difficult thing to find anywhere prince far more difficult than appears to that good heart of yours. the rest of the company followed her example. ii. the prince suddenly approached evgenie pavlovitch. what is it dont i am not going to have a fit. im going away directly i really am dont be afraid. but i see that i am out of place in society society is better without me. its not vanity i assure you. there are certain things certain great ideas which i must not so much as approach as prince s. has just reminded me or i shall make you all laugh. i will not marry you never and under no circumstances know that once and for all as if anyone could marry an absurd creature like you just look in the glass and see what you look like this very moment who could have said such a thing to her i assure you i am not guilty aglaya ivanovna i am not indeed. i never did wish to i never thought of it at all and never shall youll see it yourself you may be quite assured of it. isnt he a dear aglaya isnt he mother i must really give him a kiss for for his explanation to aglaya just now. may he mother you said you would never have me didnt you prince no no not like that thats not the way to give your arm. dont you know how to give your arm to a lady yet there so. now come along you and i will lead the way. evgenie pavlovitch seemed to be in a lively humour. the sisters who also appeared to be in high spirits never tired of glancing at aglaya and the prince who were walking in front. on this particular evening the weather was lovely and there were a large number of people present. evgenie pavlovitch too found plenty of friends to bow to. several people noticed aglaya and the prince who were still together. before very long two or three young men had come up and one or two remained to talk all of these young men appeared to be on intimate terms with evgenie pavlovitch. he tried to get up a conversation with aglaya and did his best to secure her attention. evgenie pavlovitch begged the princes leave to introduce their friend to him. only evgenie pavlovitch observed that aglaya flushed up for a moment at this. the prince did not notice that others were talking and making themselves agreeable to aglaya in fact at moments he almost forgot that he was sitting by her himself. at other moments he felt a longing to go away somewhere and be alone with his thoughts and to feel that no one knew where he was. or if that were impossible he would like to be alone at home on the terrace without either lebedeff or his children or anyone else about him and to lie there and think a day and night and another day again oh how he longed to be there now alone with his thoughts to think of one thing all his life one thing a thousand years would not be too much time and let everyone here forget him forget him utterly how much better it would have been if they had never known him if all this could but prove to be a dream. perhaps it was a dream now and then he looked at aglaya for five minutes at a time without taking his eyes off her face but his expression was very strange he would gaze at her as though she were an object a couple of miles distant or as though he were looking at her portrait and not at herself at all. you look as though you were just going to put out your hand and touch my face to see if its real but observing that she and the others had begun to laugh he too opened his mouth and laughed with them. the laughter became general and the young officer who seemed a particularly lively sort of person simply shook with mirth. how she frightened us just now didnt she very likely he had imagined it there only remained to him the impression of a strange smile two eyes and a bright green tie. true enough he had not remarked where he was coming to when he set out with aglaya he had not been in a condition to remark anything at all. had he been more careful to observe his companion he would have seen that for the last quarter of an hour aglaya had also been glancing around in apparent anxiety as though she expected to see someone or something particular among the crowd of people. the reason for their anxiety soon became apparent. it was to be supposed that some of them were more than half drunk although they were well enough dressed some even particularly well. she laughed and talked loudly however just as before. the prince had not seen her for more than three months. he could not picture to himself what impression this meeting with her would make upon him though he had often tried to imagine it with fear and trembling. one fact was quite certain and that was that the meeting would be painful. several times during the last six months he had recalled the effect which the first sight of this face had had upon him when he only saw its portrait. the sight of the portrait face alone had filled his heart full of the agony of real sympathy and this feeling of sympathy nay of actual suffering for her had never left his heart since that hour and was still in full force. oh yes and more powerful than ever but the prince was not satisfied with what he had said to rogojin. and indeed there were no words in which he could have expressed his horror yes horror for he was now fully convinced from his own private knowledge of her that the woman was mad. nastasia philipovna was at this moment passing the young ladies chairs. nastasia philipovna who up to now had been walking along as though she had not noticed the epanchin party suddenly turned her head in their direction as though she had just observed evgenie pavlovitch sitting there for the first time. dont you know about it yet he doesnt know imagine that why hes shot himself. your uncle shot himself this very morning. i was told at two this afternoon. half the town must know it by now. they say there are three hundred and fifty thousand roubles government money missing some say five hundred thousand. and i was under the impression that he would leave you a fortune hes whistled it all away. surely you intend to be off there dont you ha ha youve retired from the army in good time i see plain clothes nonsense nastasia turned to him. all this occurred of course in one instant of time. the young officer forgetting himself sprang towards her. in another moment of course the police would have been on the spot and it would have gone hard with nastasia philipovna had not unexpected aid appeared. muishkin who was but a couple of steps away had time to spring forward and seize the officers arms from behind. he appeared to be terribly excited he was trembling all over and was as pale as a corpse. look what the fellow got look at the blood on his cheek the prince walked away after the epanchin party. prince s. ran up to her and persuaded her at last to come home with them. in their excitement lizabetha prokofievna and the girls were nearly running all the way home. besides they could not help thinking that their sister aglaya probably knew more about the whole matter than both they and their mother put together. mrs.
epanchin did not say a word to him all the way home and he did not seem to observe the fact. his first word was to inquire after evgenie pavlovitch. he settled himself in a corner and sat waiting though he knew not what he expected. he seemed to have forgotten all the world and to be ready to sit on where he was for years on end. from upstairs he caught sounds of excited conversation every now and then. he could not say how long he sat there. it grew late and became quite dark. she seemed to be quite calm though a little pale. she looked suddenly but attentively into his face then at the window as though thinking of something else and then again at him. how can you not know i dont think so. now tell me they generally shoot at twenty paces dont they at ten sometimes so you see they dont aim at the chest or head they aim lower on purpose. you must buy one. french or english are the best they say. better put plenty. what are you laughing at aglaya stamped her foot with annoyance. her serious air however during this conversation had surprised him considerably. he had a feeling that he ought to be asking her something that there was something he wanted to find out far more important than how to load a pistol but his thoughts had all scattered and he was only aware that she was sitting by him and talking to him and that he was looking at her as to what she happened to be saying to him that did not matter in the least. it appeared that he and the general were going in the same direction. why when by whom if i have heard nothing about it nor have you nor he nor she who has heard about it i should like to know but now i see that their opinion is more correct. look at me im still trembling all over with the dreadful shock it is that that kept me in town so late. ha ha ha all petersburg if not all pavlofsk knows it by now. i mean her remark that he had retired just in time no no its dreadful horrible mind i dont suspect evgenie of anything be quite clear on that point but the thing is a little suspicious nevertheless. prince s. cant get over it. he has behaved very well indeed. i didnt mean to drop any sort of hint. do you know anything about it i wont stand it we have just had a terrible scene mind i speak to you as i would to my own son i dare swear she has had a good laugh at you before now you were having a quiet talk just now i observed after all the thunder and lightning upstairs. we all stood there with our mouths open. well i was told afterwards of your little passage with aglaya this afternoon and and dear prince you are a good sensible fellow dont be angry if i speak out she is laughing at you my boy she is enjoying herself like a child at your expense and therefore since she is a child dont be angry with her and dont think anything of it. i assure you she is simply making a fool of you just as she does with one and all of us out of pure lack of something better to do. well goodbye you know our feelings dont you our sincere feelings for yourself he read the note in the uncertain rays that fell from the window. i trust that you will not show this note to anyone. though i am ashamed of giving you such instructions i feel that i must do so considering what you are. i therefore write the words and blush for your simple character. it is the same green bench that i showed you before. there i waited for you at the epanchins
house but of course i could not come in. well prince here is keller absolutely at your service command him i know him or rather of him he wont pass an insult. he will take no notice of rogojin and myself and therefore you are the only one left to account for. he has been asking about you and undoubtedly his friend will call on you tomorrow perhaps he is at your house already. if you would do me the honour to have me for a second prince i should be happy. i shall beg his pardon thats all. but if we must fight well fight let him have a shot at me by all means i should rather like it. ha ha ha i know how to load a pistol now do you know how to load a pistol keller ha ha ha isnt that a grand reason keller my friend eh ha ha how was it you so suddenly popped up in front of me as you did well all get drunk lebedeff sold them to me the day after i arrived. i took the lot. well invite everybody he had never before seen the prince in such a strange condition of mind and could not have imagined the possibility of it. hm twelve bottles dear me thats a very respectable little stock indeed hum hes a nice fellow is this prince i like this sort of man. and yet she had this little note in her hand therefore she must have known that i was sitting there. so why was she surprised in moments of great joy he invariably felt a sensation of melancholy come over him he could not tell why. he looked intently around him and wondered why he had come here he was very tired so he approached the bench and sat down on it. all this would have been perfectly sincere on his part. it appeared to him that it was simply a joke on aglayas part if there really were anything in it at all but that seemed to him quite natural. as to the few words which the general had let slip about aglaya laughing at everybody and at himself most of all he entirely believed them. he did not feel the slightest sensation of offence on the contrary he was quite certain that it was as it should be. he wanted nothing more. the question as to what she might have to say of special interest to himself occurred to him once or twice. he did not doubt for a moment that she really had some such subject of conversation in store but so very little interested in the matter was he that it did not strike him to wonder what it could be. a man whose face it was difficult to see in the gloom approached the bench and sat down beside him. it was the first time they had met since the encounter on the staircase at the hotel. rogojin evidently saw and understood the impression he had made and though he seemed more or less confused at first yet he began talking with what looked like assumed ease and freedom. the man could not change his heart. rogojin smiled but did not explain. its no use you know. ive come to you from her she bade me tell you that she must see you she has something to say to you. ive given you the message. i felt you were still angry with me though. do you know why because you tried to kill me thats why you cant shake off your wrath against me. i wrote you this in yesterdays letter in order that you might forget all that madness on your part and that you might not feel called to talk about it when we met. why do you avoid me why do you hold your hand back from me i can understand all you did and all you felt that day as if it were myself. he had moved a pace or two away and was hiding his hands behind him. of course i believe every word you say and i know perfectly well that you neither did or ever can deceive me in any way and yet i dont love you. if you hadnt been in that condition of mind that you could think of nothing but one subject you would probably never have raised your knife against me. do you know yourself what you looked like what did you take me to your mother for did you think to stay your hand by doing so you probably couldnt if you were to try you dislike me too much for that. ill tell you. what if she loves you now better than anyone she wont tell you this of course you must have eyes to see. she must have a reason and that reason she will tell you some day. some women desire the kind of love you give her and she is probably one of these. rogojin continued to laugh loudly. he had listened to the princes speech with curiosity and some satisfaction. it wasnt like yourself prince. i saw you at the music you know and whom you were sitting with. but thats all the same to me prince and its not my affair at all for if you have ceased to love her she has not ceased to love you. you know of course that she wants to marry you to that girl ha ha she says to me until then i wont marry you. i dont know and i never did. at all events she named the day this evening as we left the gardens. what you say about me parfen never can and never will be. how can she write letters to her if shes mad havent you heard wait a bit and listen
as i have sat here and talked and listened it has suddenly struck me that tomorrow is my birthday. it must be about twelve oclock now come home with me do and well see the day in well have some wine and you shall wish me i dont know what but you especially you must wish me a good wish and i shall wish you full happiness in return. otherwise hand me my cross back again. you didnt return it to me next day. i dont wish to meet my new year without you my new life i should say for a new life is beginning for me. the prince could not believe his eyes when he beheld the latter and could not help thinking that something was wrong. lebedeff ran up promptly to explain the arrival of all these gentlemen. there lebedeff had joined him and his household had followed that is his daughters and general ivolgin. burdovsky had brought hippolyte and stayed on with him. evgenie pavlovitch had only dropped in half an hour or so ago. come and sit down prince we are all waiting for you we want you with us. come along prince and settle the question. he held out his hand to her. in the next room her younger sister lay on a wooden chest sound asleep with her mouth wide open but the boy lebedeffs son had taken up his position close beside colia and hippolyte his face lit up with interest in the conversation of his father and the rest to which he would willingly have listened for ten hours at a stretch. the prince approached evgenie pavlovitch last of all. the latter immediately took his arm. goodness knows where he had turned up from all this has been such a blow to me that i have not managed to call in at the epanchins. tomorrow i shall not see them either because i shall be in town. but though my town business is of course most pressing still i determined not to go away until i had seen you and had a clear understanding with you upon certain points and that without loss of time. you are not aware of that perhaps prince it will be a great deal better if they see that we are friendly just in an ordinary way. as for your remarks about friendship with me thanks very much indeed. you must excuse my being a little absent this evening. his mirth seemed very near the surface this evening. but what of that and and and as you are a capital fellow i am convinced of that i dare say we really shall end by being good friends. he became much excited when they approached the table once more. all this he found out afterwards at the moment he did not notice anything very particularly. dyou know i had a feeling that there would be a lot of people here tonight i wish i had known it was your birthday id have brought you a present perhaps i have got a present for you who knows ha ha then we will go to bed. lebedeff tell me is the sun the source of life we chose the general as president. go on or do you only mean it might be how are you going to save the world how are you going to save it i say by what by credit what is credit universal peace and the happiness of mankind as a whole being the result he even pulled colias silver watch out of his hand and looked at it eagerly. then as if he had forgotten everything he stretched himself out on the sofa put his hands behind his head and looked up at the sky. but it is just. you laugh you do not believe in the devil do you know who the devil is do you know his name he had been listening in silence up to that moment without taking part in the conversation but laughing heartily with the others from time to time. evidently he was delighted to see that everybody was amused that everybody was talking at once and even that everybody was drinking. i have often heard of them though i do not know much history. but it seems to me that it must have been so. a castle as you know is a kind of mountain of stones a dreadful almost an impossible labour they were very nearly laughing at him too but he did not notice it. why not thirty why did he not simply stop short at the number sixty and keep his secret until his last breath there must have been something stronger than the stake or the fire or even than the habits of twenty years there is more of riches but less of force. i have done. that is not the question. before the others had risen from the table gania had suddenly left off drinking and pushed away his glass a dark shadow seemed to come over his face. when they all rose he went and sat down by rogojin. rogojin who had also seemed on the point of going away now sat motionless his head bent seeming to have forgotten his intention. he had drunk no wine and appeared absorbed in reflection. from time to time he raised his eyes and examined everyone present one might have imagined that he was expecting something very important to himself and that he had decided to wait for it. evgenie pavlovitch made a sign with his head towards hippolyte whom he was attentively watching. the invalid was fast asleep stretched out on the sofa. he shuddered raised himself on his arm gazed around and grew very pale. are they all off is it all over tell me quick for goodness sake he realized that all was not over as yet that the sun had not risen and that the guests had merely gone to supper. ah rogojin wheres lebedeff has he finished what did he talk about is it true prince that you once declared that beauty would save the world great heaven gentlemen the prince is in love. i guessed it the moment he came in. dont blush prince you make me sorry for you. why so because i envy you eh you always think that i know. but do you know why i am saying all this look here what does it matter prince what can it matter what people will say of us then eh i believe im half asleep. ive had such a dreadful dream ive only just remembered it. prince i dont wish you such dreams as that though sure enough perhaps i dont love you. why wish a man evil though you do not love him eh i dont think i shall drink any more. what time is it never mind i know the time. the time has come at all events. what they are laying supper over there are they then this table is free capital gentlemen these gentlemen are not listening. prince i will just read over an article i have here. rogojin drew nearer to the table with a look on his face as if he knew what was coming. gania came nearer too so did lebedeff and the others the paper seemed to be an object of great interest to the company in general. i told you i would word of honour the prince observed that he was trembling all over. and what are you going to read hippolyte i wrote all day and all night and finished it this morning early. look how interested everybody is everybody has drawn near. look ha ha thats mystery that is now then gentlemen shall i break the seal or not say the word its a mystery i tell you a secret prince you know who said there would be no more time he appeared so strangely disturbed that many of those present could not help wondering. for a paper but the princes timid gesture had impressed even hippolyte. ha ha others said nothing but one and all sat down and watched with curiosity. they began to think something strange might really be about to happen. vera stood and trembled behind her fathers chair almost in tears with fright colia was nearly as much alarmed as she was. lebedeff jumped up and put a couple of candles nearer to hippolyte so that he might see better. look here gentlemen i beg to give notice that all this is very likely terrible nonsense. it is only a few ideas of mine. everyone seemed to see in a flash the same idea. he trembled so that the prince was obliged to support him and would certainly have cried out but that his voice seemed to have entirely left him for the moment. in the night then a smile of cunning almost triumph crossed his lips. it was between one and two at night you rose and went out at about three. it was you you at last he began. here is the article. my necessary explanation. as he never tells a lie there must be something in his words. his smile is a pleasant one. i have had a good look at him. i dont know whether i like him or not and i have no time to waste over the question. who knows perhaps i am going to pavlofsk on purpose to see him but why do i leave my chamber i must be quick and finish this explanation before tomorrow. this is my last and solemn but why need i call it that let me remember to consider am i mad at this moment or not or rather at these moments i can prove this tomorrow when i read it out by the impression it makes upon the audience. i must settle this question once and for all otherwise i cant go on with anything. but is it so according to his opinion i might die quite suddenly tomorrow for instance there had been such cases. but that he is an idiot at bottom there can be no doubt whatever. it so happened that just before he arrived i had a delightful little dream one of a kind that i have hundreds of just now. i had fallen asleep about an hour before he came in and dreamed that i was in some room not my own. i sat on a chair and kept my legs tucked under me. then the beast crawled quietly across the room and disappeared somewhere near my chair. i looked about for it in terror but i still hoped that as my feet were safely tucked away it would not be able to touch me. i jumped up and it disappeared. i did not dare lie down on my bed for fear it should creep under my pillow. my mother came into the room and some friends of hers. but they did not understand as i did. the beast stopped too but its tail and claws still moved about. the shell cracked in her teeth and the tail and legs stuck out of her mouth and shook about in a horrible manner. i was a fool i wont break off again. the first time that i felt really impressed with this thought was on the terrace at the princes at the very moment when i had taken it into my head to make a last trial of life. and yet i could not even read a book to the end i had given up reading. what is the good of reading what is the good of learning anything for just six months that thought has made me throw aside a book more than once. there was no spot on its dirty surface that i did not know by heart. i used to wait for colias arrival impatiently for i was so ill myself then that i could not leave the house. i could not understand among other things how all these people with so much life in and before them do not become rich and i dont understand it now. i remember being told of a poor wretch i once knew who had died of hunger. i was almost beside myself with rage why are they always anxious what is the meaning of their eternal care and worry oh i have no pity and no patience for these fools of people. if he has life all this must be in his power whose fault is it that he does not know how to live his life its all the same to me now now i have suffered already in reading so far. well let them laugh and say it is all nonsense if they please. i remember them all. the time for them is over. ask them ask any one of them or all of them what they mean by happiness what did the new world matter after all the important thing is life life and nothing else my position at home was solitary enough. i so often complained of them that i should think they must be very fond indeed of me by this time. i think i must have tormented my faithful colia as i called him a good deal too. i used to be so angry that i think i frightened him eventually for he stopped coming to see me. i must ask the prince about this for the expression is his. well the poor wretchs lips began to tremble and he caught me by the shoulder and pushed me to the door. go out he said in a whisper. i went out of course and i declare i liked it. i liked it at the very moment when i was turned out. at the very moment of the insult for i admit that i did insult him though i did not mean to this man could not lose his temper. his lips had trembled but i swear it was not with rage. he had taken me by the arm and said go out
without the least anger. but there was no anger. i used to go out at dusk. some moments passed before i found the bell and got it to ring. she listened silently to my questions did not understand a word of course and opened another door leading into a little bit of a room low and scarcely furnished at all but with a large wide bed in it hung with curtains. i did so and entered the next room. one could hardly squeeze through between the table and the bed. a curious scene followed. i thought it best to treat him so. my dear sir you little know what you have done for us. he interested me i confess i sat there nearly an hour. his story was a very ordinary one. even his wife was dragged into these. when i had finished and rose from my chair he was standing before me with an expression of alarmed curiosity. i repeated once more that i could not hold out much hope that it would probably end in smoke and if i did not turn up next morning they must make up their minds that there was no more to be done in the matter. i shall never forget the expression of their faces why whats the matter he cried in alarm. i shall attack my uncle about it tomorrow morning and im very glad you told me the story. ill do it though of course and at once if i can he added seeing that i rose seriously from my chair at this point. a month or so later my medical friend was appointed to another post. we were both a little drunk. he spoke to all as to brothers and every one of them looked upon him as a father. perhaps he read my thought in my face. at present nothing but the following consideration. on taking leave he pressed my hand warmly and asked permission to come and see me. a dreadful terror came over me at last and did not leave me all next day. ten days ago rogojin called upon me about certain business of his own with which i have nothing to do at present. i had never seen rogojin before but had often heard about him. for all that however i spent a very interesting hour and so i dare say did he. he remained silent he is a terribly silent man. colia sat with me until eleven oclock. he could not make up his mind what to do with the money and tore his hair over it. he had pointed it out to me himself as we walked past it and i believe i must have stood a good five minutes in front of it. but there was no such beauty in rogojins picture. i think it was about twelve or a little past that night. then he silently gazed at me and went quickly to the corner of the room where the lamp was burning and sat down underneath it. so passed two or three minutes and i recollect that his silence hurt and offended me very much. why did he not speak on the contrary though i had not actually told him my thought in the morning yet i know he understood it and this thought was of such a character that it would not be anything very remarkable if one were to come for further talk about it at any hour of night however late. i felt resolved that he should speak first. probably twenty minutes or so passed in this way. and yet now when the idea struck me that this was a ghost and not rogojin at all i was not in the least alarmed. when i now opened the door to her the thought suddenly struck me how could he have come in since the door was locked i made inquiries and found that rogojin himself could not possibly have come in because all our doors were locked for the night. i should not like this paper however to be made public. i request the prince to keep a copy himself and to give a copy to aglaya ivanovna epanchin. perhaps they do who knows there are plenty of merry souls among us i have no need to ask forgiveness of anyone. i wish to say a word merely because i happen to desire it of my own free will. and what do they want with their ridiculous pavlofsk trees oh i admit eternal life and perhaps i always did admit it. surely surely i need not suppose that somebody there will be offended because i do not wish to live out the fortnight allowed me i dont believe it. who will or can judge me after this no we had better drop religion. so be it. i shall die gazing straight at the great fountain of life and power i do not want this life suddenly hippolyte jumped up as though he had been shot. suddenly he became deadly pale and shuddered. im master of this house though i do not wish to lack respect towards you. but hippolyte was by no means weeping. he was about to move from his place when his four guards rushed at him and seized him once more. there was a laugh at this. to look at him one might have supposed that he was unconscious at intervals. what steps am i to take but tomorrow he must go elsewhere. excuse me prince should he refuse to deliver up his weapon then i shall instantly seize one of his arms and general ivolgin the other and we shall hold him until the police arrive and take the matter into their own hands. take him up colia my bag is upstairs in the princes study under the table. heres the key and in the little case youll find my pistol and the powder and all. colia packed it himself mr. lebedeff hell show you but its on condition that tomorrow morning when i leave for petersburg you will give me back my pistol do you hear colia stopped a moment as though he wished to say something but lebedeff dragged him away. hippolyte looked around at the laughing guests. whenever he addressed him he lowered his voice. stand still a moment i wish to look in your eyes dont speak stand so let me look at you there thats enough. ill lie down directly. i must drink to the suns health. i wish to i insist upon it reaching the steps hippolyte had paused holding the glass in his left hand while he put his right hand into his coat pocket. keller insisted afterwards that he had held his right hand in his pocket all the while when he was speaking to the prince and that he had held the latters shoulder with his left hand only. however this may be keller ran after hippolyte but he was too late. he caught sight of something flashing in hippolytes right hand and saw that it was a pistol. keller had hold of the pistol now. lebedeff and colia came rushing up at this moment. that he had thought he would have lots of time to put it in afterwards when required and that in the heat of the moment he had forgotten all about it. he threw himself upon the prince then on evgenie pavlovitch. the company departed very quickly in a mass. ptitsin gania and rogojin went away together. the prince was much astonished that evgenie pavlovitch changed his mind and took his departure without the conversation he had requested. the prince thought too that he looked vexed and annoyed and not nearly so friendly towards himself as he had been earlier in the night. hell live another six weeks all right. but you have to be very careful with this sort of gentleman. an hour later towards four oclock the prince went into the park. there was nothing to fear therefore at home. it was a recollection of switzerland during the first year of his cure the very first months. at that time he had been pretty nearly an idiot still he could not speak properly and had difficulty in understanding when others spoke to him. he looked out upon this long and anxiously. what had so tormented him was the idea that he was a stranger to all this that he was outside this glorious festival. oh he could not then speak these words or express all he felt at length a woman seemed to approach him. he knew her oh he knew her only too well. tears were trembling on her white cheek. she seemed to wish to show him something not far off in the park. he felt somebodys hand suddenly in his own seized it pressed it hard and awoke. before him stood aglaya laughing aloud. she laughed but she was rather angry too. was there no one else here aglaya did not begin the conversation but contented herself with watching her companion intently. he looked back at her but at times it was clear that he did not see her and was not thinking of her. among other things she seemed greatly interested in every word that evgenie pavlovitch had said and made the prince repeat that part of the story over and over again. i have a great deal to say to you. she seemed to be impatient to warn the prince about something or other. she was dressed very simply but this suited her well. she continually trembled and blushed and she sat on the very edge of the seat. he was very anxious that we should all come around him and say we were so sorry for him and that we loved him very much and all that and that we hoped he wouldnt kill himself but remain alive. how could he have me in view and not be aware of it himself and yet i dont know perhaps i do. do you know i have intended to poison myself at least thirty times ever since i was thirteen or so and to write to my parents before i did it i shall see hippolyte myself. tell him so. but of course i dont know for certain what he thought. perhaps he thought nothing but simply longed to see human faces once more and to hear human praise and feel human affection. who knows only it all came out wrong somehow. it wasnt nice of you that. that makes a difference perhaps. i understand quite well. you are very well how did she appear to you what did she look like i wish to make you a to ask you to be my friend. why did you think i invited you out here oh dear me all these changes in her expression came about so naturally and so rapidly they delighted the prince he watched her and laughed. half of what i have to say you heard yesterday. such a mind as they have never even dreamed of because really there are two minds the kind that matters and the kind that doesnt matter. but listen to the chief point. i have long thought over the matter and at last i have chosen you. i dont want to blush before prince s. or evgenie pavlovitch or anyone and therefore i have chosen you. i shall tell you everything everything even the most important things of all whenever i like and you are to hide nothing from me on your side. i want to speak to at least one person as i would to myself. they have suddenly begun to say that i am waiting for you and in love with you. they began this before you arrived here and so i didnt show them the letter and now they all say it every one of them. i want to be brave and be afraid of nobody. i dont want to go to their balls and things i want to do good. i have long desired to run away for i have been kept shut up for twenty years and they are always trying to marry me off. i wanted to run away when i was fourteen years old i was a little fool then i know but now i have worked it all out and i have waited for you to tell me about foreign countries. all this last year i have been preparing and reading forbidden books. i dont want to quarrel with my sisters but i told my parents long ago that i wish to change my social position. i have decided to take up teaching and i count on you because you said you loved children. can we go in for education together if not at once then afterwards we could do good together. i wont be a generals daughter any more im sorry for that. i thought you were. i wonder why i always thought so but at all events youll help me wont you if they dont say it they think it. i told them all so to their faces. i told mother and father and everybody. mamma was ill all the day after it and next day father and alexandra told me that i didnt understand what nonsense i was talking. he could not believe that this was the same haughty young girl who had once so proudly shown him ganias letter. what are you laughing at again how could such a horrible idea enter your sweet innocent heart i thought of you at the time as a kind of light. i only did it just to try you. dont look straight at me like that please turn your head away. you called it a horrible idea i only said it to shock you. very often i am myself afraid of saying what i intend to say and out it comes all the same. you have just told me that you wrote that letter at the most painful moment of your life. her lip continued to tremble for a long time. there was silence for a moment. the prince did not answer and there was silence again. i tell stories do i it is true you know he is greatly improved. he loves me better than his life. he brought a candle with him to this place be quiet cant you he brought a box of matches too if you like and then lighted the candle and held his finger in it for half an hour and more there ive noticed this. i know very well how you half a year since offered her your hand before everybody. after that she ran away with rogojin. then you like a wise man as you are came back here after her as soon as ever you heard that she had returned to petersburg. yesterday evening you sprang forward to protect her and just now you dreamed about her. you see i know all. oh why i should wish to tell you and only you this experience of mine i really cannot say perhaps it really is because i love you very much. this unhappy woman is persuaded that she is the most hopeless fallen creature in the world. do not cast stones at her do you know why she left me simply to prove to me what is not true that she is base. you dont suppose she can be happy among such people as those you cannot suppose that such society is fit for her i often wished to speak but i really did not know what to say. in some cases it is best to say nothing i think. oh yes but afterwards oh morning or evening now do you know what all this means what do you advise me surely you have not remarked everything else in her and only not this do you know what these letters mean she do you think she will ever really marry this rogojin as she says here she will that sort of thing becomes you well you know. why not do it and dont call me aglaya you have done it several times lately. who knows perhaps i still wish to but i know for certain that if she married me it would be her ruin i know this and therefore i leave her alone. i ought to go to see her today now i shall probably not go. she is proud she would never forgive me the nature of the love i bear her and we should both be ruined. you say she loves me as if this were love as if she could love me after what i have been through i havent slept thats all and im rather tired. perhaps it was that i seemed to come upon light in the midst of my gloom. i told you the truth when i said i did not know why i thought of you before all others. afterwards i began to work. aglaya rose from her seat. you dont mean what you say. whats all this before them stood lizabetha prokofievna. is your curiosity satisfied arrived at her house lizabetha prokofievna paused in the first room. the girls generally rose at about nine in the morning in the country aglaya of late had been in the habit of getting up rather earlier and having a walk in the garden but not at seven oclock about eight or a little later was her usual time. lizabetha prokofievna who really had not slept all night rose at about eight on purpose to meet aglaya in the garden and walk with her but she could not find her either in the garden or in her own room. this agitated the old lady considerably and she awoke her other daughters. next she learned from the maid that aglaya had gone into the park before seven oclock. she said that she wished to see me and speak to me about something important. very well ill tell them all not to come and wake you. here he sat down and covered his face with his hands and so remained for ten minutes. but the door opened again and out came colia. the prince actually felt glad that he had been interrupted and might return the letters to his pocket. what do you think of hippolyte now but look here colia im tired besides the subject is too melancholy to begin upon again. i quite understand you havent slept you walked about the park i know. she tried to persuade me not to come but i couldnt help myself just for one minute. burdovsky has gone. now lie down prince make yourself comfortable and sleep well but a man who knows for certain that he has but ten minutes to live and can talk like that why its its pride that is what a gigantic strength of will eh you know he deceived us last night the cunning rascal. i never packed his bag for him and i never saw his pistol. he packed it himself. but he put me off my guard like that you see. keller stayed a little while and then went over to lebedeffs to sleep. ferdishenko slept at lebedeffs too but he went away at seven oclock. my father is always at lebedeffs but he has gone out just now. i dare say lebedeff will be coming in here directly he has been looking for you i dont know what he wants. shall we let him in or not if you are asleep im going to have a nap too. burdovsky woke me at seven and i met my father just outside the room so drunk he didnt even know me. he stood before me like a log and when he recovered himself asked hurriedly how hippolyte was. is it really so he came into the room on his way out i was watching just then. well im off. oh heres lebedeff himself he had but just returned and carried his hat in his hand. the prince begged him to take a chair. oh dear no yesterday my ideas were a little well mixed. oh i had my purse in my pocket. my own name doesnt appear. i only asked for information excuse the question. indeed it is. im only put out about this. burdovsky and colia i except of course. the general myself keller and ferdishenko. one of us four it must have been. do go on lebedeff the general decided that he was innocent. we awoke him for further inquiries and had the greatest difficulty in making him understand what was up. it was foolish of me to say i was afraid he left his address you see when he went. now prince consider why did he leave his address no no this is as good as saying there how can i be a thief when i leave my address there was a look of cunning in his eyes however. i assure you i am not worth it at least not i alone. ha ha ha dear me he did amuse me did the general i love that man sir i may have told you so before it is a weakness of mine. search me he says you searched keller why dont you search me too it is only fair says he. and all the while his legs and hands were trembling with anger and he as white as a sheet all over you are the one friend left to me amid all my misfortunes says he. he went on to tell me a story of how he had been accused or suspected of stealing five hundred thousand roubles once as a young man and how the very next day he had rushed into a burning blazing house and saved the very count who suspected him and nina alexandrovna who was then a young girl from a fiery death. the count embraced him and that was how he came to marry nina alexandrovna he said. as for the money it was found among the ruins next day in an english iron box with a secret lock it had got under the floor somehow and if it had not been for the fire it would never have been found besides hes my friend prince so that i shall not lose sight of him again. where he goes i go. i dont know why its at that time. but he has no money and its no use his going to see her without. he meant to ask you i know for he said so. money why i would give that man not only my money but my very life if he wanted it. he is going to town with me now for you must know i am off to petersburg after ferdishenko while the scent is hot im certain he is there. i merely wish to make him ashamed of himself. we might manage it with the help of nina alexandrovna so that he might be closely watched in his own house. or colia either. you know the sort of man he is. muishkin frowned and rose from his seat. this ferdishenko i would not say a word against him of course but who knows perhaps it really was he one has to take care not to say too much you understand i say this to prove that he really is so to speak more likely to have done this than anyone else eh you understand of course i dont altogether believe it. i am very sorry that i should have had to say this because i assure you i dont believe it myself it is all nonsense of course. he had risen from his seat and was trying to keep step with the prince running after him up and down. of course he only lies with the best intentions still he lies. but such being the case where could you have heard the same report dear me ha no one must know no one mind you and i together softly he longed to get up and go to her at once but he could not. these letters too were like a dream. we sometimes have strange impossible dreams contrary to all the laws of nature. the reading of these letters produced some such effect upon the prince. how could she ever have made up her mind to write to her he asked himself. how could she write about that at all and how could such a wild idea have entered her head for hours he was haunted by what he had read. i have seen you i see you every day. but i must confess one sin against you i love you. i have not lowered you to my level even in my most secret thoughts. i have written do not fear as if you could fear. i am not putting myself on a level with you he fell in love with you though he saw you but once. but i understood without his saying it that you were all that light is to him. i lived near him for a whole month and i understood then that you too must love him. perhaps it was only my fancy. no one can wrong you. do you know i think you ought to love me for you are the same in my eyes as in his you are as light. an angel cannot hate perhaps cannot love either. i often ask myself is it possible to love everybody indeed it is not it is not in nature. but you are different. oh i should paint one little child left with him. the sun is setting. there you have my picture. what is my passion to you for my own sake naturally. god knows what it is dwelling within me now it is not myself. i can see it every day in two dreadful eyes which are always looking at me even when not present. these eyes are silent now they say nothing but i know their secret. his house is gloomy and there is a secret in it. just as in the moscow case. i could have shown you the very spot my wedding and yours are to be on the same day so i have arranged with him. i have no secrets from him. i would kill him from very fright but he will kill me first. at last the prince came out of the dark gloomy park in which he had wandered about for hours just as yesterday. he had forgotten his watch. there was a sound of distant music somewhere. he opened the door into the room but it too was dark and empty. he stood in the middle of the room in perplexity. suddenly the door opened and in came alexandra candle in hand. adelaida has gone to bed and i am just going. we were alone the whole evening. his heart was beating his thoughts were confused everything around seemed to be part of a dream. the woman appeared to step out from the park and stand in the path in front of him as though she had been waiting for him there. there she stood at last face to face with him for the first time since their parting. she said something but he looked silently back at her. oh are you happy now today this moment have you just been with her the prince noticed that rogojin had suddenly appeared at her side and had taken her arm and was leading her away. the prince was waiting for him. she expected that you would be with them all the evening. i told her exactly what you wrote me. she wont write to the girl any more she promises and tomorrow she will be off as you wish. the prince made no reply. remember me kindly and he disappeared without looking round again. this class as i have said above is far less happy. at the moment when he lost aglaya and after the scene with nastasia he had felt so low in his own eyes that he actually brought the money back to the prince. he lived at ptitsins and openly showed contempt for the latter though he always listened to his advice and was sensible enough to ask for it when he wanted it. perhaps a certain kind of pride came to her help. indeed who is free from them besides she knew that her marriage would provide a refuge for all her family. for weeks at a time she would never mention gania. she noticed this at certain times more than at others and especially after her visits to the epanchins. she very well knew that if she kept quiet and asked her brother nothing about his reason for tearing up and down the room his wrath would fall upon her head. no heaven knows whats up now i dont for whom no no varia that wont do it wont do i tell you hes all to blame himself and yet he puts on so much side that youd think my word its too much trouble to go through the gate you must break the fence for me thats the sort of air he puts on but whats the matter with you varia gania looked more intently at her. i discovered that its all true. my husband was wiser than either of us. just as he suspected from the beginning so it has fallen out. well what has happened the elder sisters told me about it. aglaya has agreed. they dont attempt to conceal it any longer you know how mysterious and secret they have all been up to now. adelaidas wedding is put off again so that both can be married on one day. they are only afraid that he may knock something down or trip over something when he comes into the room. of course you did. now its all over and a good thing too pair of fools that we have been i confess i have never been able to look at it seriously. you can judge for yourself. i think the general is pleased enough her mother is a little uneasy. the bridegroom is an impossible and ridiculous one. it was sure to be so with her. you know what she is like. you remember how she used to hide in a cupboard as a child so as to avoid seeing visitors for hours at a time. she is just the same now but do you know i think there is something serious in the matter even from her side i feel it somehow. he walks in the clouds they say he is extremely funny just now i heard it from themselves. however at this moment the noise began again upstairs. what do you mean speak you have just been there. varia followed and caught him by both hands. where are you going to he came to see the general who was not at home so he asked for lizabetha prokofievna. aglaya perhaps knows. she alone though if anyone for the sisters were as astonished as i was to hear her speak so seriously. its not a great matter to guess who told her. a thief nonsense why who invented the whole thing lebedeff and the prince a pretty pair go on. you think that all this sort of thing would harm you in aglayas eyes do you you little know her character. you never could or did understand how interesting you would have seen in her eyes if you had come firmly and proudly through our misfortunes. i thought the prince would manage to hold his tongue about this at least. what does it matter to you now in any case what are you hoping for still varia had risen from her place and had started to go upstairs to her mother but at this observation of ganias she turned and gazed at him attentively. tell me that. he found it out himself of course. why you have no idea what a cunning little animal he is dirty little gossip believe it or not but im pretty sure he has got round aglaya. rogojin is intimate with him too. how the prince doesnt notice it i cant understand. what on earth does it matter to him when hes dying i confess i was fool enough to attempt something through him at first. but i know him better now. of course i understood and the little wretch looked at me with a nasty sort of satisfaction. and why doesnt he die i should like to know listen to that noise i really cant stand this any longer. he was followed by nina alexandrovna colia and behind the rest hippolyte. ii. he did not quarrel with the prince in fact they seemed to part as friends. for some reason or other rogojin too had begun to visit the sick boy. the prince thought it might be better for him to move away from his the princes house. gania was right when he told his sister that hippolyte was getting better that he was better was clear at the first glance. nina alexandrovna came in looking frightened. she had changed much since we last saw her half a year ago and had grown thin and pale. colia looked worried and perplexed. but he could see that his father had of late changed very much and that he had begun to behave in so extraordinary a fashion both at home and abroad that he was not like the same man. what perplexed and disturbed him as much as anything was that his father had entirely given up drinking during the last few days. make your choice sir make your choice quickly if you please i am a general not a bottle sir. somebody pushed him back into his chair and begged him to be calm. nina alexandrovna trembled and cried quietly. gania retired to the window in disgust. what did gavrila bring you over here for i what do you mean you young calf i shame you gania was very angry too. it is just a week you see i count the days. why did you go to the epanchins yesterday tell me that and you call yourself an old man too with grey hair and father of a family you all heard it. i dont wish for your company general. i closed his eyes for him he was killed. the old man grew purple in the face he raised his hands. his wife colia and ptitsin ran out after him. and just at this moment his eye met hippolytes. dont you think so i am today informed that my room is ready for me therefore having thanked your sister and mother for their kindness to me i intend to leave the house this evening. now then i am ready to hear you. youll be dreadfully sorry afterwards if you dont speak out now. come you shall have the first say. very well. i shall be as short as possible for my part. two or three times today i have had the word hospitality pushed down my throat this is not fair. i will not go into details. but there is no need whatever for me to hate him. i quite understood your brother when he first offered me aid against the prince though i did not show it i knew well that your brother was making a ridiculous mistake in me. i should not enjoy paradise nearly so much without having done this first. gania had grown very pale he trembled but said nothing. he then turned his gaze upon varia bowed and went out without adding another word. varia dared not speak to him for a long while as he strode past her backwards and forwards. at last he went and stood at the window looking out with his back turned towards her. there was a fearful row going on upstairs again. it looked like a little note. i should like to meet you tomorrow morning at seven oclock by the green bench in the park. it is not far from our house. the chief thing is that she wants to see you after six months absence. look here gania this is a serious business. as if she could possibly avoid seeing what i have been working for all this last six months and just imagine i was there this morning and not a word of this i was there you know on the sly. the old lady did not know or she would have kicked me out. i ran some risk for you you see. where are you off to the neighbours undoubtedly did hear. varia rushed out of the room. iii. he had before this experienced fits of sudden fury but not very often because he was really a man of peaceful and kindly disposition. but on this occasion there was something more serious than usual. everyone seemed to know something but to be afraid to talk about it. there had also been a scene with the prince. the fact is that probably hippolyte was not quite so black as gania painted him and it was hardly likely that he had informed nina alexandrovna of certain events of which we know for the mere pleasure of giving her pain. the course of events had marched in the following order. the two friends did not seem ever to be parted for a moment. muishkin was usually out all day and only came home late at night. on his return he was invariably informed that colia had been looking for him. he thought as so many in his position do that nobody had seen heard noticed or understood anything. i experience this every morning. i came to speak to you about another matter though an important matter. the fact is i came for advice. but this is all mere nonsense. i came here to speak of something quite different something very important prince. the old man was very pale every now and then his lips trembled and his hands seemed unable to rest quietly but continually moved from place to place. he had twice already jumped up from his chair and sat down again without being in the least aware of it. he immediately changed his tone and started off on a long and solemn explanation. but listen as he would the prince could make neither head nor tail of it. but you are young accept my blessing my principal object is to beg you to fix an hour for a most important conversation that is my great hope prince. now is a dream and it is too too important it is to be the hour of fate to me my own hour. i dont say mine mind you will understand me prince. only you understand me prince no one else. the general left him much comforted and far less agitated than when he had arrived. at seven in the evening the prince sent to request lebedeff to pay him a visit. he described the mornings interview in a few words. it is too much neglected. oh no prince i may serve you but only as your humble slave i am not angry oh no the prince looked back at him in amazement. dont be angry with me not only yours everybody elses also you are waiting to hear something from me at this very moment with such simplicity that i declare i feel quite ashamed of myself for having nothing whatever to tell you. i swear to you solemnly that there is nothing to tell. there lebedeff assumed an air of dignity. what are you up to i cant make you out the money the money sir the four hundred roubles that you lost that day. you came and told me about it one morning and then went off to petersburg. impossible why you told me yourself that you had searched every corner of the room very much so i looked and scrambled about and felt for it and wouldnt believe it was not there and looked again and again. it is always so in such cases. but how was it in your case i mean what did the general say when the purse turned up under the chair but the second time i thought better to say nothing about finding it. besides i wanted to appear myself to have found nothing. you see i was half in hopes the general might find it. because if i found it why should not he too observe an object lying before his very eyes he is very absent just now evidently. ha ha and think of this prince my pockets are always strong and whole and yet here in one night is a huge hole. i am not a military man you know. do you hear he is asking your pardon. i honour you for it prince. very well thats settled i shall find the purse now and not tomorrow. here i find it and take it out before your eyes and the money is all right. take it prince and keep it till tomorrow will you tomorrow or next day ill take it back again. no no better say nothing about it. he awaited next mornings interview with the general most impatiently. iv. he seemed strangely timid before the general this morning for some reason and felt as though his visitor were some piece of china which he was afraid of breaking. well did you read it general some of his remarks were wonderfully interesting. i broke with him last night and am very sorry that i did not do so before. i expect respect prince even from those to whom i give my heart so to speak. prince i have often given away my heart and am nearly always deceived. go on i dont mind you see we were talking over this period of history. truth very often appears to be impossible. i was a page it sounds strange i dare say. why i know of a murder for the sake of a watch. its in all the papers now. the world was full of his name i so to speak drew it in with my mothers milk. just so i was already in high favour. they were nearly out of their minds about me at home. he was dreadfully agitated. sometimes at night i would throw myself upon his breast with tears oh how i loved that man. you are quite right. oh i was so angry with his work i wrote to him and said i forget what at this moment. you ask whether i was very busy under the emperor oh no i was called page but hardly took my duty seriously. my heart was greatly drawn to him too. my duties were light. i merely had to be at the palace occasionally to escort the emperor out riding and that was about all. i rode very fairly well. suddenly his eye fell on me and an idea seemed to flash across him. napoleon liked the idea it attracted him. all was decided at last. they were alone together those two and myself. where to asked napoleon. napoleon shuddered his fate was being decided. go home he looked at me kindly. napoleon started reflected and said you remind me of a third heart which loves me. how well you bring out that fact how old is your sister
he asked holding the pen in his hand. three years old i said. heavens its two oclock how i have kept you prince i gaze at you with a feeling of real affection. oh heaven bless you mine is over. but his answer was a fit of violent laughter which lasted ten whole minutes. the same evening he received a strange letter short but decided. colia did not understand the position. and my own son to say it he was married afterwards and then killed on the field of battle. you and nina will come to my grave colia poor nina i always used to call her nina in the old days and how she loved....
nina nina oh nina. look here dear old father come back home lets go back to mother. look she ran after us when we came out. what have you stopped her for just as though you didnt take in what i said what is there to surprise anyone in that what has happened to you why dont you wish to come back home dont shout you shall hear. oh i am sad i am melancholy come home at once come on ill punch ganias head myself if you like only come. he sat down on the step still holding colia by the hand. what do you mean so said the sisters. there was a question to be decided most important but most difficult so much so that mrs. epanchin did not even see how to put it into words. would the prince do or not was all this good or bad if good which might be the case of course why good this was in the morning but in the evening alone with his wife he had given tongue again. hearing these words from her husband lizabetha prokofievna was driven beside herself. whom can he be shown to where can you take him to for some reason or other the sisters liked the idea of the prince. but both of them decided to say nothing either way. alexandra however found it difficult to keep absolute silence on the subject. why did no one say anything about it at first alexandra had been very careful and had merely replied that perhaps her fathers remark was not so far out that in the eyes of the world probably the choice of the prince as a husband for one of the epanchin girls would be considered a very wise one. the princess was aglayas godmother. she returned home to pavlofsk in a worse humour than when she left and of course everybody in the house suffered. so far as she could see nothing whatever had happened. but alas peace did not reign for more than ten minutes. this trip had taken place the day after that on which the prince had turned up at the epanchins at nearly one oclock at night thinking it was nine. suddenly a quarter of an hour after the princes departure aglaya had rushed out of her room in such a hurry that she had not even wiped her eyes which were full of tears. she came back because colia had brought a hedgehog. everybody came in to see the hedgehog. but aglaya so entreated them that at last they consented to sell her the hedgehog. aglaya burst out laughing and ran up to her room highly delighted. her good spirits lasted the whole day. what on earth did it all mean what did they understand by it he was almost in despair when colia arrived with the hedgehog. then the sky cleared in a moment. the prince seemed to arise from the dead he asked colia all about it made him repeat the story over and over again and laughed and shook hands with the boys in his delight. the prince blushed but this time he said nothing. colia burst out laughing and clapped his hands. a minute later the prince laughed too and from this moment until the evening he looked at his watch every other minute to see how much time he had to wait before evening came. lizabetha prokofievna went to bed and only rose again in time for tea when the prince might be expected. this evening there were no strangers present no one but the immediate members of the family. prince s. was still in town occupied with the affairs of evgenie pavlovitchs uncle. alas aglaya still did not come and the prince was quite lost. at this moment in marched aglaya as calm and collected as could be. the prince started. is there any ground for all these questions or not there was a general stir in the room. its impossible. what is there to say to such a question have a little rest and try to recover yourself. we are not children we must look into it thoroughly. that would increase our income nicely. at length she jumped up and ran out of the room. the two sisters hurriedly went after her. the prince and the general were the only two persons left in the room. he was evidently so much agitated that he hardly knew what he wished to say. and what does it all mean and then is all this a joke on her part or is she in earnest here she is all of her her mother covered her with a corner of her shawl. she had flushed up all over and her eyes were blazing. he is waiting alone downstairs. ill go down myself directly. ill just go in and then you can follow me almost at once. however she turned and ran down to the prince as fast as her feet could carry her. undoubtedly the fact that he might now come and see aglaya as much as he pleased again was quite enough to make him perfectly happy that he might come and speak to her and see her and sit by her and walk with her who knows but that all this was quite enough to satisfy him for the whole of his life and that he would desire no more to the end of time lizabetha prokofievna felt that this might be the case and she didnt like it though very probably she could not have put the idea into words. however he decided to say no more about it and merely to look on and take his time and tune from lizabetha prokofievna. read on now. no dont prince s.
had returned and aglaya was particularly amiable to him and asked a great deal after evgenie pavlovitch. muishkin had not come in as yet. perhaps he was too easy in his mind. so thought hippolyte at all events who met him in the park one day. would you believe it they invited me there under the express condition that i should die quickly and they are all as wild as possible with me for not having died yet and for being on the contrary a good deal better you are not nearly so simple as they try to make you out this is not the time for it or i would tell you a thing or two about that beauty gania and his hopes. but alas what a thing to be melancholy about im sorry to say i have no right to answer you as for gania i put it to you can any man have a happy mind after passing through what he has had to suffer i think that is the best way to look at it. you must put out your finger and touch a thing before youll believe it eh ha ha ha whatever may have appeared to the contrary i give you my word i see this more plainly every day. ha ha ha in the first place they havent died yet and in the second if they did die all of them what would be the satisfaction to me in that there was a moments pause of mutual confusion. it really appears to me that they were of another race altogether than ourselves of today. ha ha ha you are a regular child prince never mind never mind im not a bit angry at all events we have had a very funny talk. however i see i must make arrangements to die soon or i myself . well leave me now look here before you go just give me your opinion how do you think i ought to die now ha ha i thought so. i thought i should hear something like that. well you are you really are oh dear me moreover it was only a question of a small gathering of a few intimate friends. evgenie pavlovitch who was to escort the princess was the only young man. he could not help observing the excited and agitated condition of all members of the family and from certain hints dropped in conversation he gathered that they were all anxious as to the impression he should make upon the princess. he was occupied with altogether different thoughts. the prince jumped to the conclusion that aglaya too was nervous about him and the impression he would make and that she did not like to admit her anxiety and this thought alarmed him. she was evidently in difficulties as to how best to go on. i dont speak of father for he cannot be expected to be anything but what he is. but she is such a slave to these miserable creatures how mean it all is and how foolish my sisters are all for it. what would it matter to me if you were to make ever such a fool of yourself how can you say such a thing what do you mean by making a fool of yourself i suppose you intend to talk in that sort of way tomorrow evening im sorry for it then for i should have had a good laugh at you otherwise. do break something at least in the drawingroom its a valuable one do break it. shell cry before everyone youll see then you are afraid you will wave your arms about i shall dream of it all night now. aglaya stamped her foot and grew quite pale with anger. just listen to that better not come when the party is on purpose for him good lord why do you talk to me like this i wont do it again. i know quite well i see it that you are anxious on my account now dont be angry and it makes me very happy to see it. i give you my word it is i am so pleased that you are such a child such a dear good child. of course not. youve taken to looking too gloomy sometimes aglaya much more than you used to. i have long wished to say it and have said it but thats not enough for you didnt believe me. at this moment she was called by someone. she broke loose from him with an air of relief and ran away. the prince was in a fever all night. all night he fancied himself in some extraordinary society of strange persons. the worst of it was that he was talking nonsense he knew that he ought not to speak at all and yet he talked the whole time he seemed to be trying to persuade them all to something. evgenie and hippolyte were among the guests and appeared to be great friends. for some reason or other he felt most anxious to see rogojin to see and talk to him but what he wished to say he could not tell. next he determined to go and see hippolyte. from whom he sat stiff with wonder lebedeff said some extraordinary things. in the first place he began about some letter the name of aglaya ivanovna came in. didnt i tell you ha ha ha i thought i had. all the prince could gather was that the letter had been received very early and had a request written on the outside that it might be sent on to the address given. to a certain person and from a certain hand. the individuals name who wrote the letter is to be represented by the letter a. impossible to nastasia philipovna as he kept jumping from subject to subject and forgetting what he had begun to talk about the prince said nothing but waited to give him time. it was all very vague. who had taken the letters if letters there were probably vera and how could lebedeff have got them so the prince concluded at last. if anybody can have been such a fool as to trust a man like you to deliver the letter says she take it and deliver it hey you are nothing but a spy. what did you mean to complain of today what did you expect to get by it thats all. he did not dare put his suggestion into words again. all this had been very painful to listen to. something must be done that was clear. he looked at the address on the letter once more. oh he was not in the least degree alarmed about aglaya writing such a letter he could trust her. what he did not like about it was that he could not trust gania. however he made up his mind that he would himself take the note and deliver it. indeed he went so far as to leave the house and walk up the road but changed his mind when he had nearly reached ptitsins door. she heard with horror that her father had taken it. the latter with one thing and another was now so disturbed and confused that when a couple of hours or so later a message came from colia that the general was ill he could hardly take the news in. he went at once to nina alexandrovnas whither the general had been carried and stayed there until the evening. he could do no good but there are people whom to have near one is a blessing at such times. the general was brought round to some extent but the doctors declared that he could not be said to be out of danger. lebedeff turned up late in the afternoon he had been asleep ever since his interview with the prince in the morning. till the generals death indeed he spent almost all his time at his side. twice during the day a messenger came to nina alexandrovna from the epanchins to inquire after the invalid. when late in the evening the prince made his appearance in lizabetha prokofievnas drawingroom he found it full of guests. somehow or other he felt that all these people must have been born on purpose to be together the prince would never so much as suspect such a thing in the delight of his first impression. meanwhile all these people though friends of the family and of each other to a certain extent were very far from being such intimate friends of the family and of each other as the prince concluded. it was not a large party however. he was always very cool to him while taking advantage of his ready services and would instantly have put another in his place if there had been the slightest reason for the change. she was a lady of weight in her own way. it so happened however that on this particular evening all these good people were in excellent humour and highly pleased with themselves. every one of them felt that they were doing the epanchins the greatest possible honour by their presence. but alas she herself looked wonderfully beautiful this evening. evgenie had been known in society for a long while. the prince remarked that aglaya looked attentively at him two or three times and seemed to be satisfied with his behaviour. little by little he became very happy indeed. the prince quickly turned towards him and listened. when general epanchin introduced us just now i recognized you at once prince. you are very little changed though i saw you last as a child of some ten or eleven years old. you dont remember me the prince listened to all this with eyes sparkling with emotion and delight. he declared further that he had intended to go every day but had always been prevented by circumstances but that now he would promise himself the pleasure however far it was he would find them out. she was severe perhaps but then what else could she be with such a little idiot as he was then ha ha. ha ha. so he had really seen him there good heavens and was he really and truly and actually a cousin of pavlicheffs i didnt say it because i doubt the fact you know. ha ha. how could i doubt such a thing ha ha ha. i dont know what to say. why was he so agitated why this was it would be difficult to say. he was much too happy. aglaya seemed a little startled as for lizabetha prokofievna her heart sank within her. this was odd of lizabetha prokofievna and her daughters. they had themselves decided that it would be better if the prince did not talk all the evening. the old man was evidently interested in him and anxious to study him more closely. yes that is my opinion. this is my own personal conviction and it has long distressed me. by their works ye shall know them we are told. and we must not suppose that all this is harmless and without danger to ourselves. oh no we must resist and quickly quickly if you would make up your mind to live more among your fellows in society i trust i am sure that the world would be glad to welcome you as a remarkable young man and you would soon find yourself able to look at things more calmly. oh no you are wrong there say from thirst if you like the thirst of fever why is this why is this such is our anguish of thirst he did not say exactly these words. but so it was. as he spoke his last words he had risen suddenly from his seat with a wave of his arm and there was a general cry of horror. thank god it was not that he drew a long breath and looked around. he saw them gather up the broken bits of china he heard the loud talking of the guests and observed how pale aglaya looked and how very strangely she was gazing at him. there was no hatred in her expression and no anger whatever. it was full of alarm for him and sympathy and affection while she looked around at the others with flashing angry eyes. his heart filled with a sweet pain as he gazed at her. at length he observed to his amazement that all had taken their seats again and were laughing and talking as though nothing had happened. he took the prince by the hand and pressed it warmly then he patted it and quietly urged him to recollect himself speaking to him exactly as he would have spoken to a little frightened child which pleased the prince wonderfully and next seated him beside himself. the prince gazed into his face with pleasure but still seemed to have no power to speak. his breath failed him. the old mans face pleased him greatly. cheer up. probably the prince heard him. you will not believe how happy i am to be able to think so. it is as it should be. he seemed to inquire whether he might speak. i was most afraid of myself. when i returned to petersburg i promised myself to make a point of seeing our greatest men and members of our oldest families the old families like my own. i am now among princes like myself am i not i wished to know you and it was necessary very very necessary. there is so much written and said about you the prince certainly was beside himself. imagine how delighted i must have been and how surprised oh let me express this feeling i have so often heard and i have even believed that in society there was nothing but empty forms and that reality had vanished but i now see for myself that this can never be the case here among us it may be the order elsewhere but not in russia. could such words come from the lips of a man who is dead is there not material for the future in all this for hope can such people fail to understand i have no right to express my ideas and said so long ago. only in moscow with rogojin did i ever speak absolutely freely i know it would be much better if i were always to sit still and say nothing. when i do so i appear to be quite a sensible sort of a person and whats more i think about things. but now i must speak it is better that i should. i began to speak because you looked so kindly at me you have such a beautiful face. oh no im not indeed my ideas are all so simple. you dont believe me you are smiling. do you know i am sometimes very wicked for i lose my faith this evening as i came here i thought to myself what shall i talk about ah we dont look thoroughly into matters dont care to understand things. we are all like this you and i and all of them why here are you now you are not a bit angry with me for calling you odd are you and if so surely there is good material in you do you know i sometimes think it is a good thing to be odd. we can forgive one another more easily and be more humble. no one can begin by being perfect there is much one cannot understand in life at first. and if we take in knowledge too quickly we very likely are not taking it in at all. i say all this to you you who by this time understand so much and doubtless have failed to understand so much also. i am not afraid of you any longer. you are not angry that a mere boy should say such words to you are you of course not you know how to forget and to forgive. it is best simply to give a good example simply to begin the work. i have done this i have begun and and oh can anyone be unhappy really oh what does grief matter what does misfortune matter if one knows how to be happy do you know i cannot understand how anyone can pass by a green tree and not feel happy only to look at it how anyone can talk to a man and not feel happy in loving him oh it is my own fault that i cannot express myself well enough but there are lovely things at every step i take things which even the most miserable man must recognize as beautiful. she had guessed the state of the case before anyone else. there he lay on the carpet and someone quickly placed a cushion under his head. no one had expected this. true enough most of the guests next day and the day after were not in very good humour. he was a man who really did possess a kind heart although his interest in the prince in the earlier part of the evening was due among other reasons to the latters connection with nastasia philipovna according to popular report. he had heard a good deal of this story here and there and was greatly interested in it so much so that he longed to ask further questions about it. i thought i should hear a very different tone from you. it was all settled in aglayas mind. his attack of yesterday had been a slight one. his brain worked all right though his soul was heavy within him. he rose late and immediately upon waking remembered all about the previous evening he also remembered though not quite so clearly how half an hour after his fit he had been carried home. he soon heard that a messenger from the epanchins had already been to inquire after him. vera lebedeff was one of the first to come to see him and offer her services. he was quite struck by the girls deep sympathy for him he seized her hand and kissed it. vera flushed crimson. she went hastily out of the room in a state of strange confusion. he could not speak. he listened silently and cried softly to himself the while. the prince perceived that this was an impression which would last for the whole of the boys life. he made haste to explain his view of the matter and pointed out that the old mans approaching death was probably brought on by horror at the thought of his action and that it was not everyone who was capable of such a feeling. colias eyes flashed as he listened. i shall not quarrel with them but from this moment our feet shall not travel the same road. oh prince i have felt much that is quite new to me since yesterday it is a lesson for me. i heard yesterday but i have no right to talk about this... if you ever want a true friend and servant neither you nor i are so very happy are we come to me. lebedeff had asked questions colia had hinted and vera had shed tears. what was it lizabetha prokofievna had announced directly after lunch that they would all take a walk together. she as though anxious to avoid any conversation walked ahead silent and alone. whatever aglaya may think and in spite of anything that may happen he is not a stranger to us besides which he is ill and in misfortune. i for one shall call in and see him. hm so you can see that there was a scene can you i advise you to have a walk and then go to sleep again if you can. come in as usual if you feel inclined and be assured once for all whatever happens and whatever may have happened you shall always remain the friend of the family mine at all events. the prince began to think of aglaya. she had looked very intently at him but that was all. vera came in three minutes after the epanchins had left. she only just had time to whisper as she went by but by the way she looked at me i knew it was important. left alone he lay down on the sofa and began to think. at last he came to himself. hippolyte laughed. i am off there you know and this time i believe seriously that i am off its all over. i did not come here for sympathy believe me. why didnt you send me a message enough im sorry i wasnt there. ive come about something important. i was astonished to see what a fool a man can look. i remarked upon the fact to aglaya ivanovna when he had gone. come thats news but no perhaps better not tell me. but you may have been sitting behind the bushes somewhere. however i am very glad on your account of course. i know scarcely anything and aglaya ivanovna is aware that i know nothing. i knew nothing whatever about this meeting. you say there was a meeting. you said you knew and now suddenly you know nothing but do you know what these good people have in their minds eye gania and his sister perhaps you are suspicious i have made such a quantity of them already. i dont know whether i came there too early i think i must have but scarcely had i sat down beside aglaya ivanovna than i saw gavrila ardalionovitch and his sister varia coming along arm in arm just as though they were enjoying a morning walk together. both of them seemed very much astonished not to say disturbed at seeing me they evidently had not expected the pleasure. aglaya ivanovna blushed up and was actually a little confused. i dont know whether it was merely because i was there or whether ganias beauty was too much for her but anyway she turned crimson and then finished up the business in a very funny manner. im glad that you are not above ordinary human feelings for once. i dont suppose anyone even a woman would raise a hand against me now. i did think at one time yesterday that he would fly at me though. i bet anything that i know what you are thinking of now ill tell you who it was rogojin well well leave that question just now. and mind after she had heard every word i had to tell her and had asked all sorts of questions besides but such is the way of women. for her sake i entered into relations with rogojin an interesting man at her request i arranged a personal interview between herself and nastasia philipovna. at all events they all used it at ganias and she used it herself. his mind was filled with dread and horror. surely you must know that there is to be a meeting today between nastasia and aglaya ivanovna and that nastasia has been sent for on purpose through rogojin from st. petersburg and yet where should you have heard it however ive warned you and you may be grateful to me. one more thing dont think that i am telling you all this for your sake. oh dear no i did though and how she took it ha ha oh no you dont know the habits of that house she could not get away alone to nastasia philipovnas when the moment comes and theres nothing else to be done our young lady will go to nastasia philipovnas i said so to her and she quite agreed with me. wait till seven or eight oclock. in your place i would send someone there to keep watch so as to seize the exact moment when she steps out of the house. send colia. hell play the spy with pleasure for you at least. there was no reason for the prince to set anyone to watch even if he had been capable of such a thing. aglayas command that he should stay at home all day seemed almost explained now. perhaps she meant to call for him herself or it might be of course that she was anxious to make sure of his not coming there and therefore bade him remain at home. he lay down on the sofa and closed his eyes. one way or the other the question was to be decided at last finally. he had long since feared that she might take some such step as this. but why did she wish to see nastasia no he did not account her a child. and now it was all to be cleared up. it was a dreadful thought. if he had tried to forget her all this time it was simply because he was afraid of her. did he love the woman or hate her this question he did not once ask himself today his heart was quite pure. he knew whom he loved. he could remember that vera brought him some dinner and that he took it but whether he slept after dinner or no he could not recollect. he only knew that he began to distinguish things clearly from the moment when aglaya suddenly appeared and he jumped up from the sofa and went to meet her. it was just a quarter past seven then. aglaya was quite alone and dressed apparently hastily in a light mantle. he had never seen that expression in her eyes before. she gazed attentively at him. i see somebody has thought fit to warn you and i know who. you know i suppose that you must escort me there this was his one attempt to stop the mad child and after he had made it he followed her as though he had no will of his own. they walked silently and said scarcely a word all the way. no sooner had the carriage driven off than the door opened once more and rogojin who had apparently been awaiting them let them in and closed it after them. nastasia philipovna was waiting for them in the first room they went into. she was dressed very simply in black. she rose at their entrance but did not smile or give her hand even to the prince. her anxious eyes were fixed upon aglaya. both sat down at a little distance from one another aglaya on the sofa in the corner of the room nastasia by the window. the prince and rogojin remained standing and were not invited to sit. the silence continued for some few moments. aglaya was clearly confused but not frightened. at length she looked straight into nastasias eyes and instantly read all there was to read in her rivals expression. woman understood woman aglaya shuddered. aglaya blushed. at the first sound of nastasias voice a shudder ran through her frame. dear me yet it appeared that not one of the four persons in the room considered this in any degree strange. he would have given half his life to prevent aglaya from speaking of them. i came to speak to you as... as one human being to another. so much the worse for you not for myself listen to my reply to all your letters. your letters to me are a proof of it. aglaya flushed up angrily. by what right you dared send me those letters who asked you to try to persuade me to marry him why do you force yourself upon us in this way how could you spare any love for him when you love your own vanity to such an extent why could you not simply go away from here instead of writing me those absurd letters why do you not now marry that generous man who loves you and has done you the honour of offering you his hand you will be receiving too much honour. it was strange nastasia philipovna felt to see aglaya like this. she gazed at her and could hardly believe her eyes and ears for a moment or two. the prince realized this and great suffering expressed itself in his face. aglaya observed it and trembled with anger. and i imagined her an angel of course you were afraid of me or you would not have decided to come. do you know why you are afraid of me and what is your object now i am not worthy of him i know. but i think you are lying all the same. he cannot hate me and he cannot have said so. i am ready to forgive you in consideration of your position but i confess i thought better of you. i thought you were wiser and more beautiful too i did indeed well take your treasure see he is gazing at you he cant recollect himself. shall i he will stay and he will marry me too and you shall trot home all alone. shall i aglaya had made for the door in terror but she stopped at the threshold and listened. ha ha you thought i would marry him for your benefit did you why ill call out now if you like in your presence rogojin get out and say to the prince do you remember what you promised me heavens i only ran away from you in order to set you free and now i dont care to let you go again. i am not a loose woman ask rogojin there hell tell you. and if he does not approach me at once and take me and throw you over then have him for your own i give him up to you she could not hold out long enough even to witness his movement in her direction. the prince made a rush after her but he was caught and held back. she opened her eyes but for a moment she understood nothing. suddenly she looked around shuddered gave a loud cry and threw herself in the princes arms. why why did i mad mad get away rogojin he laughed when she laughed and was ready to cry when she cried. such a statement on our part may appear strange to the reader. how is anyone to tell a story which he cannot understand himself in order to keep clear of a false position we had perhaps better give an example of what we mean and probably the intelligent reader will soon understand the difficulty. of course much was said that could not be determined absolutely. what did he think of all this time then what did he wish for however let us take one more example. he would listen to her for hours at a time with a quiet smile on his face scarcely saying a word himself. on leaving nastasias aglaya had felt that she would rather die than face her people and had therefore gone straight to nina alexandrovnas. hippolyte told the prince this last story sending for him on purpose. when muishkin heard about the candle and ganias finger he had laughed so that he had quite astonished hippolyte and then shuddered and burst into tears. we may remark here that not only the epanchins themselves but all who had anything to do with them thought it right to break with the prince in consequence of his conduct. prince s. even went so far as to turn away and cut him dead in the street. evgenie called upon the prince the day after that on which the epanchins left pavlofsk. the prince did not know up to this that the epanchins had left the place. lizabetha prokofievna had insisted that it was quite impossible to remain in pavlofsk after what had happened. of course of course i know it was all so unexpected. i admit that you only naturally lost your head and and could not stop the foolish girl that was not in your power. i quite see so much but you really should have understood how seriously she cared for you. ill show you yourself as in a lookingglass if you like. oh heavens the question is was there any reality and truth in your feelings what do you think yourself is that what you wished to say my good fellow can you be an honest man prince if you act so i ask you oh where was your heart i should like to know your christian heart all that time did she look as though she were suffering less at that moment you saw her face was she suffering less than the other woman how could you see her suffering and allow it to continue to this moment i dont know how it all happened. she would have died she would have killed herself. you dont know her and i should have told aglaya everything afterwards but i see evgenie pavlovitch you dont know all. tell me now why am i not allowed to see aglaya i should have cleared it all up you know. neither of them kept to the real point you see. i could never explain what i mean to you but i think i could to aglaya. oh my god my god you spoke just now of aglayas face at the moment when she ran away. oh my god i remember it you are going to be married are you not you are talking nonsense my friend. you are marrying the woman you love in order to secure her happiness and aglaya sees and knows it. oh no i am only marrying her well because she wished it. it means nothing its all the same. she would certainly have died. i understand all now that i did not understand before and do you know when those two stood opposite to one another i could not bear nastasia philipovnas face i mean her face i looked at her face you see. even in the morning when i saw her portrait i felt that i could not bear to look at it. now theres vera lebedeff for instance her eyes are quite different you know. i cant make head or tail of it prince. why she is a child shes a child now a real child. oh i shall die in my sleep very soon i thought i was dying in my sleep last night. oh if aglaya only knew all i mean really really all because she must know all thats the first condition towards understanding. why cannot we ever know all about another especially when that other has been guilty but i dont know what im talking about im so confused. surely surely aglaya has not the same expression now as she had at the moment when she ran away oh yes i am guilty and i know it i know it probably i am in fault all round i dont quite know how but i am in fault no doubt. there is something else but i cannot explain it to you evgenie pavlovitch. i have no words but aglaya will understand. do you know what my poor prince you are very wise evgenie pavlovitch oh he too felt that the prince must be out of his mind. ha ha ha how does the fellow manage to love two of them two different kinds of love i suppose this is very interesting poor idiot the wedding was hurried on. the day was fixed for exactly a week after evgenies visit to the prince. neither their position nor their private inclination perhaps and only naturally would allow them to use any more pronounced means. colia was occupied with his father at this time. the old man died during a second stroke which took place just eight days after the first. the prince showed great sympathy in the grief of the family and during the first days of their mourning he was at the house a great deal with nina alexandrovna. the same thing happened in the park and in the street wherever he went. the funeral service produced a great effect on the prince. he whispered to lebedeff that this was the first time he had ever heard a russian funeral service since he was a little boy. why is he here why they dont even know him anyone can come in you know. why do you look so amazed colia had made it up with the prince before his fathers death and it was he who urged him to make use of keller and burdovsky promising to answer himself for the formers behaviour. the next day keller came to visit the prince. he wants to put you under control. imagine that i have heard it said positively. he only laughed now and forgot the hint at once. he then proceeded to explain his whole game to the prince interesting the latter exceedingly. according to lebedeffs account he had first tried what he could do with general epanchin. lizabetha prokofievna would neither hear nor see him. however lebedeff had not lost heart and went off to a clever lawyer a worthy and respectable man whom he knew well. muishkin remembered the doctors visit quite well. the prince had of course at once received him and had plunged into a conversation about hippolyte. they lived hippolyte and his mother and the children in a small house not far off and the little ones were happy if only because they were able to escape from the invalid into the garden. of course the prince went. rogojin knows how you love her. love for love. you took nastasia philipovna from him. the prince left the house beside himself with terror. nastasia would be wild with joy to see the impression she had made and to hear his laugh of real amusement and she would remain the whole evening in a state of pride and happiness. in his love for her there was the sort of tenderness one feels for a sick unhappy child which cannot be left alone. he never spoke of his feelings for nastasia to anyone not even to herself. she was now quite different from the woman he had known three months before. and he felt sure that so sudden a change could not be a natural one. nor could it arise from dread of the fate that awaited her if she married rogojin. the prince had observed that nastasia knew well enough what aglaya was to him. he never spoke of it but he had seen her face when she had caught him starting off for the epanchins house on several occasions. he did not observe what was happening until they were almost passing the windows when it was too late to do anything. he said nothing but for two days afterwards he was ill.
nastasia did not try that particular experiment again. a few days before that fixed for the wedding she grew grave and thoughtful. it was a most curious circumstance in his opinion that she never spoke of rogojin. but once about five days before the wedding when the prince was at home a messenger arrived begging him to come at once as nastasia philipovna was very ill.
he had found her in a condition approaching to absolute madness. she screamed and trembled and cried out that rogojin was hiding out there in the garden that she had seen him herself and that he would murder her in the night that he would cut her throat. she was terribly agitated all day. but it so happened that the prince called at hippolytes house later on and heard from his mother that she had been in town all day and had there received a visit from rogojin who had made inquiries about pavlofsk. the prince left her at eleven full of these thoughts and went home. but it was not twelve oclock when a messenger came to say that nastasia was very bad and he must come at once. it was some time before she could be made to hear that the prince had come and then she opened the door only just sufficiently to let him in and immediately locked it behind him. she then fell on her knees at his feet. he sent another messenger during the night to inquire after her and two more next morning. the wedding was fixed for eight oclock in the evening. nastasia philipovna was ready at seven. the church began to fill at seven. the prince stayed near the altar while keller made off once more to fetch the bride. nastasia philipovna was ready. it was his look that had caught her eyes. if you catch the train you shall have another. in fact he and burdovsky jumped into another carriage and set off in pursuit but it struck them as they drove along that it was not much use trying to bring nastasia back by force. rogojin and nastasia philipovna reached the station just in time for the train. before the astonished young woman could collect her scattered senses he pushed the money into her hand seized the mantle and threw it and the handkerchief over nastasias head and shoulders. there was much excited talking and shaking of heads even some laughter but no one left the church all being anxious to observe how the now celebrated bridegroom would take the news. he grew very pale upon hearing it but took it quite quietly. he seemed anxious to reach home and be left alone as quickly as possible but this was not to be. the prince offered seats to his strange visitors tea was served and a general conversation sprang up. by degrees the conversation became almost serious. nearly an hour passed thus and when tea was over the visitors seemed to think that it was time to go. we should have shouted and fought and called in the police. but he has simply made some new friends and such friends too colia was the last to go after having helped him to change his wedding clothes. they parted on affectionate terms and without speaking of what had happened colia promised to come very early the next day. he said later that the prince had given no hint of his intentions when they said goodbye but had hidden them even from him. soon there was hardly anyone left in the house. burdovsky had gone to see hippolyte keller and lebedeff had wandered off together somewhere. she approached him and touched his shoulder gently. all he did however was to ask vera very earnestly to knock at his door and awake him in time for the first train to petersburg next morning. vera promised and the prince entreated her not to tell anyone of his intention. she went away in great anxiety about him but when she saw him in the morning he seemed to be quite himself again greeted her with a smile and told her that he would very likely be back by the evening. he had gone to the front door and was kept waiting a long while before anyone came. at last the door of old mrs. rogojins flat was opened and an aged servant appeared. the prince decided to come back within an hour. i cant tell. it was a hot bright day. he waited another minute and decided to go and ring the bell once more however he thought better of it again and put it off for an hour. the chief object in his mind at this moment was to get as quickly as he could to nastasia philipovnas lodging. probably nastasia had kept the rooms when she came down to pavlofsk this last time and most likely she would have spent the night in them rogojin having taken her straight there from the station. the whole family of all ages surrounded him and he was begged to enter. if rogojin was really not at home the prince was advised to go to a certain house the address of which was given where lived a german lady a friend of nastasia philipovnas. it was possible that she might have spent the night there in her anxiety to conceal herself. after a moments thought he gave the address of the small hotel on the stairs of which he had had a fit some five weeks since. he then set off once more for rogojins. this time they neither opened the door at rogojins flat nor at the one opposite. eventually however he was persuaded to reply so far as to state that rogojin had left the house early in the morning and gone to pavlofsk and that he would not return today at all. however the prince decided to call again in a couple of hours and after that to watch the house in case of need. his hope was that he might yet find nastasia at the address which he had just received. to that address he now set off at full speed. but alas at the german ladys house they did not even appear to understand what he wanted. after a while by means of certain hints he was able to gather that nastasia must have had a quarrel with her friend two or three weeks ago since which date the latter had neither heard nor seen anything of her. so muishkin took his leave hurriedly. it struck him now that she might have gone away to moscow just as she had done the last time and that rogojin had perhaps gone after her or even with her. if only he could find some trace however he must take his room at the hotel and he started off in that direction. rogojin had not returned and no one came to the door. he was expected there. the mother had already been to three or four places to look for nastasia but had not found a trace of any kind. the prince said nothing but entered the room sat down silently and stared at them one after the other with the air of a man who cannot understand what is being said to him. at length he rose from his seat and begged to be shown nastasias rooms. nastasia had laughed but soon they began playing. the prince asked where were the cards but was told that rogojin used to bring a new pack every day and always carried it away in his pocket. the prince was to come back at ten oclock and meet her to hear her news and arrange plans for the morrow. heaven knows how long and upon what subjects he thought. he shuddered as a sudden idea struck him. this idea was that if rogojin were in petersburg though he might hide for a time yet he was quite sure to come to him the prince before long with either good or evil intentions but probably with the same intention as on that other occasion. at all events if rogojin were to come at all he would be sure to seek the prince here he had no other town address perhaps in this same corridor he might well seek him here if he needed him. and perhaps he did need him. this idea seemed quite natural to the prince though he could not have explained why he should so suddenly have become necessary to rogojin. rogojin would not come if all were well with him that was part of the thought he would come if all were not well and certainly undoubtedly all would not be well with him. the prince could not bear this new idea he took his hat and rushed out towards the street. it was almost dark in the passage. but no one came out. the prince immediately began to tell him eagerly and joyfully how he had but the moment before expected to see him in the dark passage of the hotel. having thought it over he glanced at rogojin in alarm. the prince supposed that rogojin desired to look out for someone whom he was afraid to miss but if so why had he not told him whom to look out for so the two proceeded for half a mile or so. suddenly the prince began to tremble from some unknown cause. the latter came at once. besides this his heart was beating so that he found it difficult to speak at all. it was about ten oclock. he went over to the doorway. he had spoken in a whisper all the way. i had told her before that if anyone came and rang especially you and i gave her your name she was not to tell about me. so i came to this very window looked out and there you were staring straight at me. even while he told the story of how he had peeped through the blind he gave the impression of wishing to say something else. they entered the study. in this room some changes had taken place since the prince last saw it. the heavy curtain was drawn now and it was very dark. rogojins face was white as usual. his glittering eyes watched the prince with an intent stare. he himself took a chair opposite and drew it up so close that he almost pressed against the princes knees. at their side was a little round table. rogojin rose also. rogojin looked intently at him again as before. muishkin went in. the prince took a step forward then another and paused. he stood and stared for a minute or two. but now his eyes had become so far accustomed to the darkness that he could distinguish the whole of the bed. someone was asleep upon it in an absolutely motionless sleep. the prince shuddered. neither spoke for five minutes. they would all come and knock and want to come in because they know i am not at home. i didnt light a candle for the same reason. i told them that she had called in for ten minutes and then gone straight back to pavlofsk. no one knows she slept here. last night we came in just as carefully as you and i did today. i thought as i came along with her that she would not like to creep in so secretly but i was quite wrong. she was mad with terror in the train and she begged me to bring her to this house. she said no not there hell find me out at once there. you shudder and tremble so. well pass the night here together. there are no other beds besides that one but ive thought how well manage. for if they come in and look about now you know theyll find her and carry her away and theyll be asking me questions and i shall say i did it and then theyll take me away too dont you see so let her lie close to us close to you and me. i have only been out of the house one hour all day all the rest of the time i have been with her. i dare say the air is very bad here. it is so hot. and shes lying so still you shall see in the morning when its light. what he then approached the prince and gently helped him to rise and led him towards the bed. but the prince could now walk by himself so that his fear must have passed for all that however he continued to shudder. there was a long silence. he pulled out a pack of cards wrapped in a bit of paper from his pocket and handed them to the prince. the latter took them with a sort of perplexity. the prince sat down on a chair and watched him in alarm. half an hour went by. that young officer dont you remember that fellow at the band eh ha ha ha rogojin never turned his head and seemed to have forgotten all about him. the prince watched and waited. time went on it began to grow light. his legs trembled again and he seemed to have lost the use of them. meanwhile the daylight grew full and strong and at last the prince lay down as though overcome by despair and laid his face against the white motionless face of rogojin. his tears flowed on to rogojins cheek though he was perhaps not aware of them himself. but alas he understood nothing of what was said to him and recognized none of those who surrounded him. he declared that he had seen rogojin return to the house last night accompanied by a friend and that both had gone upstairs very secretly and cautiously. after this there was no hesitation about breaking open the door since it could not be got open in any other way. rogojin suffered from brain fever for two months. when he recovered from the attack he was at once brought up on trial for murder. he gave full satisfactory and direct evidence on every point and the princes name was thanks to this not brought into the proceedings. rogojin was very quiet during the progress of the trial. lebedeff keller gania ptitsin and many other friends of ours continue to live as before. hippolyte died in great agitation and rather sooner than he expected about a fortnight after nastasia philipovnas death. colia was much affected by these events and drew nearer to his mother in heart and sympathy. he was not far wrong in his choice. we have never been able to discover clearly how such relations sprang up. prince s. had made a few just and sensible remarks. there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face on the throne of england there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face on the throne of france. ii. whenever the leader made this rattle the passenger started as a nervous passenger might and was disturbed in mind. they had stopped when the coach stopped and they kept close company with it. the last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. he remained on the step half in the coach and half out of they remained in the road below him. they all looked from the coachman to the guard and from the guard to the coachman and listened. the sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill. stand for im a devil at a quick mistake and when i make one it takes the form of lead. i belong to tellsons bank. you must know tellsons bank in london. i am going to paris on business. a crown to drink. its not long you see guard. make the best of your way. thats a blazing strange message. much of that wouldnt do for you jerry i say jerry it was appointed that the book should shut with a spring for ever and for ever when i had read but a page. it was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost when the light was playing on its surface and i stood in ignorance on the shore. recalled  tellsons bank had a run upon it in the mail. he was on his way to dig some one out of a grave. the passenger would then start to himself and lower the window to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek. he lowered the window and looked out at the rising sun. the tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon sir. yes sir. that way sir if you please. she may ask for mr. jarvis lorry or she may only ask for a gentleman from tellsons bank. that was before my time here sir. before our peoples time here sir. the beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about and the sea did what it liked and what it liked was destruction. as if they had any help for anybody in their absurd baskets he made her another bow. i had the honour of knowing him there. i was at that time in our french house and had been oh his affairs like the affairs of many other french gentlemen and french families were entirely in tellsons hands. feelings i have no time for them no chance of them. now comes the difference. if your father had not died when he did dont be frightened i am going to. regard it as a matter of business business that must be done. courage business you have business before you useful business. miss manette your mother took this course with you. he is alive. still alive. see now see now the best and the worst are known to you now. it would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries because it would be dangerous. better not to mention the subject anywhere or in any way and to remove him for a while at all events out of france. this is a secret service altogether. but what is the matter she doesnt notice a word i am not so much to look at am i why dont you go and fetch things look at her with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. it had stained many hands too and many faces and many naked feet and many wooden shoes. it missed its mark and completely failed as is often the way with his tribe too. madame defarge his wife sat in the shop behind the counter as he came in. so much the worse a bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths and hard lives they live jacques. but now that i remember one of you has already been there and can show the way. it had not lasted a minute when he nodded and went out. mr. lorrys spirits grew heavier and heavier as he and his two companions ascended higher and higher. at last the top of the staircase was gained and they stopped for the third time. and a beautiful world we live in when it is possible and when many other such things are possible and not only possible but done done see you under that sky there every day. long live the devil. courage business then all the good you bring to him all the relief all the happiness you bring to him begin. let our good friend here assist you on that side. thats well friend defarge. come now. the staircase was short and they were soon at the top. on hearing footsteps close at hand these three turned and rose and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wineshop. enough you are english that is another thing. soon raising his head again he struck twice or thrice upon the door evidently with no other object than to make a noise there. a faint voice answered something. he sat her down just within the door and held her clinging to him. defarge drew out the key closed the door locked it on the inside took out the key again and held it in his hand. he stopped there and faced round. his few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench. his yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat and showed his body to be withered and worn. he had put up a hand between his eyes and the light and the very bones of it seemed transparent. i suppose so. mr. lorry came silently forward leaving the daughter by the door. when he had stood for a minute or two by the side of defarge the shoemaker looked up. the look and the action had occupied but an instant. show him that shoe you are working at. no i was not a shoemaker by trade. i taught myself. look at him. look at me. darkness had fallen on him in its place. finally with a deep long sigh he took the shoe up and resumed his work. hush let us draw further back. not a word was spoken not a sound was made. she stood like a spirit beside him and he bent over his work. it happened at length that he had occasion to change the instrument in his hand for his shoemakers knife. it lay on that side of him which was not the side on which she stood. he raised them and saw her face. she had no fear of his striking at her with the knife though they had. he stared at her with a fearful look and after a while his lips began to form some words though no sound proceeded from them. her golden hair which she wore in long curls had been hurriedly pushed aside and fell down over her neck. advancing his hand by little and little he took it up and looked at it. but not for long. he took her hair into his hand again and looked closely at it. how can it be when was it he turned her full to the light and looked at her. they can never help me to escape in the body though they may in the spirit. those were the words i said. it cant be. see what the prisoner is. these are not the hands she knew this is not the face she knew this is not a voice she ever heard. no no. she was and he was before the slow years of the north tower ages ago. but i cannot tell you at this time and i cannot tell you here. all that i may tell you here and now is that i pray to you to touch me and to bless me. kiss me kiss me weep for her then and for me good gentlemen thank god o see you see how composed he has become and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me now. why should you be then as the darkness closed in the daughter laid her head down on the hard ground close at the fathers side and watched him. they began to descend monsieur defarge going first with the lamp mr.
lorry closing the little procession. no i dont remember. when they took a young man into tellsons london house they hid him somewhere till he was old. youre a nice woman and if you were i wont be took the liberty with. here i cant afford it. yes youre religious too. mr. crunchers temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast. what are you up to he wishes to have a messenger at hand. take care of your chest and voice my good friend and leave the law to take care of itself. some of us have damp ways and some of us have dry ways. here is the letter. it had more than once happened that the judge in the black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as the prisoners and even died before him. all the human breath in the place rolled at him like a sea or a wind or a fire. his condition was that of a young gentleman. silence in the court over the prisoners head there was a mirror to throw the light down upon him. be that as it may a change in his position making him conscious of a bar of light across his face he looked up and when he saw the glass his face flushed and his right hand pushed the herbs away. it happened that the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left. about on a level with his eyes there sat in that corner of the judges bench two persons upon whom his look immediately rested so immediately and so much to the changing of his aspect that all the eyes that were turned upon him turned to them. when this expression was upon him he looked as if he were old but when it was stirred and broken up as it was now in a moment on his speaking to his daughter he became a handsome man not past the prime of life. his daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm as she sat by him and the other pressed upon it. she had drawn close to him in her dread of the scene and in her pity for the prisoner. iii. that he called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise. had he ever been a spy himself what did he live upon his property. where was his property he didnt precisely remember where it was. what was it no business of anybodys. yes he had. from whom distant relation. very distant rather. ever been in prison certainly not. didnt see what that had to do with it. come once again. never yes. how many times two or three times. not five or six perhaps. of what profession gentleman. ever been kicked might have been. frequently no. ever kicked downstairs decidedly not once received a kick on the top of a staircase and fell downstairs of his own accord. swear it was not true positively. never. ever live by play not more than other gentlemen do. yes. ever pay him no. no. certain. no. no. expect to get anything by this evidence no. oh dear no. or to do anything oh dear no. swear that over and over again. none whatever. he had taken service with the prisoner in good faith and simplicity four years ago. he had not put them there first. he loved his country and couldnt bear it and had given information. lorry look upon the prisoner. lorry look again upon the prisoner. lorry look once more upon the prisoner. a gentleman and lady. her father rose with her and kept her hand drawn through his arm. my father was so reduced that i was afraid to take him out of the air and i had made a bed for him on the deck near the cabin steps and i sat on the deck at his side to take care of him. there were no other passengers that night but we four. the prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how i could shelter my father from the wind and weather better than i had done. he did it for me. who was called accordingly. a singular circumstance then arose in the case. opening this piece of paper in the next pause the counsel looked with great attention and curiosity at the prisoner. how say you my lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside his wig and giving no very gracious consent the likeness became much more remarkable. mr. carton who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court changed neither his place nor his attitude even in this excitement. look to that young lady. help the gentleman to take her out. the trial had lasted all day and the lamps in the court were now being lighted. but keep in the way. you will be sure to hear when the jury come in. mr. carton came up at the moment and touched mr. lorry on the arm. she will do very well. its a fight to get back again. iv. not absolutely always for she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed but they were few and slight and she believed them over. you have been present all day and you ought to know. with this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away. he slowly shook the shadow off and turned to her. walking between her father and mr. darnay lucie manette passed into the open air. he now stepped up to where mr. lorry and mr. darnay stood upon the pavement. mr. darnay good night god bless you sir i hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy life. it has no good in it for me except wine like this nor i for it. so we are not much alike in that particular. how does it feel there is nothing in you to like you know that. what a change you have made in yourself a good reason for taking to a man that he shows you what you have fallen away from and what you might have been come on and have it out in plain words i remember. how did you come by it the same sydney with the same luck. at this he laughed again and they both laughed. its a gloomy thing however to talk about ones own past with the day breaking. a moment and it was gone. climbing to a high chamber in a well of houses he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed and its pillow was wet with wasted tears. surely not. its a dreadful remembrance. besides that his loss of himself grew out of it. not knowing how he lost himself or how he recovered himself he may never feel certain of not losing himself again. better leave it alone. in short must leave it alone like or no like. sometimes he gets up in the dead of the night and will be heard by us overhead there walking up and down walking up and down in his room. however father and daughter did at last appear and miss pross was ready at the street door to receive them. still the hundreds of people did not present themselves. doctor manette received him kindly and so did lucie. the resemblance between him and lucie was very strong at such times and as they sat side by side she leaning on his shoulder and he resting his arm on the back of her chair it was very agreeable to trace the likeness. his manner and his look quite terrified them all. he recovered himself so quickly however that mr. lorry had doubts of his business eye. lucie sat by her father darnay sat beside her carton leaned against a window. they spoke low as people watching and waiting mostly do as people in a dark room watching and waiting for lightning always do. perhaps see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar bearing down upon them too. yes. but the comfort was that all the company at the grand hotel of monseigneur were perfectly dressed. everybody was dressed for a fancy ball that was never to leave off. its owner went downstairs into the courtyard got into his carriage and drove away. neither did the people say anything after the first cry they had been silent and they remained so. monsieur the marquis ran his eyes over them all as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes. he took out his purse. one or the other of you is for ever in the way. how do i know what injury you have done my horses. see on seeing him the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder sobbing and crying and pointing to the fountain where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle and moving gently about it. they were as silent however as the men. it has died in a moment without pain. among the men not one. but the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily and looked the marquis in the face. the water of the fountain ran the swift river ran the day ran into evening so much life in the city ran into death according to rule time and tide waited for no man the rats were sleeping close together in their dark holes again the fancy ball was lighted up at supper all things ran their course. it had its poor people too. few children were to be seen and no dogs. the fellow was brought cap in hand and the other fellows closed round to look and listen in the manner of the people at the paris fountain. all his fellows stooped to look under the carriage. how do you call the man you know all the men of this part of the country. he was not of this part of the country. what is it for the love of the great god always the same with you people. he is quiet. monseigneur they are so many they increase so fast there is so much want. monseigneur it is not probable he will arrive tonight nevertheless leave the table as it is. he was half way through it when he again stopped with his glass in his hand hearing the sound of wheels. he was to be told said monseigneur that supper awaited him then and there and that he was prayed to come to it. in a little while he came. he had been known in england as charles darnay. so long as a servant was present no other words passed between them. it used not to be so but france in all such things is changed for the worse. why need i speak of my fathers time when it is equally yours france may be but is the property the family honour sir is safe from me in this country. yes. the nephew looked at him in vain in passing on to the door. good repose light monsieur my nephew to his chamber there now the sun was full up and movement began in the village. it lay back on the pillow of monsieur the marquis. driven home into the heart of the stone figure attached to it was a knife. he had expected labour and he found it and did it and made the best of it. the rest of his time he passed in london. he had loved lucie manette from the hour of his danger. that he had his reasons for this he knew full well. it was the close of the summer day and he knew lucie to be out with miss pross. to him now entered charles darnay at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand. i rejoice to see you. we have been counting on your return these three or four days past. if ever there were love in the world i love her. let that be the latter so received it and remained silent. i know that when she is clinging to you the hands of baby girl and woman all in one are round your neck. i have felt and do even now feel that to bring my love even mine between you is to touch your history with something not quite so good as itself. but i love her. mr. stryver is here too occasionally. you want a promise from me. i say nothing more of my stake in this this is what i ask. she is everything to me more to me than suffering more to me than wrong more to me well my present name though but slightly changed from my mothers is not as you will remember my own. she will be home directly and it is better she should not see us together tonight. go the noise ceased at the sound of her voice and he presently came out to her and they walked up and down together for a long time. she came down from her bed to look at him in his sleep that night. and not for money. youve been at doctor manettes house as much as i have or more than i have. and look at me the young lady is miss manette. yes sydney i have had enough of this style of life with no other as a change from it i feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels inclined to go to it when he doesnt he can stay away and i feel that miss manette will tell well in any station and will always do me credit. so i have made up my mind. you are in a bad way you know you really are in a bad way. i have looked it in the face in my different way look it in the face you in your different way. marry. provide somebody to take care of you. find out somebody. thats the kind of thing for you. yes. state your reason. but as an old fellow who has carried miss manette in his arms who is the trusted friend of miss manette and of her father too and who has a great affection for them both i have spoken. the confidence is not of my seeking recollect. thank you. you know the terms upon which i have the honour and happiness to stand with the family. it is only a question of a few hours. there is no harm at all done. i have not proposed to the young lady and between ourselves i am by no means certain on reflection that i ever should have committed myself to that extent. now pray say no more about it. i tell you i regret it on account of others but i am satisfied on my own account. the fellow of no delicacy 
if sydney carton ever shone anywhere he certainly never shone in the house of doctor manette. i shall never be better than i am. the table trembled in the silence that followed. she had never seen him softened and was much distressed. i break down before the knowledge of what i want to say to you. i am like one who died young. can i not recall you forgive me again to a better course no miss manette to none. if you will hear me through a very little more all you can ever do for me is done. i wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul. o mr. carton think again i have proved myself and i know better. i distress you i draw fast to an end. be comforted for you and for any dear to you i would do anything. dont let me hear no more of you or you shall feel some more of me. have em out there pull em out there the place had a soothing influence on him. you may as well go again me one way as another. it is yes jerry. thats about it. i think so. im a going as your mother knows a fishing. thats where im going to. when you go to rome do as rome does. under cover of the darkness he followed out of the room followed down the stairs followed down the court followed out into the streets. in the shadow of bank and wall the three turned out of the road and up a blind lane of which the wall there risen to some eight or ten feet high formed one side. he was soon over and then the second fisherman got over and then the third. they all dropped softly on the ground within the gate and lay there a little listening perhaps. then they moved away on their hands and knees. it was now young jerrys turn to approach the gate which he did holding his breath. they did not creep far before they stopped and stood upright. and then they began to fish. whatever tools they worked with they worked hard until the awful striking of the church clock so terrified young jerry that he made off with his hair as stiff as his fathers. by slow degrees the weight broke away the earth upon it and came to the surface. call yourself a religious woman after taking a timid peep at him lying on his back with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow his son lay down too and fell asleep again. there was no fish for breakfast and not much of anything else. knitting 
there had been earlier drinking than usual in the wineshop of monsieur defarge. monsieur defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time. yet no one had followed them and no man spoke when they entered the wineshop though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them. upon which every man looked at his neighbour and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent. except one man who got up and went out. i met him by accident a day and halfs journey out of paris. a third man got up and went out. he looked at no one present and no one now looked at him not even madame defarge who had taken up her knitting and was at work. he will tell you all. behold the manner of it. jacques one struck in and asked if he had ever seen the man before jacques three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then observe bring that rascal and they bring him faster. i follow. they laugh and pick him up again. what do i know it is possible. that old man says all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late king louis fifteen. but how do i know if he lies some whisper this some whisper that they speak of nothing else even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. at length on sunday night when all the village is asleep come soldiers winding down from the prison and their guns ring on the stones of the little street. soldiers have marched into the prison in the night and he is in the midst of many soldiers. how can the women and the children draw water who can gossip of an evening under that shadow under it have i said i left at sunset as i had been warned to do and i walked on that night and half next day until i met as i was warned i should this comrade. with him i came on now riding and now walking through the rest of yesterday and through last night. the three had risen and their heads were together when he came back to the garret. i hope so. i charge myself with him let him remain with me i will take care of him and set him on his road. saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted his life was very new and agreeable. say say eh well in the meantime it is always preparing though it is not seen or heard. i tell thee it is always advancing. can such things last i believe with all my soul that we shall see the triumph. perhaps they thought as much at court that sunny summer day. a figure entering at the door threw a shadow on madame defarge which she felt to be a new one. it was curious. the visitor watched her fingers for a few moments and took the opportunity of observing the place in general. i may find a use for it one day. nor of those who had been there when this visitor entered was there one left. they had all dropped off. all we think here is how to live. i think for others ah that is not my name. when doctor manette was released you his old domestic had the charge of him i know. he was delivered to you. it was cruel cruel but he lives unknown in england he is no marquis there he is mr. charles darnay. the spy would have been no spy if he had failed to see it or to record it in his mind. for some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of saint antoine the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them lest he should come back. but as the fingers went the eyes went and the thoughts. lucie was to be married tomorrow. when it was yet light enough to work and read she had neither engaged herself in her usual work nor had she read to him. she had employed herself in both ways at his side under the tree many and many a time but this time was not quite like any other and nothing could make it so. i am deeply happy in the love that heaven has so blessed my love for charles and charless love for me. in the sad moonlight she clasped him by the neck and laid her face upon his breast. in the moonlight which is always sad as the light of the sun itself is as the light called human life is at its coming and its going. i know it well but do you know it indeed it is so. consider how natural and how plain it is my dear that it should be so. if it had not been charles it would have been another. it gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears and she remembered it long afterwards. whether it was alive. whether it had been born alive or the poor mothers shock had killed it. i have cast up the years of her age year after year. i have seen her married to a man who knew nothing of my fate. that was another thing. it stood before my disturbed sense of sight but it never moved. the other had that likeness too as you have but was not the same. can you follow me lucie hardly i think my picture was in her room and i was in her prayers. she could never deliver me i imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things. doctor manette was very cheerful at the little supper. they were only three at table and miss pross made the third. so the time came for him to bid lucie good night and they separated. lord bless me how little i thought what i was doing such a present of plate as you have made em is enough to bring tears into anybodys eyes. dear me dear dear dear enough now i hear somebodys step coming to the door. the door of the doctors room opened and he came out with charles darnay. they returned home to breakfast and all went well and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemakers white locks in the paris garret were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight on the threshold of the door at parting. it was a hard parting though it was not for long. the corner being out of the way of the idle and curious and the preparations having been very simple and few the doctor mr. lorry and miss pross were left quite alone. i must look in at tellsons so i will go there at once and come back presently. when he came back he ascended the old staircase alone having asked no question of the servant going thus into the doctors rooms he was stopped by a low sound of knocking. the bench was turned towards the light as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before and his head was bent down and he was very busy. he worked hard impatiently as if in some sense of having been interrupted. mr. lorry glanced at the work in his hand and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape. he took up another that was lying by him and asked what it was. think again. two things at once impressed themselves on mr. lorry as important above all others the first that this must be kept secret from lucie the second that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. he therefore made arrangements to absent himself from tellsons for the first time in his life and took his post by the window in the same room. doctor manette took what was given him to eat and drink and worked on that first day until it was too dark to see worked on half an hour after mr. lorry could not have seen for his life to read or write. the third day came and went the fourth the fifth. five days six days seven days eight days nine days. an opinion 
worn out by anxious watching mr. lorry fell asleep at his post. for going to the door of the doctors room and looking in he perceived that the shoemakers bench and tools were put aside again and that the doctor himself sat reading at the window. it was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment the answer being obvious. within a few minutes miss pross stood whispering at his side. the doctor was summoned in the usual way and came to breakfast. and that aid was his own. he had already glanced at his hands more than once. the mind. it has been kept from her and i hope will always be kept from her. is there danger of another how does it come about at all what can i do for my friend but it is as i have told you next to impossible. as it pleased heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon i should have great hope. thats good comfort. he felt it to be the most difficult of all but remembering his old sunday morning conversation with miss pross and remembering what he had seen in the last nine days he knew that he must face it. if the thing were gone my dear manette might not the fear go with it i only want your authority. i am sure it does no good. come give me your authority like a dear good man. but i would not take it away while he was present. they passed the day in the country and the doctor was quite restored. they had not been at home many hours when he presented himself. he watched his opportunity of taking darnay aside into a window and of speaking to him when no one overheard. however let me try. the curse of those occasions is heavy upon me for i always remember them. i hope it may be taken into account one day when all days are at an end for me i had no other object than to turn a slight thing which to my surprise seems to trouble you too much aside. mind i have gone aside from my purpose i was speaking about our being friends. well i thank you darnay. he spoke of him in short not bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him but as anybody might who saw him as he showed himself. he had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young wife but when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms he found her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly marked. fluttering hopes and doubts hopes of a love as yet unknown to her
doubts of her remaining upon earth to enjoy that new delight divided her breast. that time passed and her little lucie lay on her bosom. her husbands step was strong and prosperous among them her fathers firm and equal. they see my fathers face. o father blessed words and one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages. the little boy had spoken of him almost at the last. and it was now about little lucies sixth birthday that they began to have an awful sound as of a great storm in france with a dreadful sea rising. it was a hot wild night and they were all three reminded of the old sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place. we have been so full of business all day that we have not known what to do first or which way to turn. yes but we dont know what reason there is in it. i dont know why anything should be otherwise than safe and well here thank god but i have been so put out all day and i am not as young as i was my tea my dear thank ye. there was a stool and table and a straw bed. the man obeyed and defarge followed the light closely with his eyes. what is that in your hand and see so but they have found him alive hiding in the country and have brought him in. i have said that he had reason to fear us. say all a moment of profound silence followed. the vengeance stooped and the jar of a drum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter. o heaven our suffering nevertheless not a moment was lost not a moment no. that was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back. ha ha that was well done. the drums was the only voice in saint antoine that blood and hurry had not changed. but this was not the change on the village and on many a village like it. no. they again joined hands. i have walked two nights without resting. let me finish my pipe and i shall sleep like a child. he was fast asleep directly. when the village had taken its poor supper it did not creep to bed as it usually did but came out of doors again and remained there. four lights broke out there and moved away in different directions and all was black again. but not for long. soon from a score of the great windows flames burst forth and the stone faces awakened stared out of fire. at the gate a group of officers were looking at the fire removed from them a group of soldiers. it was within half an hour or so of the time of closing. i wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of lucie nonsense sir i intend to take jerry. the house laid the letter down so close to darnay that he saw the direction the more quickly because it was his own right name. nobody else knew it to be his name his own wife had no suspicion of the fact mr. lorry could have none. is that the sort of fellow i am sorry to hear you putting any such extraordinary questions. well but ill answer you. if this fellow is a gentleman i dont understand him. mr. lorry and charles darnay were left alone at the desk in the general departure from the bank. on the road i have suffered a great deal. i cry in my sleep where is he i demand of heaven will he not come to deliver me no answer. my fault is that i have been true to you. yes. his resolution was made. he must go to paris. yes. he knew of no rock he saw hardly any danger. as he walked to and fro with his resolution made he considered that neither lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone. but that circumstance too had had its influence in his course. he walked to and fro with thoughts very busy until it was time to return to tellsons and take leave of mr. lorry. as soon as he arrived in paris he would present himself to this old friend but he must say nothing of his intention now. the end of the second book. he had been days upon his journey in france alone when he went to bed tired out in a little town on the high road still a long way from paris. here he paid a heavy price for his escort and hence he started with it on the wet wet roads at three oclock in the morning. it is all the same. daylight at last found them before the wall of paris. i demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay. according to its nature. but what then my duty is to my country and the people. as they walked on in silence he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets. the very children scarcely noticed him. with this on his mind which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard he arrived at the prison of la force. ghosts all it struck him motionless. surely ghosts all. we so much regret it it struck cold and damp but was not dark. you will be visited and can ask then.     he made shoes he made shoes he made shoes. ii. yet such things were. yet a french tellsons could get on with these things exceedingly well and as long as the times held together no man had taken fright at them and drawn out his money. all such circumstances were indifferent to him so that he did his duty. it was well guarded and he got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it when his door suddenly opened and two figures rushed in at sight of which he fell back in amazement. lucie and her father lucie manette what has happened what has brought you here almost at the same moment the bell of the great gate rang again and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard. i have been a bastille prisoner. i knew it would be so i knew i could help charles out of all danger i told lucie so. i solemnly swear to you that i know of no harm having happened to charles that i had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place. there is no help for you in any action on your part tonight you cannot possibly stir out. you must let me put you in a room at the back here. i see in your face that you know i can do nothing else than this. if you are sure of what you say if you really have the power you think you have as i believe you have make yourself known to these devils and get taken to la force. room for the bastille prisoner in front there he found her child and miss pross with her but it never occurred to him to be surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards when he sat watching them in such quiet as the night knew. miss pross had laid the child down on his own bed and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge. iii. to this lodging he at once removed lucie and her child and miss pross
giving them what comfort he could and much more than he had himself. it wore itself out and wore him out with it until the bank closed. there they found two women one knitting. both the women followed the second woman being the vengeance. i am well and your father has       influence around me. you cannot answer this. she stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom and with her hands yet at her neck looked terrified at madame defarge. you will do him no harm. for my childs sake the vengeance followed. defarge went last and closed the door. so far all goes well with us much much better than it has of late gone with many poor souls. a shadow indeed iv. calm in storm 
doctor manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his absence. but he had never seen his friend in his present aspect he had never at all known him in his present character. for the first time the doctor felt now that his suffering was strength and power. hold of it was lost in the raging fever of a nation as it is in the fever of one patient. no man better known than he in paris at that day no man in a stranger situation. he was not suspected or brought in question any more than if he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before or were a spirit moving among mortals. but from the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in the garret of saint antoine she had been true to her duties. everything had its appointed place and its appointed time. it was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. on the third day of her being there he noticed her. a child too but its not my business. my work is my business. see my saw la la la la la la see here again and off her head comes now a child. and off its head comes. her husband saw her so she learned from her father it might be once in five or six times it might be twice or thrice running it might be not for a week or a fortnight together. it was a day of some wild rejoicing and a festival. his shop was shut and he was not there which was a relief to lucie and left her quite alone. but he was not far off for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along which filled her with fear. there was no other music than their own singing. no fight could have been half so terrible as this dance. i have seen it many times. dont be frightened i left him climbing to the window and i came to tell you. there is no one here to see. madame defarge. nothing more. madame defarge gone like a shadow over the white road. they both knew too well what it meant. one. two. three. no better man living to hold fast by what tellsons had in keeping and to hold his peace. it was almost dark when they arrived at the bank. above a heap of dust and ashes in the court ran the letters
national property. there were hurried words of farewell and kindness but the parting was soon over. next day fifteen prisoners were put to the bar before charles darnays name was called. among these last was one with a spare piece of knitting under her arm as she worked. under the president sat doctor manette in his usual quiet dress. undoubtedly it was. what did he call himself why not the president desired to know. what proof had he of this but he had married in england the president reminded him. true but not an english woman. yes. by birth. her name and family the president asked why had he returned to france when he did and not sooner the president required the name of that citizen. the accused explained that the citizen was his first witness. the doctor had taken care that it should be there had assured him that it would be there and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read. all the voices were in the prisoners favour and the president declared him free. they put him into a great chair they had among them and which they had taken either out of the court itself or one of its rooms or passages. over the chair they had thrown a red flag and to the back of it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top. my own and yet his wife trembled and a vague but heavy fear was upon her. her mind pursued them looking for him among the condemned and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more. let them all lean upon him. she always made a bargain for it by holding up as a statement of its just price one finger less than the merchant held up whatever his number might be. we want wine among the rest. take care of the dear husband you have recovered and dont move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now till you see me again we must hold up our heads and fight low as my brother solomon used to say. now mr. cruncher what can this be hide charles. what weakness is this my dear we seek him. the republic goes before all. truly it is against rule. mr. cruncher with the basket walked at her side. in going he had to face miss pross. no sooner did he face her than miss pross uttered a scream and clapped her hands. in a moment the whole company were on their feet. but they had no ears for anything in their surprise. pay for your wine and come out. i am busy. you want to be the death of me. might i ask the favour she calls you solomon and she must know being your sister. and i know youre john you know. which of the two goes first and regarding that name of pross likewise. i know you. i arrived at mr. lorrys to his surprise yesterday evening we agreed that i would not present myself elsewhere until all was well or unless i could be useful i present myself here to beg a little talk with your brother. you have a face to be remembered and i remember faces well. i walked into the wineshop here close after you and sat near you. but for my great respect for your sister i might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that i wish to make for our mutual satisfaction. let me take your arm miss pross. are we ready they left her at the corner of the street and carton led the way to mr.
lorrys which was within a few minutes walk. he turned his head as they entered and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger. i pass to worse news. but it may not be so. any one carried home by the people today may be condemned tomorrow. thats a very good card. thats an excellent card. thats a card not to be beaten. no. i am sure not. spoke good french. i attended him in his last illness. there it is. oh look at it look at it no not he it was a take in. and look here you told me you had a proposal what is it now it is of no use asking too much of me. in short i should make that choice. we are all desperate here. remember if you have dont expect me to keep your secret. thered be two sides to it. equally like smoke if not more so. when they were alone mr. lorry asked him what he had done i could not see my father weep and sit by careless. and i could not respect your sorrow more if you were my father. he gave him his hand and carton gently pressed it. it seemed to be he returned the look and evidently understood it. dont speak of me to her. as i said to you when i first came i had better not see her. you are going to her i hope it attracted mr. lorrys eyes to cartons face which was turned to the fire. mr. lorrys eyes were again attracted to his face. i have my leave to pass. wouldnt she weep for you for as i draw closer and closer to the end i travel in the circle nearer and nearer to the beginning. my spy will find a place for me. he had heard of her going to the prison every day. we shall mount to a hundred soon. ha ha ha always. every day. less than two pipes. it was the settled manner of a tired man who had wandered and struggled and got lost but who at length struck into his road and saw its end. his mother had died years before. these solemn words which had been read at his fathers grave arose in his mind as he went down the dark streets among the heavy shadows with the moon and the clouds sailing on high above him. he did not seek it but repeated them and went on. perfectly calm and steady he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked but he heard them always. but the glorious sun rising seemed to strike those words that burden of the night straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays. he walked by the stream far from the houses and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the bank. mr. lorry was there and doctor manette was there. she was there sitting beside her father. if there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look on sydney carton it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly. every eye was turned to the jury. released yesterday. you know the accused to be the husband of my daughter. the president rang his bell and with warmth resumed. listen to what is to follow. doctor manette sat down with his eyes looking around and his lips trembling his daughter drew closer to him. why not say so i knew it from himself. he knew himself by no other name than one hundred and five north tower when he made shoes under my care. it falls. i examine it very closely. this is that written paper. this is the writing of doctor manette. hope has quite departed from my breast. i answered. said one. will you please to enter the carriage they were armed. i was not. enough. will you please to enter the carriage the carriage turned about and drove on at its former speed. i have no doubt that it is word for word the same. i was conducted to this chamber straight the cries growing louder as we ascended the stairs and i found a patient in a high fever of the brain lying on a bed. if i had known what i was coming to see i could have come provided. as it is time must be lost. asked the younger brother. as i intended to repeat it after a while and as it was necessary to watch its influence i then sat down by the side of the bed. i had to pass through that part to get at the other. he was then dying fast. said i. forced my brother to draw upon him and has fallen by my brothers sword like a gentleman. she have you seen her doctor i know it and have heard my father say so. she was a good girl. the other is his brother the worst of a bad race. what did the two then to persuade her husband to use his influence with her to make her willing but he was not persuaded. no taken out of harness one day at noon to feed if he could find food he sobbed twelve times once for every stroke of the bell and died on her bosom. i saw her pass me on the road. it was somewhere here i told her not to come near us till he was dead. he came in and first tossed me some pieces of money then struck at me with a whip. but i though a common dog so struck at him as to make him draw. let him break into as many pieces as he will the sword that he stained with my common blood he drew to defend himself thrust at me with all his skill for his life. that weapon was a gentlemans. in another place lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldiers. where is he proud as these nobles are he is afraid to see me. where is the man who was here turn my face to him. i mark this cross of blood upon you as a sign that i do it. i mark this cross of blood upon him as a sign that i do it. he stood for an instant with the finger yet raised and as it dropped he dropped with it and i laid him down dead. i knew that this might last for many hours and that it would probably end in the silence of the grave. one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve. hush he said looking down at her with some curiosity. the things that you see here are things to be seen and not spoken of. i was guarded in my answer for i was troubled in my mind with what i had heard and seen. there was life and no more. looking round as i resumed my seat i found both the brothers intent upon me. she asked me where she was and i told her who i was and i told her. it was in vain that i asked her for her family name. she faintly shook her head upon the pillow and kept her secret as the boy had done. said the elder when i went in. i took it from his hand but laid it on the table. i had considered the question and had resolved to accept nothing. from the first i had anxiously considered what i ought to do. i had kept the matter a profound secret even from my wife and this too i resolved to state in my letter. i rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it. it was the last day of the year. the letter was lying before me just completed when i was told that a lady waited who wished to see me. she was in great agitation. i suspect that i am watched more closely than i was and i know not at what times i may be watched. she did not know that the girl was dead. her hope had been she said in great distress to show her in secret a womans sympathy. i could tell her nothing but that there was such a sister beyond that i knew nothing. one was taken from me with a warning yesterday. i must finish my record today. how could she be when i handed her down to the door there was a child a pretty boy from two to three years old in her carriage. thou wilt be faithful little charles i never saw her more. when my servant came into the room where i sat with my wife o my wife beloved of my heart my fair young english wife we saw the man who was supposed to be at the gate standing silent behind him. not a word was spoken. i was brought here i was brought to my living grave. another and another. roar and roar. the people had all poured out to the show in the streets. my parting blessing on my love. i am supported from above dont suffer for me. i kiss her by you. no we know now what a struggle you made of old. we thank you with all our hearts and all our love and duty. good could never come of such evil a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning. be comforted and forgive me. only her father and mr. lorry were with her. his arm trembled as it raised her and supported her head. her father and their old friend got into it and he took his seat beside the driver. o look at her dear carton he put her gently from him and looked at her unconscious mother. but try i will write too and but stay well i should like to know how you speed though mind i expect nothing let us stretch the hour or two. darkness 
sydney carton paused in the street not quite decided where to go. i think so. but care care care it was not difficult for one who knew the city well to find his house without asking any question. for the first time in many years he had no strong drink. this done he went on direct to defarges and went in. he repeated what he had already said. and good wine. they were all leaning their arms on the counter close together speaking low. there is great force in that. i have observed his face. i have observed his face to be not the face of a true friend of the republic. i have observed her today and i have observed her other days. i have observed her in the court and i have observed her in the street by the prison. but i would leave the matter there. listen madame defarge took him to the door and put her arm on his in pointing out the road. but he went his way and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the prison wall. at the appointed hour he emerged from it to present himself in mr. lorrys room again where he found the old gentleman walking to and fro in restless anxiety. he had been more than five hours gone where could he be in the meanwhile carton would wait alone by the fire for the doctor. he waited and waited and the clock struck twelve but doctor manette did not come back. where could he be the instant he entered the room it was plain that all was lost. as he stood staring at them they asked him no question for his face told them everything. i have been looking everywhere for my bench and i cant find it. what have they done with my work yes he had better be taken to her. but before you go will you for a moment steadily attend to me carton took it up and there was a folded paper in it. mr. lorry nodded his consent. let me speak of it in its place. look at it. now take this paper that doctor manette has carried about him. but no matter dont stay to look put it up carefully with mine and your own. now observe it is good until recalled. i know it from her own lips. i have lost no time and since then i have seen the spy. it will depend on you and it could depend on no better man. your preparations have been completed for some days to return to england. did i say we could depend upon no better man tell her that it was her husbands last arrangement. quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in the courtyard here even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage. he entered the courtyard and remained there for a few moments alone looking up at the light in the window of her room. before he went away he breathed a blessing towards it and a farewell. they were in number as the weeks of the year. two score and twelve were told off. but all this was at first. he never thought of carton. his mind was so full of the others that he never once thought of him. he had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out. when he lay down on his straw bed he thought he had done with this world. neither were they connected with fear he was conscious of no fear. nine gone for ever ten gone for ever eleven gone for ever twelve coming on to pass away. twelve gone for ever. footsteps in the stone passage outside the door. he stopped. the key was put in the lock and turned. go you in alone i wait near. but he spoke and it was his voice he took the prisoners hand and it was his real grasp. i can scarcely believe it now. put your hands to them put your will to them. you will only die with me. when i ask you to pass out at that door tell me it is madness and remain here. the prisoner was like a young child in his hands. dear carton it is madness. it cannot be accomplished it never can be done it has been attempted and has always failed. when i ask that refuse. there are pen and ink and paper on this table. carton with his right hand in his breast stood close beside him. carton standing over him with his hand in his breast looked down. you do remember them i know. it is not in your nature to forget them. that i do so is no subject for regret or grief. take up the pen and finish. cartons hand moved back to his breast no more. such a thing has happened here often and too often. your life is in your own hands. quick the spy returned immediately with two men. there was none. breathing more freely in a little while he sat down at the table and listened again until the clock struck two. some were standing some seated. though the just heaven knows that i am innocent of any. is it likely hush whom have we within physician. french. many suffer with it. lucie. his daughter. french. lucie her child. english. sydney carton. english. he too is pointed out. it is not a great deal that jarvis lorry. english. the agony of our impatience is then so great that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running hiding doing anything but stopping. have these men deceived us and taken us back by another road is not this the same place twice over thank heaven no. a village. look back look back and see if we are pursued hush we are pursued within the carriage there. a brave number i love it. o pity us kind heaven and help us look out look out and see if we are pursued. madame defarge cast down her eyes and reflected a little. and we seldom have a child there. we have not half enough as it is. i must act for myself therefore. i know what i know. can i spare this doctor to my husband i have no feeling either way. she will be full of sympathy with its enemies. keep me my usual chair. she was absolutely without pity. if she had ever had the virtue in her it had quite gone out of her. to appeal to her was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity even for herself. such a heart madame defarge carried under her rough robe. lying hidden in her bosom was a loaded pistol. now pray let us think alas temple bar was hundreds of miles away and madame defarge was drawing very near indeed. i feel certain of it. there bless you mr. cruncher she looked at her watch and it was twenty minutes past two. she had no time to lose but must get ready at once. the basin fell to the ground broken and the water flowed to the feet of madame defarge. her first act was to shut them. there were four in the room and she shut them all. she then placed herself before the door of the chamber which lucie had occupied. madame defarges dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement and rested on her when it was finished. let me see her. go tell her that i wish to see her. i demand to see her. madame defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when miss pross first became aware of her but she now advanced one step. thus miss pross who had never struck a blow in her life. what are you worth three of the doors she opened swiftly and looked in. there is no one in that room behind you madame defarge made at the door. i am stronger than you i bless heaven for it. all this was in a second. it was dreadful to go in at the door again but she did go in and even went near it to get the bonnet and other things that she must wear. she then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to cry and then got up and hurried away. by good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet or she could hardly have gone along the streets without being stopped. in crossing the bridge she dropped the door key in the river. in the midst of these fluttering thoughts the escort appeared took her in and took her away. again mr. cruncher nodded his head. hark it would seem to be always the same question for it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart. he has no curiosity or care for the scene about him and always speaks to the girl. he cannot easily touch his face his arms being bound. he looks into the first of them not there. he looks into the second not there. ay louder vengeance much louder and still she will scarcely hear thee. louder yet vengeance with a little oath or so added and yet it will hardly bring her. see her knitting in my hand and her empty chair ready for her. crash crash she is five years younger than i and she lives in a farmers house in the south country. poverty parted us and she knows nothing of my fate for i cannot write and if i could how should i tell her i am so ignorant. am i to kiss you now i see her with a child upon her bosom who bears my name. so capable. and theyre right every time. jeeves was perfectly right. the man knows everything. he shook his head. the animal is not intended to win. still you know what happened. i went straight home and rang for jeeves. i first got to know corky when i came to new york. everybody was awfully good to me and there seemed to be plenty of things going on and im a wealthy bird so everything was fine. this makes it kind of difficult for a chappie. now a great many fellows think that having a rich uncle is a pretty soft snap but according to corky such is not the case. corkys uncle you see didnt want him to be an artist. he didnt think he had any talent in that direction. corky moreover believed in his future as an artist. some day he said he was going to make a hit. he had written a book called american birds and was writing another to be called more american birds. corky used to go to him about once every three months and let him talk about american birds. i should imagine jeeves feels very much the same about me. or words to that effect. she made me feel that there was nothing i wouldnt do for her. i saw his point. that was the catch. and i rang the bell. there was something about him that gave me confidence. naturally the poor chaps face dropped for this seemed to dish the whole thing. quite unlike our london houses. the girl made an objection. i saw what he meant. they dont seem able to stick it at any price. a little thing like this would be nothing to him. said jeeves. i know because ive been one myself. it was certainly some book. you see. it was great stuff. i didnt see how the uncle could fail to drop. i said. said corky. shortly after this i had to go out of town. i went up and passed the time of day. i said. i had forgotten what a long time i had been away. i spun round. a chappie with a lot of stiff grey hair and a red sort of healthy face was standing there. absolutely. i noticed it first that night he came to dinner with us my dear to be introduced to you. i said i had. what i needed then was air not dinner. i felt that i wanted to get into the open and think this thing out. i called him. please yourself. but youre going to get a shock. you remember my friend mr. you cant rattle jeeves. i cut washington square out absolutely for the next few months. i told jeeves to drink it himself. absolutely. i hardly knew what to do. absent treatment seemed the touch. i gave it him in waves. a fellow has to be ready for that sort of thing. i said and started to back out. corky looked over his shoulder. dont go. corky stood there looking at the door and then he turned to me and began to get it off his chest. fortunately he seemed to take it for granted that i knew all about what had happened so it wasnt as awkward as it might have been. the portraits to be a surprise for her on her birthday. can you beat it i patted his shoulder silently. i began to see that i was letting myself in for something. it was only too easy. whats jeeves got to do with it who wants jeeves if you think i am going to face that uncle of yours without jeevess support youre mistaken. thats the sort of chap he is. you cant rattle him. the light from the big window fell right on the picture. i took a good look at it. then i went back to where i had been at first because it hadnt seemed quite so bad from there. said corky anxiously. i hesitated a bit. he groaned. i dont see how he could have managed it in the time. said corky. corky was starting to say something when the door opened and the uncle came in. well bring it out. lets have a look at it. this will be a wonderful surprise for your aunt. where is it he exclaimed. i wouldnt let you paint a house of mine but let me tell you this. then the door closed and he was no longer with us. i whispered faintly. corky was standing staring at the picture. his face was set. there was a hunted look in his eye. what can i do you heard what he said. i couldnt think of a thing to say. i knew exactly how he felt about the office. and then a soothing voice broke the silence. it was jeeves. he had slid from the shadows and was gazing gravely at the picture. perhaps you have met him it was a favourite saying of his that there is always a way. i consider the suggestion a very valuable one sir. and then suddenly he began to laugh in a wild way. the mans absolutely right youve hit on the greatest idea of the age report at the office on monday start at the bottom of the business ill buy the business if i feel like it. hell eat this thing. he was telling me only the other day how hard it was to get a good new series. wheres my hat ive got an income for life jeeves was right. there could be no other title. i always have been. there was a fellow one would have said clear up to the eyebrows in the soup. yet look at him now. youve got to consider that you know. what theres no doubt the mans right. its absolutely that way with me. a moment before they turned up i was just thinking how thoroughly all right everything was. i didnt so much mind when he made me give up one of my new suits because jeevess judgment about suits is sound. i stopped singing and opened the door an inch. i met her at lunch one sunday before i left london. it was a shock to me. it was rather a solemn moment. ive seen you give it a nasty look before. speak out like a man a cheerful pink. dashed unpleasant. i could see that the man was wounded. but i was firm. i said. oh rather i didnt get this for a moment. i mean put him up here. i am extremely interested in prison conditions in america. no doubt you read my book india and the indians i wished i could have had a minute with him alone. i felt certain that he would have been able to think of some way of putting a stop to this woman. he has lived quietly with me in the country. she got up. i dont know what i should have done without your help. it will be such a help. you heard it all didnt you you were in the diningroom most of the time. i looked at jeeves sharply. this sort of thing wasnt like him. then i understood. the man was really upset about that tie. he was trying to get his own back. i could have sobbed into the bacon and eggs. that there wasnt any sympathy to be got out of jeeves was what put the lid on it. there was nothing i could do. there was absolutely nothing for it but to put the fellow up and make the best of it. i could tell by the chappies manner that he was still upset. he went out and came back again. i went to the front door. the man was right. i took another look. once on the right track you couldnt mistake it. it seemed to me that i had let myself in for something pretty rocky. i said. what ho after that it seemed rather difficult to go on with the conversation. i asked. i must see more of that lad. but he wouldnt have it at any price. he replied firmly. i drank too much much too much. lots and lots too much and whats more im going to do it again im going to do it every night. i sat on the edge of the bed. but duty first this is the first time ive been let out alone and i mean to make the most of it. were only young once. young man rejoice in thy youth put like that it did seem reasonable. when that happens we talk about it for days. this is my only chance to collect a past and im going to do it. does one ring a bell or shout a bit so the next night i took him along to supper with me. it was the last time. he had about four weeks to have the good time that ought to have been spread over about ten years and i didnt wonder at his wanting to be pretty busy. i should have been just the same in his place. absolutely becoming the good old shadow i give you my honest word. and no sympathy from jeeves. that was what cut me to the quick. so dashed absurd dont you know. it wasnt as if there was anything wrong with that country gentleman hat. this was where i began to crack under the strain. you see the part of town where i was living wasnt the right place for that sort of thing. that was all right. they like that sort of thing down there. there really is nobody like jeeves. yet directly he caught sight of me again he got all worked up and seemed to have only one idea in life to start chewing me where he had left off. i thought for a bit. as a matter of fact i was back within the week. i thanked rocky for his kind hospitality and caught the only train they have down in those parts. i went straight to the old flat. evidently when you got to know him better he had a lot of intelligence in him. i said. thats how i felt then. i lowered myself into a chair. i said. it was the only thing that could have pulled him up. there was a kind of grieved look in his eye. i hadnt been expecting her for days. there was something sort of bleak about her tone rather as if she had swallowed an east wind. or a sausage or something there was a bit of a silence. we were always together. we had a great time. i ought to have let you know but of course we didnt know where you were. i tried to think of something to say but nothing came. i was dumb. i hadnt any remarks to make. it didnt rattle jeeves. i said. he embraced it eagerly. i could see her struggling with the thing. then she got up. i said. for a moment i hesitated. then i made up my mind. i felt as if the clouds had rolled away and all was as it used to be. its not so bad now im in new york but in london the anxiety was frightful. it happened after i had been in america for a few months. i said. this was news to me that bickys uncle was a duke. jeeves knows everything. i began to understand why poor old bicky was always more or less on the rocks. not that that explained why he was hunting me like this because he was a chap who never borrowed money. jeeves floated out to answer it. i said. bicky seemed a bit surprised. i bet jeeves knows all about it already. said bicky rattled. bicky gave a hollow sort of laugh. i didnt fancy the idea a bit. i hate horses. they bite at you. i was all against the scheme. he wrote back that it was all right and here ive been ever since. he thinks im doing well at something or other over here. i never dreamed dont you know that he would ever come out here. ive always given him the impression that i was living in pretty good style. i said. said bicky firmly. bicky followed him with his eye till the door closed. he said. i believe its something to do with the shape of his head. i hopped out of bed early next morning so as to be among those present when the old boy should arrive. it wasnt much after nine by the time id dressed and had my morning tea and was leaning out of the window watching the street for bicky and his uncle. i called to jeeves. im staying with him you know. would you like a cup of tea a terrible country he took another look round the room. i could guess what the old boy was thinking. something in the air dont you know. what is the nature of my nephews business mr. i slid for the door. i missed him. i went and dressed sadly. i said. he said. he had another go at the glass. it didnt seem to do him any good. my next months money was due to roll in on saturday. say you buy a hen call it one hen for the sake of argument. or look at it another way suppose you have a dozen eggs. each of the hens has a dozen chickens. the chickens grow up and have more chickens. youd make a fortune. thats always the way in this world. the thing startled poor old bicky considerably. bicky looked at me in a helpless kind of way. im bound to say i didnt get it myself. bicky didnt seem to think much of it. will there be anything further the whole thing im inclined to think would have been off if it hadnt been for jeeves. there is no doubt that jeeves is in a class of his own. i was amazed. this chappie was a napoleon. i thought a bit. bickyll never know. when i took dear old bicky aside in the course of the morning and told him what had happened he nearly broke down. rather not the old boy seemed a bit rattled. cried the old boy getting purple. im not saying anything mind you but theres one thing that seems kind of funny to me. im only asking. ive a right to know. i am feeling a little tired. the chappie seemed troubled. they went out and there was a pretty solid silence. bicky didnt seem to have anything to say. bicky seemed pretty well knocked out so i put in a word. all he wants is a bit of capital. i said. i said. said bicky. ill do it er wait my boy no no my boy i would not suggest it. i would not for a moment suggest it. said bicky rolling it round his tongue. it stands to reason. suppose you have a dozen hens. each of the hens has a dozen chickens. after a bit the chickens grow up and have a dozen chickens each themselves and then they all start laying eggs theres a fortune in it. you can get anything you like for eggs in america. said bicky. a gleam of hope shone in the chappies eye mixed with doubt. there was a moments silence. i could see the fellow was deeply moved. its a most interesting story. if youre a man you mustnt miss it because itll be a warning to you and if youre a woman you wont want to because its all about how a girl made a man feel pretty well fed up with things. yet its true. believe me. people have called me a silly ass but i was never in the same class with bobbie. by doing this i generally managed to get him unless he had left town before my messenger arrived. the funny thing was that he wasnt altogether a fool in other ways. i had known him once or twice show an almost human intelligence. at least thats what i thought. but there was another way which hadnt occurred to me. marriage i mean. he married. it looks good to him. but he still doesnt know whats at the end of it till he gets there. it was like that with bobbie. and yet i dont know. quite the romance. bobbie broke the news to me at the club one evening and next day he introduced me to her. i admired her. almost forgot to mention it. we dont now but well come to that later. im speaking of the past. and bobbie seemed to think the same about her. the story doesnt really start till then. they took a flat and settled down. i was in and out of the place quite a good deal. if this was marriage i thought i couldnt see why fellows were so frightened of it. there were a lot of worse things that could happen to a man. i couldnt begin to describe it. she stared at him as if she had never seen him before. then she turned scarlet. then she turned as white as a sheet. then she gave a little laugh. it was most interesting to watch. made me wish i was up a tree about eight hundred miles away. then she recovered herself. and after that she was all right. at least you would have said so. quite a jolly little party it was not. he seemed glad to have someone to talk to about it. he said. i didnt exactly. then i understood. i saw light a regular flash of light. i didnt ask for details. there didnt seem much to be done. he didnt want to talk. presently he went out. it was from now on that i began to be really interested in this problem of bobbies married life. and nature mind you on bobbies side. take my case for instance. well if i had remembered half the things people have tried to teach me during my life my size in hats would be about number nine. but i didnt. i forgot them. and it was just the same with bobbie. but bless you the shock wasnt nearly big enough. pretty soon he was back at the old game. the poor girl loved him and she was frightened. i saw that clearly enough and i tried to make bobbie see it when he was by way of pouring out his troubles to me one afternoon. i cant remember what it was that he had forgotten the day before but it was something she had asked him to bring home for her it may have been a book. i cant remember anything. i asked though i knew. i said. i said. he got quite excited. then i spoke to him like a father. youve got to make an effort. dont say you cant. bear that in mind and youre all right. i dont see that i could have done any more. but no. off he went again in the same old way. after that you may get a chance. but till then theres nothing to be done. but i thought a lot about him. bobbie didnt get into the soup all at once. weeks went by and months and still nothing happened. i said. gone left me i said. silly question perhaps youre right. how should i know where he pushed the paper into my hand. it was a letter. so i did. it certainly was quite a letter. there was not much of it but it was all to the point. said bobbie. i said. i said. think i havent thought holmes heres a case for you. when is my wifes birthday for instance cant you remember the last time she had a birthday what sort of weather was it bobbie shook his head. i ordered two more of the same. bobbie seemed to be thinking. i gave her a present on her last birthday. some days youre right off others its as easy as falling off a log. i dont suppose dear old bobbie had ever had two ideas in the same morning before in his life but now he did it without an effort. do you know those little books called when were you born theres one for each month. bobbies idea was to buy the whole twelve and go through them till we found out which month hit off marys character. that would give us the month and narrow it down a whole lot. he took half and i took half and we settled down to work. as i say it sounded good. there was plenty of information all right but there wasnt a single month that didnt have something that exactly hit off mary. we took a bit of a rest then had another go at the thing. which he owned was about as like mary as anything could be. in the end he tore the books up stamped on them burnt them and went home. it was wonderful what a change the next few days made in dear old bobbie. i dont suppose he had ever troubled to think in his life before not really think. but now he was wearing his brain to the bone. it was painful in a way of course to see a fellow human being so thoroughly in the soup but i felt strongly that it was all for the best. i saw a great deal of him these days. i was his best friend and he came to me for sympathy. i gave it him too with both hands but i never failed to hand him the moral lesson when i had him weak. one day he came to me as i was sitting in the club and i could see that he had had an idea. he looked happier than he had done in weeks. this time im convinced that i shall pull it off. i said. i said. i recollect them distinctly. and bobbie said that there wouldnt. once you get your memory on the run it parts as if it enjoyed doing it. it was bobbie of course. its just come to me. i said. i heard him give a sort of howl. its this. ive always said so. i believe youve got it. presently he came back again. he said. i waited patiently. said marys voice. is that mr. she gave a sort of scream. ive often thought how interesting it must be to be one of those exchange girls. the things they must hear dont you know. most interesting it must be. she gasped. well i hadnt. but id got just as far as this when she bit at me. absolutely i heard the snap. in that choked kind of way. like that it means all the bad words shed love to say if she only knew them. and then she began. and if i did i didnt mean it. i had finished. quite the little lump of fun and all that sort of thing. as we might have guessed it was a girl. what the row had been about he didnt say but apparently she was pretty well fed up. i was sorry for poor old freddie. i knew what it felt like. i knew the thing for freddie. ive taken a cottage there. i knew a man. girl refused him. man went abroad. but freddie wouldnt be comforted. he just went on looking as if he had swallowed his last sixpence. he said he might as well be there as anywhere. it isnt what youd call a fiercely exciting spot but it has its good points. it seemed to suit poor old freddie. i said. i said. this is the best thing that could have happened. but dont mind that. put this thing in my hands. ill see you through. i thought for a moment. that was freddie all over dont you know. a dear old chap in a thousand ways but no help to a fellow if you know what i mean. dear old freddie had his strong qualities. she was sitting on the sand helping a small fat child build a castle. and i walked on. well i dont mind. i admit it. it came to me on my return journey. the girl wasnt with him. in fact there didnt seem to be any one in sight. i thought the whole thing out in a flash dont you know. so i gathered in the kid and made off with him. freddie dear old chap was rather slow at getting on to the fine points of the idea. he said. it was the right stuff. said freddie when silence had set in. i explained the idea. after a while it began to strike him. i dont know when ive felt so happy. i was so fond of dear old freddie that to know that he was soon going to be his old bright self again made me feel as if somebody had left me about a million pounds. and freddie looked as if he hadnt a friend in the world. i said. freddie sank into a chair and groaned. he said. hes just a kid she happened to meet on the beach. oh lord ive had a time it took him a good long time to tell the story for he broke off in the middle of nearly every sentence to call me names but i gathered gradually what had happened. youd have thought from the lack of interest in him that he was stopping there all by himself in a cottage of his own. i shot off there like an arrow and knocked at the door. nobody answered. i knocked again. i looked up and saw a round pink face with grey whiskers east and west of it staring down from an upper window. it shouted again. i said. i could hear voices. said the face. we could not think what we were to do with him. it was most fortunate your finding him. you must take tootles to your house. i have written to my brother in london to come and fetch him. till then tootles can stop with you. it is an excellent plan. very much obliged to you. i breathed a deep breath and wiped my forehead. the window flew up again. never mind. tootles takes them for breakfast with a little milk. my spirit was broken if you know what i mean. i accepted the situation. taking tootles by the hand i walked slowly away. the sight of her had a marked effect on the kid tootles. the girl stopped and smiled. she said bending down to him. he didnt speak for a long time but on the other hand when he began he did not leave off for a long time. heavens he got up. i cried. my voice shook. you must. your mother likes me. he sat down again. he looked at me in a curious way. freddie stood looking at the pile of clothes on the floor and i knew what he was thinking. but how were we to get him into his clothes again i stirred the pile with my foot. there was a long linen arrangement which might have been anything. we went there before breakfast and borrowed their nurse. women are wonderful by george they are she had that kid dressed and looking fit for anything in about eight minutes. i sat down to breakfast almost cheerful again. whose work is this second act his adventures with it. ill rough it out tonight. he said. always safe stuff. parted lovers. its big. child centre.  freddie up stage by the piano. but the rests all right. hold picture for a moment. then big speech. very well. and so on. freddie must work up his own part. and we must get a good line for the child. we want something more ah we can easily corner her on the beach somewhere when were ready. he wasnt in the mood to have a thing like that hanging over him. well this was every bit as exciting. and then hed go all to pieces again. and time was flying. we must work my goodness that kids a bad study. whenever there was any kind of sweet near he had a dash at his line and kept on saying something till he got what he was after. thats not going to win any girls heart. and she might do it too. but by george we didnt. the curtain went up the very next afternoon. it was nobodys fault certainly not mine. it was just fate. she said. she didnt wait for an answer. she just came. she seemed to be that sort of girl. i tried to break up the scene. said the girl. she listened for a moment. she said. i said. he cant bear to be disturbed when hes working. west is the name. oh he seems to have stopped. i suppose he will be out in a minute now. i said. she had started talking to the kid and didnt hear. she was feeling in her pocket for something. that finished it. he got it right first time. he shouted. he looked at the girl and the girl looked at him. he yelled. said the girl turning to me. said the girl again. her face was pink and her eyes were sparkling in the sort of way dont you know that makes a fellow feel as if he hadnt any bones in him if you know what i mean. then i said it was nothing. then i said it was nothing much. and the girl didnt speak either. she just stood listening. and then she began to laugh. i never heard a girl laugh so much. i gave poor old freddie up in despair. if only he had said a word it might have been all right. what can a fellow do with a fellow like that he said. wheres the kid the things finished. i told him. we must go back at once. i cried. i wouldnt bore you dont you know for the world but i think you ought to hear about it. in fact it was i who had worked him into the party. the aunt had died when george was quite a kid. kill two birds with one stone dont you know. i hardly recognized it. i yelled. you wouldnt have believed he had a drop of any sort of emotion in him. youve called me early all right. so i had a solitary breakfast and went up on deck to smoke. it was a lovely morning. i thought she looked a bit pale and tired. she said she hadnt slept well. unless you get your eight hours where are you i asked. she said. then i got at mine and saw what they were talking about. the paper was full of it. about five minutes later just as the rest of them were going to move off to breakfast a boat hailed us and came alongside. want to see him hell be up in a moment. i shouted. no answer. i opened the door and went in. the room was empty. i dont know when ive been more surprised. i went on deck. but hell be back soon for breakfast. youd better wait for him. no i sat smoking and thinking and then smoking a bit more when i thought i heard somebody call my name in a sort of hoarse whisper. i cried. he whispered. he gave a sigh of relief sank into my chair and closed his eyes. i regarded him with pity. i said touching him on the shoulder. what did you do it for whats the sense of it how do you suppose you can ever make yourself popular if you go about touching people on the shoulder it may have been less. she accepted me. i was just going to kiss her when we heard someone coming. i went out. i was off my head with joy. i hardly knew what i was doing. i couldnt wait. it might have been the ships cat. it wasnt. it did. i was mad. i didnt care what became of me. i simply wanted to forget. i went ashore. i its just on the cards that i may have drowned my sorrows a bit. i dived for the paper. he read. he said. he read the paper again. he jumped a foot in the air. he arrived just before you did. he said he wanted to see you on business and wouldnt give his name. i didnt like the look of him from the first. i mean mine. you must light out if you want to spend the rest of your life out of prison. i said. are they all still at breakfast he retired. i called to george and he came out. he brought a letter for you. theyre all at breakfast still. he began to read his letter. he said as he finished. when no news was received of him for so many years it     was supposed that he was dead. he states that he is on     his way to meet me and will arrive any day now. but i will go fully into the matter with you when we     meet. i thought that meant me but apparently there are a crowd of us. all youve got to do is to stay here and be your brother alfred. i cried. whos to say you arent alfred if you swear you are its not as if you had to keep it up for the rest of your life. at last the thing seemed to sink into him. if they want proof show them your mole. we spun round. i looked at george. george looked at me. i said. by no means. it was a hundred down and the promise of another hundred when we had got safely away before he was satisfied. i asked. its a long story. george had a letter from his uncle about him yesterday. i shouldnt wonder if thats where george has gone to see his uncle and find out about it. in the meantime alfred has arrived. youll think it is george at first. look they were rattled. there was no doubt about that. they stood looking at him as if they thought there was a catch somewhere but werent quite certain where it was. do you know george well mr. he turned his back and stooped and showed the mole. his collar hid it at ordinary times. he asked. that seemed to satisfy them all. they couldnt get away from it. didnt i say that alfred would fix things for george i told her she looked worried and got her to tell me what the trouble was. we were moving towards the companion way to go below for lunch when a boat hailed us. we went to the side and looked over. he said. the stout man stared at him. im bound to say i rather liked his manner. i gave him the afternoon off. she had been crying. i didnt see what business if was of hers but she seemed all worked up about it so i told her. im hopeless in a situation like this. which didnt seem to help much i hadnt any remarks to make. i meant to get to the bottom of this. she sobbed. i was firm. and eventually she yielded up the facts. things began to piece themselves together. i went up to interview george. georges was like that. he looked green. i said. hes been at it for years ever since i was a kid. he knew i should find out sooner or later but meanwhile he would be able to get off to south america which he has done. if you come to think of it what a queer thing life is so unlike anything else dont you know if you see what i mean. you cant tell when you may be going to get it. why thats what i asked myself. just life dont you know. thats all there was about it. it was close on six oclock when our third visitor of the day arrived. he was worried. so for that matter were george and i only not for the same reason. he said. asked the count anxiously. i know what he looks like now. george put his foot down firmly on the suggestion. and quickly. shouted george. george sat down suddenly. we were wrong. but before he lost consciousness he perceived a young man in evening dress wearing the hat you found running swiftly towards him. his face was flushed his hat was on the back of his head and he was smoking a fat cigar. he shouted. you wont be the first this afternoon whos stared at the mysterious stranger who won for two hours without a break. ill learn you to break a poor mans heart. those were his very words. george got up. asked the count. she cried. he said. theres just one bit more. they seemed to be having an argument. said george. he said. i said. i popped. but then ive had it thrust on my notice by george in a way i should imagine has happened to pretty few fellows. i loved her dont you know. and there was a time for about a week when we were engaged to be married. in fact to be absolutely honest i was jolly thankful the thing had ended as it had done. this letter im telling you about arrived one morning out of a blue sky as it were. how are you we have settled down here in the most perfect old     house with a lovely garden in the middle of delightful country. couldnt you run down here for a few days clarence and i would be     so glad to see you. bill is here and is most anxious to meet you     again. he was speaking of you only this morning. do come. we can give you new milk and fresh eggs. think of that it rattled me rather i must confess. so i went. i hadnt come across him for some months and i was glad to see him again. and he apparently was glad to see me. i asked. nothing else is mentioned in this household. clarence is an artist. so is his father. during the period when i had let her do just what she wanted to do with me i had had to follow her like a dog through gallery after gallery though pictures are poison to me just as they are to old bill. somehow it had never struck me that she would still be going on in this way after marrying an artist. i should have thought that by this time the mere sight of a picture would have fed her up. not so however according to old bill. i go there tomorrow. the idea was that i was to come back after the match. he turned and stared at me and nearly ran us into the bank. elizabeth has mended it with pink silk. what was the game that was what i wanted to know. ive often heard that young married women are all over that sort of thing. as we pulled up at the front door it opened and a womans figure appeared. i said. she came down into the light. it was elizabeth looking just the same as in the old days. im so glad you were able to come. i was afraid you might have forgotten all about it. you know what you are. have you ever been turned down by a girl who afterwards married and then been introduced to her husband if so youll understand how i felt when clarence burst on me. you know the feeling. thats what i thought when i set eyes on clarence. and elizabeth mind you is one of those tall splendid girls who look like princesses. hark said clarence. all in one breath dont you know. i said. he was built on the same lines as clarence but was an earlier model. elizabeth introduced us. we talked pictures steadily till it was time to dress for dinner. at least they did. i just sort of sat around. it was the first time i had had a chance of breaking into the conversation with any effect and i meant to make the most of it. i went and fetched it. exactly at the same time like a chorus. yes. i noticed her eyes were sparkling. she said. he cried. they all seemed wonderfully excited. anyway it was not till elizabeth showed it to me that i was aware of its existence. she and i were alone in the drawingroom after dinner. and the moment she said it i knew something was going to happen. well i got it then. there what i mean is after what had happened youd have thought she would have preferred to let the dead past bury its dead and all that sort of thing what mind you i had said i would do anything in the world for her. i admit that. he doesnt need to take anything. what i mean is well you know what i mean. all i can say is that its funny i hadnt noticed it. i said. she nodded. and then i began to see daylight. and believe me it had hit clarence badly. it was this way. he said so and he ought to have known. well when clarence married he had given it to him as a wedding present and had hung it where it stood with his own hands. all right so far what he couldnt stand it at any price. he didnt like the drawing. he didnt like the expression of the face. in fact it made him feel quite ill to look at it. she said. i took a steady look at clarences effort. it seemed to me very much like the other one. i said. mark you sherlock holmes would have made the same mistake. on the evidence i mean. you never had any taste about pictures. this was so absolutely true that i had no remark to make. she came up to me and put her hand on my arm. i didnt mean to be cross. only i do want to make you understand that clarence is suffering. suppose suppose well let us take the case of a great musician. well its just like that with clarence. but what i mean is where do i come in i looked at her. her eyes were shining with excitement. when i asked you to come here i had just got the idea. think ill give you a sharp knife. yesterday. it sounded simple enough. she always did have the most wonderful eyes. she looked at me. the first thing i did on getting to the diningroom was to open the window. i had put my lantern on the table and was just reaching out for it when something happened. what it was for the moment i couldnt have said. i sat up. i said. i came in here and saw a lantern on the table and the window open and a chap with a knife in his hand so i didnt stop to make inquiries. i just let go at his jaw for all i was worth. what on earth do you think youre doing no well how about getting this job finished and going to bed and lets be quick about it too. ill hold the light. it was as easy a job as elizabeth had said. i rolled it up. youd set the chimney on fire. lets do the thing comfortably. weve done him a bit of good this trip. my room was just over the diningroom and the sound came up to us quite distinctly. and then a chair falling over. old bills like that. if i had been alone it would have taken me about three seconds to persuade myself that i hadnt really heard anything after all. he was out of his chair in one jump. i felt like it. we crept downstairs. old bill took a grip of the handle turned it quickly and in he went. and then we pulled up sharp staring. the room was in darkness except for a feeble splash of light at the near end. he had made a final cut just as we rushed in. turning at the sound he stopped and he and the chair and the candle and the picture came down in a heap together. the candle went out. said bill. i felt the same. i picked up the candle and lit it and then a most fearful thing happened. i looked at old bill. old bill looked at me. we shut the door quick and after that we didnt know what to do. it made it all so simple. i knew you would put it down to the same gang clarence my boy. then he doesnt know even now young men i throw myself on your mercy. dont be hard on me. it is my child. i watched it grow. i loved it. it was part of my life. and then clarence married and in a mad moment i gave my treasure to him. the thing was done. i knew that i could never bring myself to ask him for it back. and yet i was lost without it. what could i do till this evening i could see no hope. clarence would never suspect. once the idea had come i could not drive it out. at last i yielded and crept down here to carry out my plan. i mean what i know. he paused. he started poor old chap. i shook my head. what are you talking about do you think i dont know my own picture my child my venus. see can you read boy jeeves is my man you know. jeeves was in on the thing from the start. rocky you see lived down on long island somewhere miles away from new york and not only that but he had told me himself more than once that he never got up before twelve and seldom earlier than one. he was a poet. he had his scheme of life worked out to a fine point. rocky showed me one of his things once. it began
    be be the past is dead. tomorrow is not born. be today today be rocky said they gave him a hundred dollars for it and he stayed in bed till four in the afternoon for over a month. its a mystery to me how he does it. i said. at this point i fell asleep again. said rocky. i     am old and worn out. said rocky. i went to see her last christmas and she was bursting with health. her doctor told me himself that there was nothing wrong with her whatever. but she will insist that shes a hopeless invalid so he has to agree with her. i     have now decided to do so on one condition. my one condition is that you     live in new york and enjoy yourself as i have always wished to do. i want you to be the life and soul of brilliant     supper parties. said rocky. i said. it amazed me. i said. he cried. the very thought of staying more than a day in it makes me sick. i was shocked absolutely shocked. the man was still standing like a statue by the door. if you remember we cannot wear the third. i turned to rocky. i cant do it ill be hanged if ill do it how on earth can i dress up like that i said. i saw his point. i said. jeeves cleared his throat respectfully. rocky looked at me in a helpless sort of way. he said. i knew we could stand on jeeves. all youve got to do is to get somebody to go round the town for you and take a few notes and then you work the notes up into letters. the light of hope gleamed in rockys eyes. he said. i said. for the first time in our long connection i observed jeeves almost smile. i know exactly what your aunt wants to hear about rocky. jeeves shook his head. i said to rocky. we were all full of beans. everything went absolutely right from the start. id never imagined he could look so nearly human. as for the rest of us i was feeling pretty good because i was fond of old rocky and glad to be able to do him a good turn. i read one of her letters to rocky and it was full of life. its not a bad place. im not having a bad time. everythings pretty all right. dont know when i shall be back. hows     everybody new york seems     more wonderful every day. i didnt know jeeves was such an authority. we were quite a gay party. they certainly did by george it wasnt that he spoke loud. and in came a large solid female. i stared at her. then i looked at jeeves. she said. she seemed disappointed. she said. she had me with the first shot. i couldnt think of anything to say. he vanished and the aunt took the chair which id forgotten to offer her. it was a nasty look. it made me feel as if i were something the dog had brought in and intended to bury later on when he had time. she frowned as if she had expected better things of old rocky. it wasnt mark you as if she had spoken in a way to suggest that she considered my presence in the place as an ordinary social call. it hurt her my being there. i said. she spoke as if she had never heard of the stuff. the man was reading the evening paper as if he hadnt a care in the world. i wanted sympathy dont you know sympathy and kindness. i remembered. weve got to get him up here as soon as ever we can. just so sir. she hadnt moved an inch. she gave me another of those looks as i came in. there was no doubt about it for some reason she had taken a dislike to me. it was a bit hard on a chap. she raised her eyebrows and drank me in a bit more through her glasses. she said. put like that of course it did seem reasonable. certainly. i was jolly glad to see him. theres nothing like having a bit of business arranged for one when one isnt certain of ones lines. i said. it wasnt what i had meant to say. still it covered the situation. i poured her out a cup. i admitted it. she didnt say a word. and somehow she did it in a way that made it worse than if she had spoken for hours. then i tried again. i said. i didnt get it for the moment then it hit me. the full horror of the situation rolled over me like a wave. i couldnt see what on earth i was to do. the thing was too much for me. i crept into jeevess den. i whispered. she thinks the whole place is his and everything in it. i dont see what youre to do except stay on and keep it up. he looked wounded. but do it as a personal favour to me. i hadnt thought of that. i looked round the place. the moment of parting had come. i felt sad. of course when you come to think of it there must be quite a lot of fellows who have to press their own clothes themselves and havent got anybody to bring them tea in the morning and so on. it was rather a solemn thought dont you know. i got dressed somehow. im not sure this didnt make me feel worse. it was like what somebody or other wrote about the touch of a vanished hand. i had a bit of dinner somewhere and went to a show of some kind but nothing seemed to make any difference. i simply hadnt the heart to go on to supper anywhere. somehow i found myself moving about the room softly as if there had been a death in the family. five times thinking he hadnt got me. it was rocky. his troubles seemed to have had the worst effect on his character. i wish to goodness it would and give me a chance to breathe. how on earth can i dance when i dont know a soul to dance with its all the same. it was you who suggested leaving it to jeeves. it was those letters i wrote from his notes that did the mischief. i made them too good my aunts just been telling me about it. youve got a comfortable home and jeeves. she asked me what you did for a living. so if you think you have made a hit forget it. now i must be going back or shell be coming out here after me. next morning jeeves came round. i had to watch my chance. theres a lot in it. he had the air of one who was about to crack under the strain. it seemed to me that the aunt was looking slightly upset also. i didnt blame her. for a moment i had the idea that he had managed to get away from his aunt for the evening but looking past him i saw that she was in again. the man had moved me. youve got to. shes been like that for the last two days. i think shes beginning to suspect. a few nights ago i happened to run into two newspaper men i used to know fairly well. that kept me going for a while. but the effect has worn off now and shes beginning to wonder again. i went along. she looked as if she had been thinking a good deal about rather unpleasant things. said rocky. said rocky. and so the merry party began. i had gathered that at the beginning of her visit she had had to be dragged home with ropes. something told me that i was about to need him. barked the aunt and he dropped it. i caught rockys eye as he stooped to pick up the ruins. it was the eye of one who sees it coming. the aunt proceeded. i had not then seen the light. but now my eyes are open. i see the hideous mistake i have made. his fingers touched it and a look of relief came into the poor chappies face. i understood his feelings. i cried. id seen it happen before. she said. but for others less dead in sin he has his message. it was an accident that took me to his meeting. how often in this life a mere accident may shape our whole future the man has very little intelligence. i am thankful that he did. and it was not till the meeting had begun that i discovered the mistake which had been made. my seat was in the middle of a row. sometimes he expressed himself in a somewhat odd manner but every word carried conviction. i could have sunk through the floor. i came away a changed woman. rocky was holding on to the table as if it was his only friend. something was right everything was right wont you go back to the country tomorrow and begin the struggle it is the only way. he said. what do you do to get like that jeeves i believe you must eat a lot of fish or something. in the society of his nephew and niece and their children the old gentlemans days were comfortably spent. his attachment to them all increased. by a former marriage mr. henry dashwood had one son by his present lady three daughters. by his own marriage likewise which happened soon afterwards he added to his wealth. the old gentleman died his will was read and like almost every other will gave as much disappointment as pleasure. had he married a more amiable woman he might have been made still more respectable than he was he might even have been made amiable himself for he was very young when he married and very fond of his wife. he then really thought himself equal to it. it would be enough to make them completely easy. three thousand pounds she begged him to think again on the subject. perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself. but as he required the promise i could not do less than give it at least i thought so at the time. the promise therefore was given and must be performed. your sisters will marry and it will be gone for ever. the time may come when harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with. beyond anything great what brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters even if really his sisters and as it is only half blood they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them. his wife hesitated a little however in giving her consent to this plan. you are not aware of what you are doing. my mother was quite sick of it. it will certainly be much the best way. indeed to say the truth i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all. five hundred a year i am sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it and as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it. my father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say. a great deal too handsome in my opinion for any place they can ever afford to live in. but however so it is. your father thought only of them. they wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other. fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising. replied her mother with a smile. mrs. dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him. we shall live within a few miles of each other and shall meet every day of our lives. you will gain a brother a real affectionate brother. i have the highest opinion in the world of edwards heart. edward is very amiable and i love him tenderly. to satisfy me those characters must be united. he must enter into all my feelings the same books the same music must charm us both. oh i felt for my sister most severely. i could hardly keep my seat. but we must allow for difference of taste. i require so much it is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness. why should you be less fortunate than your mother had he ever been in the way of learning i think he would have drawn very well. marianne hardly knew what to say. she would not wound the feelings of her sister on any account and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible. marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased. you know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth. at present i know him so well that i think him really handsome or at least almost so. she felt that edward stood very high in her opinion. she tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister. like him oh ashamed of being otherwise. elinor could not help laughing. but farther than this you must not believe. i am by no means assured of his regard for me. but there are other points to be considered besides his inclination. he is very far from being independent. said she. oh elinor had given her real opinion to her sister. with such a knowledge as this it was impossible for elinor to feel easy on the subject. he understood that she was in need of a dwelling and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary if the situation pleased her. her resolution was formed as she read. they heard her with surprise. are you indeed going there so far from hence she explained the situation. she concluded with a very kind invitation to mr. and mrs. john dashwood to visit her at barton and to edward she gave one with still greater affection. the furniture was all sent around by water. when learn to feel a home elsewhere oh but you will continue the same. after winding along it for more than a mile they reached their own house. a narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden behind. but the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon dried away. they were cheered by the joy of the servants on their arrival and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy. the situation of the house was good. perhaps in the spring if i have plenty of money as i dare say i shall we may think about building. i could wish the stairs were handsome. sir john middleton was a good looking man about forty. his kindness was not confined to words for within an hour after he left them a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game. lady middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty her face was handsome her figure tall and striking and her address graceful. they were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood. they would see he said only one gentleman there besides himself a particular friend who was staying at the park but who was neither very young nor very gay. the young ladies as well as their mother were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party and wished for no more. he was silent and grave. lady middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner who pulled her about tore her clothes and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves. in the evening as marianne was discovered to be musical she was invited to play. sir john was loud in his admiration at the end of every song and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted. it must be so. she was perfectly convinced of it. it would be an excellent match for he was rich and she was handsome. mrs. jennings had been anxious to see colonel brandon well married ever since her connection with sir john first brought him to her knowledge and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl. at the park she laughed at the colonel and in the cottage at marianne. it is too ridiculous he may live twenty years longer. in my eyes it would be no marriage at all but that would be nothing. i am sure edward ferrars is not well. we have now been here almost a fortnight and yet he does not come. said mrs. dashwood. what can be the meaning of it they set off. he put down his gun and ran to her assistance. she had raised herself from the ground but her foot had been twisted in her fall and she was scarcely able to stand. mrs. dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged. the honour was readily granted and he then departed to make himself still more interesting in the midst of a heavy rain. but she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others and with an energy which always adorned her praise. every circumstance belonging to him was interesting. to be sure i do. sir john was rather puzzled. said elinor. miss marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself. it is not an employment to which they have been brought up. men are very safe with us let them be ever so rich. poor brandon is this just but i see what you mean. i have been too much at my ease too happy too frank. marianne was softened in a moment. he came to them every day. his society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment. and as she could not even wish him successful she heartily wished him indifferent. yes marianne even in a man between thirty and forty. he has seen a great deal of the world has been abroad has read and has a thinking mind. but it will not do. yet such was the case. elinor could not be surprised at their attachment. when he was present she had no eyes for any one else. every thing he did was right. every thing he said was clever. this was the season of happiness to marianne. elinors happiness was not so great. lady middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent. she had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before. willoughby was out of the question. elinors compassion for him increased as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him. i speak from experience. the lady would probably have passed without suspicion had he not convinced miss dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips. elinor attempted no more. but marianne in her place would not have done so little. you shall share its use with me. this was too much. elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more. she knew her sisters temper. i shall keep it only till you can claim it. i am almost sure it is for i saw him cut it off. this of course made every body laugh and elinor tried to laugh too. but the effort was painful. this increased the mirth of the company and margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more. but not so easily did elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her. by ten oclock the whole party was assembled at the park where they were to breakfast. while they were at breakfast the letters were brought in. among the rest there was one for colonel brandon he took it looked at the direction changed colour and immediately left the room. said sir john. nobody could tell. in about five minutes he returned. cried mrs. jennings. what a blow upon them all was this he shook his head. brandon is one of them. he was afraid of catching cold i dare say and invented this trick for getting out of it. but however i hope you will think better of it. colonel brandons horses were announced. added sir john. he then took leave of the whole party. to marianne he merely bowed and said nothing. he wished her a good morning and attended by sir john left the room. said almost every body. asked marianne. i am sure you must have heard of her before. she is a relation of the colonels my dear a very near relation. he drove through the park very fast and they were soon out of sight and nothing more of them was seen till their return which did not happen till after the return of all the rest. it was settled that there should be a dance in the evening and that every body should be extremely merry all day long. i hope you like your house miss marianne. marianne turned away in great confusion. i am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mrs.
smiths grounds or in seeing her house. it is a corner room and has windows on two sides. poor man i am afraid his circumstances may be bad. i do think he must have been sent for about money matters for what else can it be i wonder whether it is so. i would give anything to know the truth of it. i wonder what it can be his setting off in such a hurry seems very like it. so wondered so talked mrs. jennings. no. that i will never consent to. speaking to her in a lowered voice. the promise was readily given and willoughbys behaviour during the whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness. said mrs. dashwood when he was leaving them. he engaged to be with them by four oclock. mrs. dashwood looked at elinor with surprise. elinor felt equal amazement. for a few moments every one was silent. mrs. dashwood first spoke. mrs. dashwood was too much astonished to speak and another pause succeeded. he then hastily took leave of them all and left the room. they saw him step into his carriage and in a minute it was out of sight. so suddenly to be gone it seems but the work of a moment. and last night he was with us so happy so cheerful so affectionate and now after only ten minutes notice gone too without intending to return something more than what he owned to us must have happened. he did not speak he did not behave like himself. you must have seen the difference as well as i.  what can it be i have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way but you elinor who love to doubt where you can it will not satisfy you i know but you shall not talk me out of my trust in it. this is what i believe to have happened. you had rather take evil upon credit than good. is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love and no reason in the world to think ill of willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct and i will hope that he has. has not his behaviour to marianne and to all of us for at least the last fortnight declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation have we not perfectly understood each other my elinor is it possible to doubt their engagement has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time if you were to see them at the altar you would suppose they were going to be married. but i require no such proof. you cannot doubt your sisters wishes. it must be willoughby therefore whom you suspect. but why is he not a man of honour and feeling but all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed. willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected. they saw nothing of marianne till dinner time when she entered the room and took her place at the table without saying a word. she was without any power because she was without any desire of command over herself. she would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than when she lay down in it. she was awake the whole night and she wept the greatest part of it. she read nothing but what they had been used to read together. no letter from willoughby came and none seemed expected by marianne. her mother was surprised and elinor again became uneasy. it would be the natural result of your affection for her. cried marianne with strong surprise. beyond the entrance of the valley where the country though still rich was less wild and more open a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming to barton lay before them and on reaching that point they stopped to look around them and examine a prospect which formed the distance of their view from the cottage from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any of their walks before. it is not willoughby. his air his coat his horse. they were soon within thirty yards of the gentleman. she repeated surprised at his being so long in the same county with elinor without seeing her before. said elinor. cried marianne. now there is no one to regard them. look at those hills you may see the end of the house. said marianne to herself as she walked on. i have no wish to be distinguished and have every reason to hope i never shall. thank heaven i wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy but like every body else it must be in my own way. cried marianne. your ideas are only more noble than mine. elinor laughed. one is my wealth marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point. and books should not you marianne replied he with a sigh. all i have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour. how in what manner what am i to tell you edward made no answer. but before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open and turning round was astonished to see edward himself come out. marianne looked with amazement at edward with compassion at her sister. elinor only laughed. the subject was continued no farther and marianne remained thoughtfully silent till a new object suddenly engaged her attention. i remember her promising to give you some. elinor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise. he was particularly grave the whole morning. cried marianne. what said he in a low voice to miss dashwood by whom he was sitting. she gave him a brief reply. how can you never had any week passed so quickly he could hardly believe it to be gone. we never could agree in our choice of a profession. i always preferred the church as i still do. but that was not smart enough for my family. that was a great deal too smart for me. you are in a melancholy humour and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy. but remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by every body at times whatever be their education or state. know your own happiness. she happened to be quite alone. the closing of the little gate at the entrance of the green court in front of the house drew her eyes to the window and she saw a large party walking up to the door. amongst them were sir john and lady middleton and mrs. jennings but there were two others a gentleman and lady who were quite unknown to her. has she run away because we are come they were now joined by mrs. jennings who had not patience enough to wait till the door was opened before she told her story. how does mrs.
dashwood do and where are your sisters what all alone you will be glad of a little company to sit with you. i have brought my other son and daughter to see you. only think of their coming so suddenly i thought i heard a carriage last night while we were drinking our tea but it never entered my head that it could be them. she was short and plump had a very pretty face and the finest expression of good humour in it that could possibly be. she came in with a smile smiled all the time of her visit except when she laughed and smiled when she went away. what a delightful room this is i never saw anything so charming i always thought it such a sweet place maam turning to mrs.
dashwood but you have made it so charming only look sister how delightful every thing is how i should like such a house for myself should not you mr. mr. palmer made her no answer and did not even raise his eyes from the newspaper. mrs. palmer laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment and every body agreed two or three times over that it had been quite an agreeable surprise. mrs. palmer laughed and said it would not do her any harm. mr. palmer looked up on her entering the room stared at her some minutes and then returned to his newspaper. she got up to examine them. dear how beautiful these are well how delightful and then sitting down again she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room. when lady middleton rose to go away mr. palmer rose also laid down the newspaper stretched himself and looked at them all around. said his wife laughing. he then made his bow and departed with the rest. but they had no curiosity to see how mr. and mrs. palmer ate their dinner and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way. they attempted therefore likewise to excuse themselves the weather was uncertain and not likely to be good. but sir john would not be satisfied the carriage should be sent for them and they must come. lady middleton too though she did not press their mother pressed them. said marianne as soon as they were gone. it was quite a sudden thing our coming at all and i knew nothing of it till the carriage was coming to the door and then mr. palmer asked me if i would go with him to barton. he never tells me any thing they were obliged to put an end to such an expectation. you must come indeed. said he. how few people know what comfort is marianne looked very grave and said nothing. we do not live a great way from him in the country you know. there is not much difference. marianne remained perfectly silent though her countenance betrayed her interest in what was said. when they were seated in the dining room sir john observed with regret that they were only eight all together. it was impossible for any one to be more thoroughly goodnatured or more determined to be happy than mrs.
palmer. said she in a whisper to elinor. you cannot think how happy i shall be it will be quite delightful i am sure you will like it of all things. but poor fellow wont it how i shall laugh but do you know he says he will never frank for me dont you mr. mr. palmer took no notice of her. this is always the way with him i know why you inquire about him very well your sister is to marry him. colonel brandon tell you of it surely you must be mistaken. is it true pray it will be quite delightful i declare said elinor. nobody is more liked than mr. willoughby wherever he goes and so you may tell your sister. she is a monstrous lucky girl to get him upon my honour not but that he is much more lucky in getting her because she is so very handsome and agreeable that nothing can be good enough for her. you cant think how much i longed to see you it is so delightful that you should live at the cottage nothing can be like it to be sure and i am so glad your sister is going to be well married he was a particular friend of sir johns. sir john and lady middleton wished it very much. he had not seen me then above twice for it was before i left school. however i am much happier as i am. sir john wanted the whole family to walk to the park directly and look at his guests. it was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself. the children are all hanging about her already as if she was an old acquaintance. you will be delighted with them i am sure. how can you be so cross as not to come with such a reward for her tears the child was too wise to cease crying. she did her best when thus called on by speaking of lady middleton with more warmth than she felt though with far less than miss lucy. i never saw such fine children in my life. but i cant bear to see them dirty and nasty. dear and then to turn the discourse she began admiring the house and the furniture. what elinor heard all this with attention and surprise. where did he live elinor did think the question a very odd one and her countenance expressed it as she answered that she had never seen mrs. ferrars. elinor made her a civil reply and they walked on for a few minutes in silence. i am sure i would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours. but if i dared tell you all you would not be so much surprised. are you acquainted with mr. robert ferrars what felt elinor at that moment she paused. elinor for a few moments remained silent. elinor though greatly shocked still felt unable to believe it. did you never hear him talk of mr. we cannot mean the same mr. our first care has been to keep the matter secret. she was silent. poor edward it does not do him justice to be sure but yet i think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was drew for. they then proceeded a few paces in silence. lucy spoke first. besides in the present case i really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about edwards mother and i am so unfortunate that i have not a creature whose advice i can ask. you cant think how much i go through in my mind from it altogether. i only wonder that i am alive after what i have suffered for edwards sake these last four years. as she said this she looked directly at her companion. i cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable as i know the very mention of such a thing would do. and on my own account too so dear as he is to me i dont think i could be equal to it. what would you advise me to do in such a case miss dashwood repeated lucy. poor fellow elinor saw that it was his hand and she could doubt no longer. yes i have one other comfort in his picture but poor edward has not even that. if he had but my picture he says he should be easy. fortunately for her they had now reached the cottage and the conversation could be continued no farther. was his engagement to lucy an engagement of the heart no whatever it might once have been she could not believe it such at present. his affection was all her own. she could not be deceived in that. he certainly loved her. the young ladies went and lady middleton was happily preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her. and without farther ceremony she turned away and walked to the instrument. lady middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that she had never made so rude a speech. the remaining five were now to draw their cards. how could you suppose so but i am very glad to find it was only my own fancy and that you really do not blame me. your case is a very unfortunate one you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them. we must wait it may be for many years. lucy went on. lucy looked at elinor again and was silent. asked elinor. elinor blushed in spite of herself. lucy bit her lip and looked angrily at her sister. a mutual silence took place for some time. they were again silent for many minutes. but i dare say you will go for all that. but i only go for the sake of seeing edward. i am sure your mother can spare you very well and i do beg you will favour me with your company for ive quite set my heart upon it. it will only be sending betty by the coach and i hope i can afford that. i am sure your mother will not object to it for i have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you and if i dont get one of you at least well married before i have done with you it shall not be my fault. it is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure because miss dashwood does not wish it. but one or the other if not both of them i must have. lord bless me you will find margaret so improved when you come back again mariannes countenance sunk. mrs. dashwood smiled and said nothing. after very little farther discourse it was finally settled that the invitation should be fully accepted. in a few moments marianne did the same. this decided the matter at once. she could scarcely eat any dinner and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage. it was a great satisfaction to elinor that mrs. jennings by being much engaged in her own room could see little of what was passing. and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms when colonel brandon appeared. said he. he heard her with the most earnest attention but seeming to recollect himself said no more on the subject and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in london making the usual inquiries about their journey and the friends they had left behind. in this calm kind of way with very little interest on either side they continued to talk both of them out of spirits and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere. mrs. jennings soon came in. well colonel i have brought two young ladies with me you see that is you see but one of them now but there is another somewhere. your friend miss marianne too which you will not be sorry to hear. i do not know what you and mr.
willoughby will do between you about her. ay it is a fine thing to be young and handsome. well i was young once but i never was very handsome worse luck for me. however i got a very good husband and i dont know what the greatest beauty can do more. ah poor man he has been dead these eight years and better. but colonel where have you been to since we parted and how does your business go on elinor now began to make the tea and marianne was obliged to appear again. marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks. the disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen that day. wherever they went she was evidently always on the watch. it was late in the morning before they returned home and no sooner had they entered the house than marianne flew eagerly up stairs and when elinor followed she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance which declared that no willoughby had been there. she replied. the man replied that none had. said she in a low and disappointed voice as she turned away to the window. oh poor souls it was a lucky recollection all her good spirits were restored by it. at this time of the year and after such a series of rain we shall certainly have very little more of it. there seems to me a very decided difference. it was not so yesterday i think. about a week after their arrival it became certain that willoughby was also arrived. his card was on the table when they came in from the mornings drive. but marianne seemed hardly to hear her and on mrs. jenningss entrance escaped with the precious card. this event while it raised the spirits of elinor restored to those of her sister all and more than all their former agitation. she insisted on being left behind the next morning when the others went out. a note was just then brought in and laid on the table. but marianne not convinced took it instantly up. said elinor unable to be longer silent. after a short pause. mrs. jennings soon appeared and the note being given her she read it aloud. he looked at them slightly without seeming to know who they were and merely nodded to mrs. jennings from the other side of the room. replied elinor. and thus ended their discourse. cried marianne. marianne said no more but looked exceedingly hurt. marianne who had seen him from the window and who hated company of any kind left the room before he entered it. i came to inquire but i was convinced before i could ask the question. is every thing finally settled excuse me miss dashwood. at that moment she first perceived him and her whole countenance glowing with sudden delight she would have moved towards him instantly had not her sister caught hold of her. why does he not look at me this however was more than she could believe herself and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of marianne it was beyond her wish. he approached and addressing himself rather to elinor than marianne as if wishing to avoid her eye and determined not to observe her attitude inquired in a hurried manner after mrs. dashwood and asked how long they had been in town. elinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address and was unable to say a word. but the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed. willoughby what is the meaning of this have you not received my letters he could not then avoid it but her touch seemed painful to him and he held her hand only for a moment. what can be the meaning of it tell him i must see him again must speak to him instantly. no my dearest marianne you must wait. my girls were nothing to her and yet they used to be foolish enough but as for miss marianne she is quite an altered creature. how can you talk so dont we all know that it must be a match that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met come come this wont do. because you are so sly about it yourself you think nobody else has any senses but it is no such thing i can tell you for it has been known all over town this ever so long. mrs. jennings laughed again but elinor had not spirits to say more and eager at all events to know what willoughby had written hurried away to their room where on opening the door she saw marianne stretched on the bed almost choked by grief one letter in her hand and two or three others laying by her. with what indignation such a letter as this must be read by miss dashwood may be imagined. oh ah if you knew no friends elinor said no more and turning again to the three letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity than before directly ran over the contents of all. the first which was what her sister had sent him on their arrival in town was to this effect. i wish you may receive this in time to come here      tonight but i will not depend on it. at any rate      i shall expect you tomorrow. i have been expecting      to hear from you and still more to see you every      hour of the day. pray call again as soon as possible      and explain the reason of my having expected this      in vain. you had better come earlier another time      because we are generally out by one. we were last      night at lady middletons where there was a dance. i have been told that you were asked to be of the      party. but could it be so you must be very much      altered indeed since we parted if that could be      the case and you not there. again i demand an explanation      of it. tell me what it is      explain the grounds on which you acted and i shall      be satisfied in being able to satisfy you. that such letters so full of affection and confidence could have been so answered elinor for willoughbys sake would have been unwilling to believe. i know he did. had you seen his look his manner had you heard his voice at that moment have you forgot the last evening of our being together at barton the morning that we parted too i care not who knows that i am wretched. the triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world. but to appear happy when i am so miserable oh again they were both silent. oh willoughby willoughby could this be yours elinor nothing can. whatever he might have heard against me ought he not to have suspended his belief ought he not to have told me of it to have given me the power of clearing myself willoughby where was your heart when you wrote those words who is she who can she be oh i came only for willoughbys sake and now who cares for me the pity of such a woman as lady middleton poor thing she looks very bad. no wonder. ay it is but too true. i have no patience with him. and so i shall always say my dear you may depend on it. i have no notion of mens going on in this way and if ever i meet him again i will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day. well poor thing i wont disturb her any longer for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with. marianne to the surprise of her sister determined on dining with them. elinor even advised her against it. their good friend saw that marianne was unhappy and felt that every thing was due to her which might make her at all less so. lord nothing seems to do her any good. i am sure if i knew of any thing she would like i would send all over the town for it. but when there is plenty of money on one side and next to none on the other lord bless you did you ever see her but the family are all rich together. fifty thousand pounds and by all accounts it wont come before its wanted for they say he is all to pieces. no wonder but now she is of age and may choose for herself and a pretty choice she has made is there nothing one can get to comfort her poor dear it seems quite cruel to let her be alone. well byandby we shall have a few friends and that will amuse her a little. what shall we play at marianne i dare say will not leave her room again this evening. let her name her own supper and go to bed. lord no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two for this matter i suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that. and so the letter that came today finished it poor soul but then you know how should i guess such a thing i made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter and you know young people like to be laughed at about them. lord how concerned sir john and my daughters will be when they hear it lord yes that i do indeed. it must be terrible for you to hear it talked of and as for your sister i am sure i would not mention a word about it to her for the world. you saw i did not all dinner time. for my part i think the less that is said about such things the better the sooner tis blown over and forgot. dont pretend to defend him. he will have her at last aye that he will. lord i hope he will come tonight. it will be all to one a better match for your sister. lord oh tis a nice place to my fancy a thousand times prettier than barton park where they are forced to send three miles for their meat and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother. well i shall spirit up the colonel as soon as i can. and then rising she went away to join marianne whom she found as she expected in her own room leaning in silent misery over the small remains of a fire which till elinors entrance had been her only light. my poor husband how fond he was of it he shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers and with a look which perfectly assured her of his good information inquired after her sister. yes we do know it all. my astonishment but it would be impossible to describe what i felt. but have you likewise heard that miss grey has fifty thousand pounds marianne heard enough. the work of one moment was destroyed by the next. but the letter when she was calm enough to read it brought little comfort. willoughby filled every page. cried elinor. he stopped. a short account of myself i believe will be necessary and it shall be a short one. the same warmth of heart the same eagerness of fancy and spirits. she was married married against her inclination to my brother. and this i fear is all that can be said for the conduct of one who was at once her uncle and guardian. my brother did not deserve her he did not even love her. i have never told you how this was brought on. this however was not the case. elinor affected by his relation and still more by his distress could not speak. he saw her concern and coming to her took her hand pressed it and kissed it with grateful respect. at last however and after i had been six months in england i did find her. but to what does all this lead ah she loved the child and had always kept it with her. i called her a distant relation but i am well aware that i have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her. would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister no he had already done that which no man who can feel for another would do. exclaimed elinor. to suffer you all to be so deceived to see your sister but what could i do on the contrary every friend must be made still more her friend by them. now though at first she will suffer much i am sure she will soon become easier. from all danger of seeing willoughby again her mother considered her to be at least equally safe in town as in the country since his acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends. sir john could not have thought it possible. such a goodnatured fellow he wished him at the devil with all his heart. he would not speak another word to him meet him where he might for all the world mrs. palmer in her way was equally angry. it was a great comfort to her to be sure of exciting no interest in one person at least among their circle of friends a great comfort to know that there was one who would meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars or any anxiety for her sisters health. elinor only was sorry to see them. i was almost sure you would not leave london yet awhile though you told me you know at barton that you should not stay above a month. but i thought at the time that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point. it would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came. and now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone. said i i cannot think who you mean. but such old friends as lucy and me her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed or in her dressing gown and therefore not able to come to them. at last the affair was decided. she turned her eyes towards his face and found him with some surprise to be her brother. elinor found that he and fanny had been in town two days. this morning i had fully intended to call on you if i could possibly find a spare half hour but one has always so much to do on first coming to town. i understand she is a woman of very good fortune. and so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing edward brought us a most charming account of the place the most complete thing of its kind he said that ever was and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing. elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him by the arrival of mrs.
jenningss servant who came to tell her that his mistress waited for them at the door. and there can be no reason why you should not try for him. it is a match that must give universal satisfaction. he has a most excellent mother. i do not mean to complain however it is undoubtedly a comfortable one and i hope will in time be better. i could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands. elinor could only smile. but my dear elinor what is the matter with marianne hers has been a very short one there was something in her style of beauty to please them particularly. i remember fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did not but what she is exceedingly fond of you but so it happened to strike her. she will be mistaken however. they were lucky enough to find lady middleton at home and sir john came in before their visit ended. sir john was ready to like anybody and though mr. dashwood did not seem to know much about horses he soon set him down as a very goodnatured fellow while lady middleton saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his acquaintance worth having and mr. dashwood went away delighted with both. such a woman as i am sure fanny will be glad to know. lady middleton was equally pleased with mrs. dashwood. the intelligence however which she would not give soon flowed from another quarter. lucy came very shortly to claim elinors compassion on being unable to see edward though he had arrived in town with mr.
and mrs. dashwood. elinor was pleased that he had called and still more pleased that she had missed him. they were to meet mrs. ferrars but elinor could not learn whether her sons were to be of the party. on elinor its effect was very different. she hardly knew how she could bear it i declare i can hardly stand. good gracious elinor could not now be made unhappy by this behaviour. john dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing and his wife had still less. marianne could not bear this. who knows or who cares for her mariannes feelings did not stop here. she could say no more her spirits were quite overcome and hiding her face on elinors shoulder she burst into tears. every bodys attention was called and almost every body was concerned. colonel brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did. the chance proved a lucky one for a message from mrs. palmer soon after she arrived carried mrs. jennings away. now was not it so i saw a vast deal more. such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me elinor wished to talk of something else but lucy still pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness and elinor was obliged to go on. you shant talk me out of my satisfaction. i am sure it will all end well and there will be no difficulties at all to what i used to think. mrs. ferrars is a charming woman and so is your sister. they are both delightful women indeed to this elinor had no answer to make and did not attempt any. i should be sorry to have you ill you that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world poor edward they are such charming women lucy continued. i could not have stood it. they all looked exceedingly foolish and edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again as to advance farther into it. they were not only all three together but were together without the relief of any other person. the ladies recovered themselves first. she could therefore only look her tenderness and after slightly addressing him said no more. but elinor had more to do and so anxious was she for his sake and her own to do it well that she forced herself after a moments recollection to welcome him with a look and manner that were almost easy and almost open and another struggle another effort still improved them. her pleasure in seeing him was like every other of her feelings strong in itself and strongly spoken. she met him with a hand that would be taken and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister. edward was the first to speak and it was to notice mariannes altered looks and express his fear of her not finding london agree with her. elinor is well you see. said edward willing to say any thing that might introduce another subject. i expected much pleasure in it but i have found none. she paused no one spoke. poor edward muttered something but what it was nobody knew not even himself. but marianne who saw his agitation and could easily trace it to whatever cause best pleased herself was perfectly satisfied and soon talked of something else. edward it is so and i will say it. what are you never to hear yourself praised said marianne on her leaving them. for their own comfort they would much rather have remained at least all the morning in mrs.
jenningss house but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody. though nothing could be more polite than lady middletons behaviour to elinor and marianne she did not really like them at all. would they only have laughed at her about the doctor the events of this evening were not very remarkable. i advise every body who is going to build to build a cottage. i was to decide on the best of them. and that i fancy will be the end of it. there is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple and where can the supper be fanny was startled at the proposal. but they are lady middletons visitors. they are very well behaved good kind of girls and i think the attention is due to them as their uncle did so very well by edward. mr. dashwood was convinced. my dear miss dashwood but you shall hear it all. and so just as he was going away again it came into my head i am sure i do not know how i happened to think of it but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news. so then it all came out and the long and the short of the matter by all i can learn seems to be this. theres for you my dear could you have believed such a thing possible that is strange i never happened to see them together or i am sure i should have found it out directly. so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride. so up he flew directly and a terrible scene took place for lucy was come to them by that time little dreaming what was going on. poor soul i pity her. mrs. dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house and your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes. i declare i have no patience with your sister and i hope with all my heart it will be a match in spite of her. lord for they say he is monstrous fond of her as well he may. i should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest passion i have no pity for either of them. lord what mrs. ferrars would say and do though there could not be a doubt of its nature she was anxious to hear and still more anxious to know how edward would conduct himself. elinors office was a painful one. but marianne for some time would give credit to neither. at these words mariannes eyes expressed the astonishment which her lips could not utter. cried marianne again. so cheerful my promise to lucy obliged me to be secret. marianne seemed much struck. but i did not love only him and while the comfort of others was dear to me i was glad to spare them from knowing how much i felt. now i can think and speak of it with little emotion. i have many things to support me. you do not suppose that i have ever felt much. for four months marianne i have had all this hanging on my mind without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you yet unable to prepare you for it in the least. i have known myself to be divided from edward for ever without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection. if you can think me capable of ever feeling surely you may suppose that i have suffered now. no marianne. you who have been my only comfort who have borne with me in all my misery who have seemed to be only suffering for me is this my gratitude is this the only return i can make you the next morning brought a farther trial of it in a visit from their brother who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful affair and bring them news of his wife. poor fanny but i would not alarm you too much. she says she never shall think well of anybody again and one cannot wonder at it after being so deceived and now to be so rewarded here he stopped to be thanked which being done he went on. such a suspicion could never have entered her head she was quite in an agony. he came. edward said very little but what he did say was in the most determined manner. i beg your pardon mr.
dashwood but if he had done otherwise i should have thought him a rascal. and to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncles care the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as mrs. ferrars is perhaps altogether a little extraordinary. it is a melancholy consideration. the interest of two thousand pounds how can a man live on it but as it is it must be out of anybodys power to assist him. and there is one thing more preparing against him which must be worse than all his mother has determined with a very natural kind of spirit to settle that estate upon robert immediately which might have been edwards on proper conditions. everybody has a way of their own. marianne got up and walked about the room. poor edward but though confidence between them was by this public discovery restored to its proper state it was not a subject on which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone. she will tell you any thing if you ask. it was lucky however for mrs. jenningss curiosity and elinors too that she would tell any thing without being asked for nothing would otherwise have been learnt. good gracious i have had such a time of it i never saw lucy in such a rage in my life. look she made me this bow to my hat and put in the feather last night. there now you are going to laugh at me too. but why should not i wear pink ribbons i do not care if it is the doctors favourite colour. i am sure for my part i should never have known he did like it better than any other colour if he had not happened to say so. once lucy thought to write to him but then her spirits rose against that. i heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be. and it was entirely for her sake and upon her account that he said a word about being off and not upon his own. but to be sure lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking so she told him directly with a great deal about sweet and love you know and all that oh la one cant repeat such kind of things you know she told him directly she had not the least mind in the world to be off for she could live with him upon a trifle and how little so ever he might have she should be very glad to have it all you know or something of the kind. so then he was monstrous happy and talked on some time about what they should do and they agreed he should take orders directly and they must wait to be married till he got a living. la miss dashwood do you think people make love when any body else is by oh for shame to be sure you must know better than that. i am sorry i did not know it before for i certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself. there is nothing in that. i only stood at the door and heard what i could. and your brother and sister were not very kind however i shant say anything against them to you and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot which was more than i looked for. good gracious i know they will but i am sure i would not do such a thing for all the world. i shall say directly i wonder how you could think of such a thing i had a vast deal more to say to you but i must not stay away from them not any longer. he makes a monstrous deal of money and they keep their own coach. i have not time to speak to mrs. jennings about it myself but pray tell her i am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us and lady middleton the same and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away and mrs. jennings should want company i am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes. goodby i am sorry miss marianne was not here. remember me kindly to her. la then they will have a child every year and lord help em how poor they will be two maids and two men indeed no no they must get a stout girl of all works. though we have suffered      dreadfully we are both quite well now and as happy      as we must always be in one anothers love. aye that was quite proper to let him be off if he would. that was just like lucy. poor soul i wish i could get him a living with all my heart. she calls me dear mrs. jennings you see. very well upon my word. yes yes i will go and see her sure enough. she sighed for the air the liberty the quiet of the country and fancied that if any place could give her ease barton must do it. she cried with great agitation. lord this set the matter beyond a doubt. what had really passed between them was to this effect. have i been rightly informed elinor told him that it was. mrs. ferrars does not know what she may be doing what she may drive her son to. but at the same time she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself. what i am now doing indeed seems nothing at all since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal his only object of happiness. there are not many men who would act as he has done. my dear you are very modest. as to that when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity. but however we may have it all over in the evening for we shall be quite alone. marianne had left the room before the conversation began. one days delay will not be very material and till i have written to mr. ferrars i think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else. i shall do that directly. this speech at first puzzled mrs. jennings exceedingly. i understand you. mr. ferrars is to be the man. well so much the better for him. but my dear is not this rather out of character should not the colonel write himself elinor did not quite understand the beginning of mrs. jenningss speech neither did she think it worth inquiring into and therefore only replied to its conclusion. well that is an odd kind of delicacy however i will not disturb you seeing her preparing to write. i should be very glad to get her so good a mistress. but whether she would do for a ladys maid i am sure i cant tell. how she should begin how she should express herself in her note to edward was now all her concern. her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance. she had not seen him before since his engagement became public and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted with it which with the consciousness of what she had been thinking of and what she had to tell him made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes. mrs. jennings was quite right in what she said. i am charged with a most agreeable office breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke. what edward felt as he could not say it himself it cannot be expected that any one else should say for him. i have had no hand in it. elinor told him the number of the house. did not i do right my dear how calmly you talk of it and can the colonel wait two or three months lord bless me i am sure it would put me quite out of patience and though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor mr. ferrars i do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him. why colonel brandons only object is to be of use to mr. and to you too that had been used to live in barton cottage it seems quite ridiculous. they walked up stairs in to the drawingroom. nobody was there. very far from it indeed. elinor made what excuse she could for her. this living of colonel brandons can it be true has he really given it to edward no connection between them and how came he not to have settled that matter before this persons death now indeed it would be too late to sell it but a man of colonel brandons sense i suppose however on recollection that the case may probably be this. though it is not to be supposed that mrs. ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon for that must be quite out of the question yet why upon her late behaviour is she supposed to feel at all she has done with her son she cast him off for ever and has made all those over whom she had any influence cast him off likewise. elinor was silent. elinor said no more and john was also for a short time silent. but however all that is quite out of the question not to be thought of or mentioned as to any attachment you know it never could be all that is gone by. but i thought i would just tell you of this because i knew how much it must please you. not that you have any reason to regret my dear elinor. there is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well quite as well or better perhaps all things considered. elinor repeated the particulars of it as she had given them to john and their effect on robert though very different was not less striking than it had been on him. it was a look however very well bestowed for it relieved her own feelings and gave no intelligence to him. poor edward he is ruined for ever. you must not judge of him miss dashwood from your slight acquaintance. poor edward his manners are certainly not the happiest in nature. but we are not all born you know with the same powers the same address. poor fellow to see him in a circle of strangers i could not believe it. that was what i said immediately. poor edward but as i directly said to my mother i am not in the least surprised at it from his style of education it was always to be expected. i remember her perfectly. but had i been informed of it a few hours earlier i think it is most probable that something might have been hit on. i certainly should have represented it to edward in a very strong light. i cannot help thinking in short that means might have been found. but now it is all too late. their journey was safely performed. with great surprise therefore did she find herself prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner. their party was small and the hours passed quietly away. nothing was wanting on mrs. palmers side that constant and friendly good humour could do to make them feel themselves welcome. elinor had seen so little of mr. palmer and in that little had seen so much variety in his address to her sister and herself that she knew not what to expect to find him in his own family. marianne was of course kept in ignorance of all these arrangements. it gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of mrs. palmer and as it gave her likewise no concern she never mentioned her name. towards the evening marianne became ill again growing more heavy restless and uncomfortable than before. her sleep though not so quiet as elinor wished to see it lasted a considerable time and anxious to observe the result of it herself she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it. it was no time for hesitation. her fears and her difficulties were immediately before him. not a moment was lost in delay of any kind. it was a night of almost equal suffering to both. her heart was really grieved. she had been for three months her companion was still under her care and she was known to have been greatly injured and long unhappy. elinor catching all and more than all his fears in a moment proposed to call in further advice. but it was too late. elinor could not be cheerful. all within elinors breast was satisfaction silent and strong. the time was now drawing on when colonel brandon might be expected back. the colonel too perhaps scarcely less an object of pity oh how slow was the progress of time which yet kept them in ignorance at seven oclock leaving marianne still sweetly asleep she joined mrs. jennings in the drawingroom to tea. the wind roared round the house and the rain beat against the windows but elinor all happiness within regarded it not. the clock struck eight. she instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her. never in her life had elinor found it so difficult to be calm as at that moment. and of what she had to tell with such knowledge it was impossible to be calm. she rushed to the drawingroom she entered it and saw only willoughby. your business cannot be with me. she hesitated she knew not what to do. but she had promised to hear him and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged. he took the opposite chair and for half a minute not a word was said by either. i heard it from the servant. god be praised but is it true elinor would not speak. he repeated the inquiry with yet greater eagerness. he rose up and walked across the room. for once miss dashwood it will be the last time perhaps let us be cheerful together. elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever. cried elinor more and more at a loss to understand what he would be at. he cried in the same eager tone. but she shall forgive me again and on more reasonable grounds. perhaps you will hardly think the better of me it is worth the trial however and you shall hear every thing. such a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing. but have i ever known it but i have done it. is there a man on earth who could have done it i wish i heartily wish it had never been. but i have injured more than herself and i have injured one whose affection for me may i say it was scarcely less warm than hers and whose mind oh by one measure i might have saved myself. she offered to forgive the past if i would marry eliza. the struggle was great but it ended too soon. i had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife if i chose to address her and i persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do. you were all gone i do not know where. i had left her only the evening before so fully so firmly resolved within my self on doing right oh god they were both silent for a few moments. elinor first spoke. i cannot think of it. it wont do. thank heaven i was miserable. miss dashwood you cannot have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery. well i went left all that i loved and went to those to whom at best i was only indifferent. when i looked back at barton the picture so soothing he stopped. no have you forgot what passed in town remember that you are married. but this note made me know myself better. but every thing was then just settled between miss grey and me. to retreat was impossible. all that i had to do was to avoid you both. you would be surprised to hear how often i watched you how often i was on the point of falling in with you. i have entered many a shop to avoid your sight as the carriage drove by. he asked me to a party a dance at his house in the evening. i could not answer it. i tried but could not frame a sentence. but i thought of her i believe every moment of the day. if you can pity me miss dashwood pity my situation as it was then. with my head and heart full of your sister i was forced to play the happy lover to another woman those three or four weeks were worse than all. well at last as i need not tell you you were forced on me and what a sweet figure i cut what an evening of agony it was marianne beautiful as an angel on one side calling me willoughby in such a tone oh god such an evening i ran away from you all as soon as i could but not before i had seen mariannes sweet face as white as death. that was the last last look i ever had of her the last manner in which she appeared to me. it was a horrid sight yet when i thought of her today as really dying it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that i knew exactly how she would appear to those who saw her last in this world. your sister wrote to me again you know the very next morning. you saw what she said. she read what made her wretched. but what could i do day it must have been only to one end. you had made your own choice. it was not forced on you. she must be attached to you or she would not have married you. she knew i had no regard for her when we married. and now do you pity me miss dashwood or have i said all this to no purpose am i be it only one degree am i less guilty in your opinion than i was before my intentions were not always wrong. you have proved your heart less wicked much less wicked. my resolution was soon made and at eight oclock this morning i was in my carriage. elinor made no answer. he held out his hand. she could not refuse to give him hers he pressed it with affection. domestic happiness is out of the question. if however i am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions it may be the means it may put me on my guard at least it may be something to live for. marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever. and with these words he almost ran out of the room. but she felt that it was so long long before she could feel his influence less. elinors heart was full. he shared it however in a silence even greater than her own. my elinor you do not yet know all my happiness. colonel brandon loves marianne. could he have seen her happy with another such a noble mind what answer did you give him my love i could not then talk of hope to him or to myself. marianne might at that moment be dying. time a very little time i tell him will do everything mariannes heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as willoughby. there however he is quite mistaken. and his person his manners too are all in his favour. she paused. poor elinor to elinor the observation of the latter was particularly grateful. that would not do. i know we shall be happy. i know the summer will pass happily away. i have formed my plan and am determined to enter on a course of serious study. willing therefore to delay the evil hour she resolved to wait till her sisters health were more secure before she appointed it. but the resolution was made only to be broken. marianne had been two or three days at home before the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out. elinor tenderly invited her to be open. i do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been for him but what they are now. elinor said no more. had i died in what peculiar misery should i have left you my nurse my friend my sister how should i have lived in your remembrance my mother too every body seemed injured by me. to john to fanny yes even to them little as they deserve i had given less than their due. i and only i knew your heart and its sorrows yet to what did it influence me not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself. the future must be my proof. as for willoughby to say that i shall soon or that i shall ever forget him would be idle. marianne said not a word. but the feelings of the past could not be recalled. i never could have been happy with him after knowing as sooner or later i must have known all this. i should have had no confidence no esteem. with one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends and the best of men no my marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man had you married you must have been always poor. and why does he regret it because he finds it has not answered towards himself. it has not made him happy. but does it follow that had he married you he would have been happy her daughter did not look however as if much of it were heard by her. she had heard nothing of him since her leaving london nothing new of his plans nothing certain even of his present abode. the servant who saw only that miss marianne was taken ill had sense enough to call one of the maids who with mrs. dashwoods assistance supported her into the other room. she smiled and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts. elinors heart could easily account for his not putting himself forward and mrs. dashwood probably found the same explanation. mrs. dashwood now looked at her daughter but elinor knew better than to expect them. thomass intelligence seemed over. elinor looked as if she wished to hear more. marianne had already sent to say that she should eat nothing more. what had edward felt on being within four miles from barton on seeing her mothers servant on hearing lucys message though uncertain that any one were to blame she found fault with every absent friend. was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on. this was gaining something something to look forward to. colonel brandon must have some information to give. scarcely had she so determined it when the figure of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window. it was a gentleman it was colonel brandon himself. now she could hear more and she trembled in expectation of it. but it was not colonel brandon neither his air nor his height. were it possible she must say it must be edward. she looked again. she moved away and sat down. in a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the mistake. they all waited in silence for the appearance of their visitor. his countenance as he entered the room was not too happy even for elinor. elinors lips had moved with her mothers and when the moment of action was over she wished that she had shaken hands with him too. but it was then too late and with a countenance meaning to be open she sat down again and talked of the weather. it was put an end to by mrs. dashwood who felt obliged to hope that he had left mrs. ferrars very well. another pause. he replied with an air of surprise. she dared not look up but her mother and marianne both turned their eyes on him. elinor could sit it no longer. she almost ran out of the room and as soon as the door was closed burst into tears of joy which at first she thought would never cease. his errand at barton in fact was a simple one. marianne could speak her happiness only by tears. but elinor how are her feelings to be described she repeated it to edward. he put the letter into elinors hands. in a sister it is bad enough but in a wife how i have blushed over the pages of her writing elinor smiled and shook her head. now he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place. about four days after edwards arrival colonel brandon appeared to complete mrs. dashwoods satisfaction and to give her the dignity of having for the first time since her living at barton more company with her than her house would hold. poor mr. edward i am grown very happy but that would not interest. he agreed that he might. but i confess it would give me great pleasure to call colonel brandon brother. his property here his place his house every thing is in such respectable and excellent condition and his woods that was due to the folly of robert and the cunning of his wife and it was earned by them before many months had passed away. what immediately followed is known. it was now her darling object. marianne dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate. but so it was. you will soon admit as much as i need from you. they taught you that but wait a moment. . . it is only another way of looking at time. but some foolish people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. yesterday it was so high yesterday night it fell then this morning it rose again and so gently upward to here. right and left we can go backward and forward freely enough and men always have done so. but how about up and down that is just where the whole world has gone wrong. we are always getting away from the present moment. but you are wrong to say that we cannot move about in time. i jump back for a moment. of course we have no means of staying back for any length of time any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. then he drew up a chair and sat down. it is my plan for a machine to travel through time. have a good look at the thing. there was a breath of wind and the lamp flame jumped. save for the lamp the table was bare. everyone was silent for a minute. at that the time traveller laughed cheerfully. we stared at each other. you can explain that. i should have thought of it. then the time traveller asked us what we thought of it all. is that plain things that would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands. it is a mistake to do things too easily. but how the trick was done he could not explain. the medical man was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his watch in the other. its rather odd. i gave a cry of surprise. then he came into the room. we stared at him in silence expecting him to speak. the time traveller did not seem to hear. his eyes grew brighter and a faint colour came into his cheeks. then he spoke again still as it were feeling his way among his words. the editor began a question. then the door closed upon him. the dinner was resumed. he smiled quietly in his old way. thanks. the rest of the dinner was uncomfortable. for my own part sudden questions kept on rising to my lips and i dare say it was the same with the others. at last the time traveller pushed his plate away and looked round us. i want to tell it. badly. most of it will sound like lying. so be it then i shall go to bed. he sat back in his chair at first and spoke like a weary man. you cannot know how his expression followed the turns of his story at first we glanced now and again at each other. after a time we ceased to do that and looked only at the time travellers face. had anything happened the night came like the turning out of a lamp and in another moment came tomorrow. tomorrow night came black then day again night again day again faster and faster still. i was still on the hillside upon which this house now stands and the shoulder rose above me grey and dim. even through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair. and so my mind came round to the business of stopping. everything still seemed grey but presently i remarked that the confusion in my ears was gone. i looked round me. in a moment i was wet to the skin. i stood up and looked round me. but all else of the world was invisible. what might not have happened to men i felt naked in a strange world. it struck my chin violently. they had seen me and their faces were directed towards me. noticing that i noticed for the first time how warm the air was. i took my hands from the machine. he came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes. the absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at once. one of them addressed me. so i shook my head and pointing to my ears shook it again. he came a step forward hesitated and then touched my hand. they wanted to make sure i was real. but i made a sudden motion to warn them when i saw their little pink hands feeling at the time machine. i pointed to the time machine and to myself. the question had come into my mind abruptly were these creatures fools you may hardly understand how it took me. a flow of disappointment rushed across my mind. for a moment i felt that i had built the time machine in vain. then came one laughing towards me carrying a chain of beautiful flowers altogether new to me and put it about my neck. there were perhaps a couple of hundred people dining in the hall and most of them seated as near to me as they could come were watching me with interest their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating. clearly that was the next thing to do. apparently the single house and possibly even the household had vanished. it may seem strange perhaps that i had not noticed this before. but everything was so strange. now i saw the fact plainly enough. it was as sweet and fair a view as i have ever seen. one triumph of a united humanity over nature had followed another. and the harvest was what i saw it was natural on that golden evening that i should jump at the idea of a social paradise. for after the battle comes quiet. that would account for the abandoned ruins. i determined to descend and find where i could sleep. i looked at the lawn again. can you imagine what i felt as this conviction came home to me but you cannot. the time machine was gone i could feel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing. my breath came with pain. and i am not a young man. i cried aloud and none answered. not a trace of the thing was to be seen. it had moved and was hid only in space. but then where could it be the big hall was dark silent and deserted. i lit a match and went on past the dusty curtains of which i have told you. for they had forgotten about matches. it must have been very queer to them. i do not remember all i did as the moon crept up the sky. i had nothing left but misery. then things came clear in my mind. with the plain reasonable daylight i could look my circumstances fairly in the face. suppose the worst i said. and after all it was a beautiful and curious world. i had exhausted my emotion. it was as i think i have said of bronze. one thing was clear enough to my mind. but how it got there was a different problem. they went off as if they had received the last possible insult. somehow his manner made me feel ashamed of myself. but as you know i wanted the time machine and i tried him once more. as he turned off like the others my temper got the better of me. at last hot and tired i sat down to watch the place. patience said i to myself. face this world. although it was at my own expense i could not help myself. i laughed aloud. one lay by the path up the hill which i had followed during my first walk. it was an obvious conclusion but it was absolutely wrong. yet we at least should be willing enough to explain these things to him yet i could think of no other. let me put my difficulties. somehow such things must be made. i could not see how things were kept going. why for the life of me i could not imagine. well on the third day of my visit that was how the world of eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one presented itself to me a little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round and i had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before i left her. in that however i was wrong. the thing took my imagination. very possibly i had been feeling desolate. we passed each other flowers and she kissed my hands. i did the same to hers. she wanted to be with me always. nevertheless she was somehow a very great comfort. nor until it was too late did i clearly understand what she was to me. but she dreaded the dark dreaded shadows dreaded black things. darkness to her was the one thing dreadful. i never found one out of doors or one sleeping alone within doors after dark. it must have been the night before her rescue that i was awakened about dawn. i tried to get to sleep again but i felt restless and uncomfortable. and up the hill i thought i could see ghosts. they moved hastily. i did not see what became of them. it seemed that they vanished among the bushes. i cannot account for it. i was afraid to turn. then the thought of the absolute security in which humanity appeared to be living came to my mind. and then i remembered that strange terror of the dark. i put out my hand and touched something soft. at once the eyes darted sideways and something white ran past me. but as i say it went too fast for me to see distinctly. after an instants pause i followed it into the second heap of ruins. a sudden thought came to me. it made me shudder. it was so like a human spider then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my hand going out as it dropped and when i had lit another the little monster had disappeared. but they were interested by my matches and i struck some to amuse them. i tried them again about the well and again i failed. so presently i left them meaning to go back to weena and see what i could get from her. my explanation may be absolutely wrong. that i could see clearly enough already. for i felt sure it was they who had taken it. and why were they so terribly afraid of the dark at first she would not understand my questions and presently she refused to answer them. they were the only tears except my own i ever saw in that golden age. yet i could not face the mystery. if only i had had a companion it would have been different. i dont know if you will understand my feeling but i never felt quite safe at my back. at first she watched me in amazement. for a moment i hung by one hand and after that experience i did not dare to rest again. but even while i turned this over in my mind i continued to descend. it was not too soon. the view i had of it was as much as one could see in the burning of a match. i fancied i heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little beings about me. i shouted at them as loudly as i could. they started away and then i could feel them approaching me again. they clutched at me more boldly whispering odd sounds to each other. this time they were not so seriously alarmed and they made a queer laughing noise as they came back at me. i had the greatest difficulty in keeping my hold. i fell upon my face. even the soil smelt sweet and clean. before i had felt as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it. now i felt like a beast in a trap whose enemy would come upon him soon. it was the darkness of the new moon. it was not now such a very difficult problem to guess what the coming dark nights might mean. i tried to recall the form of it. i had a vague sense of something familiar but i could not tell what it was at the time. i at least would defend myself. i felt i could never sleep again until my bed was secure from them. i shuddered with horror to think how they must already have examined me. you know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk to me there is always an air of expectation about that evening stillness. well that night the expectation took the colour of my fears. and why had they taken my time machine the clear blue of the distance faded and one star after another came out. the ground grew dim and the trees black. then as the darkness grew deeper she put her arms round my neck and closing her eyes tightly pressed her face against my shoulder. i hesitated at this. i could see no end to it either to the right or the left. the hillside was quiet and deserted but from the black of the wood there came now and then a stir of living things. above me shone the stars for the night was very clear. i felt a certain sense of friendly comfort in their twinkling. then i thought of the great fear that was between the two species and for the first time with a sudden shiver came the clear knowledge of what the meat i had seen might be. yet it was too horrible indeed i had seen none upon the hill that night. we soon met others of the dainty ones laughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as the night. and then i thought once more of the meat that i had seen. i tried to look at the thing in a scientific spirit. why should i trouble myself and there was weena dancing at my side but this attitude of mind was impossible. that necessity was immediate. weena i had resolved to bring with me to our own time. she always seemed to me i fancy more human than she was perhaps because her affection was so human. the place was very silent. as for the rest of the contents of that gallery though on the whole they were the best preserved of all i saw i had little interest. so suddenly that she startled me. then i saw that the gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness. i called to mind that it was already far advanced in the afternoon and that i had still no weapon no refuge and no means of making a fire. but it was impossible somehow to feel any humanity in the things. very eagerly i tried them. they were perfectly good. they were not even damp. i turned to weena. dance i cried to her in her own tongue. for now i had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared. i could not carry both however and my bar of iron promised best against the bronze gates. then came a doubt. i hesitated. towards sunset i began to consider our position. but that troubled me very little now. in the morning there was the getting of the time machine. i laughed at that and turned again to the dark trees before me. i lit none of my matches because i had no hand free. upon my left arm i carried my little one in my right hand i had my iron bar. but to get one i must put her down. soft little hands too were creeping over my coat and back touching even my neck. then i looked at weena. with a sudden fright i stooped to her. she seemed scarcely to breathe. the wood behind seemed full of the stir and murmur of a great company i had to think rapidly what to do. i lit a match and as i did so two white forms that had been approaching weena dashed hastily away. presently i noticed how dry was some of the foliage above me for since my arrival on the time machine a matter of a week no rain had fallen. i could not even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed. i seemed just to nod and open my eyes. in a moment i knew what had happened. the forest seemed full of the smell of burning wood. i was caught by the neck by the hair by the arms and pulled down. it gave me strength. i struggled up shaking the human rats from me and holding the bar short i thrust where i judged their faces might be. i stood with my back to a tree swinging the iron bar before me. the whole wood was full of the stir and cries of them. a minute passed. yet none came within reach. then suddenly came hope. and close on the heels of that came a strange thing. it was my first fire coming after me. with that i looked for weena but she was gone. it was a close race. this whole space was as bright as day with the reflection of the fire. i was thinking of beginning the fight by killing some of them before this should happen but the fire burst out again brightly and i stayed my hand. but weena was gone. i bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. i beat the ground with my hands and got up and sat down again and wandered here and there and again sat down. then i would fall to rubbing my eyes and calling upon god to let me awake. it was plain that they had left her poor little body in the forest. now in this old familiar room it is more like the sorrow of a dream than an actual loss. the gay robes of the beautiful people moved hither and thither among the trees. very pleasant was their day as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field. like the cattle they knew of no enemies and provided against no needs. and their end was the same. once life and property must have reached almost absolute safety. and a great quiet had followed. there is no intelligence where there is no change and no need of change. and when other meat failed them they turned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden. so i say i saw it in my last view of the world of eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one. i threw my iron bar away almost sorry not to use it. very calmly i tried to strike the match. one touched me. then came one hand upon me and then another. one indeed they almost got away from me. the clinging hands slipped from me. the darkness presently fell from my eyes. this puzzled me very much at first. all trace of the moon had vanished. the earth had come to rest with one face to the sun even as in our own time the moon faces the earth. the sky was no longer blue. i tried to brush it away with my hand but in a moment it returned and almost immediately came another by my ear. it was drawn swiftly out of my hand. but i was still on the same beach and i saw them distinctly now as soon as i stopped. but i saw nothing moving in earth or sky or sea. i saw this grow larger. silent in another moment the pale stars alone were visible. the sky was absolutely black. i got off the machine to recover myself. i breathed with greater freedom. these too changed and passed and others came. for several minutes i trembled violently. i might have slept there and the whole thing have been a dream. you know the rest. i cannot expect you to believe it. i took my eyes off the time travellers face and looked round at his audience. they were in the dark and little spots of colour swam before them. the others as far as i remember were motionless. the editor stood up with a sigh. the medical man rose came to the lamp and examined the flowers. the time traveller put his hand to his head. this room and you and the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory. did i ever make a time machine or a model of a time machine or is it all only a dream its madness. and where did the dream come from we followed him. he came into the hall with us and helped the editor on with his coat. i shared a cab with the editor. i lay awake most of the night thinking about it. i determined to go next day and see the time traveller again. i came back through the corridor. he was coming from the house. he laughed when he saw me and gave me an elbow to shake. he hesitated. his eye wandered about the room. i got up and went down the passage to tell the time traveller. the time traveller was not there. the time machine had gone. i knew that something strange had happened and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange thing might be. we looked at each other. then ideas began to come. no one has come out this way. the time traveller vanished three years ago. and as everybody knows now he has never returned. will he ever return i say for my own part. if that is so it remains for us to live as though it were not so. chapter i.
the discovery of america. across the dusk with bowed head came a woman. he is willing to work but i have nothing to do in his      line. times as you know are dull and in his own profession      nothing seems to be doing. everything he has ever discovered has remained that way so he is      willing to let his work show for itself. he had taken orders on the store till he was tired of it. a few weeks later he had saved one hundred and fifty dollars in this way. why discover a place when it is so far out of the way why discover at great expense an entirely new country he then set out sailing due west over an unknown sea to blaze the way for liberty. soon however his men began to murmur. was heard and america was discovered. thus we see that the great are not always happy. he had genius and was also a married man. he also pulled considerable grass in his search for gold. see the look of anguish. the spanish discovered the water mostly and england the ice belonging to north america. why i am an indian. by s. bull. chapter iii. this chapter is given up almost wholly to facts. she never touched them. her husband sprang from her also just in time. thus one after another the indians went away. by writing a letter and getting a reply to it he made another hit. some were killed by the indians while returning from their club at evening some became pirates. where is that laughter now they are gone. the author. it was a solemn moment. how to jolly the red man out of his lands. by ernest smith. the female red man and her pure life. by me. where is my indian to night chapter iv. during the winter they discovered why the lands had been sold to them so low. possibly the reader has considered the matter already. he also was the first to utter the idea that a mans own conscience must be his own guide and not that of another. does the man look cheerful no. no one looks cheerful. even the little boys look sad. freedom is a good thing. at this time there was a line of battle three hundred miles in length. this was naturally difficult. human nature is the same even to this day. soon after this the pequod war broke out. there has never been a prosperous pequod lodge since. they had no other law. the discovery of new york. new york was afterwards sold for twentyfour dollars the whole island. where were they when new york was sold for twentyfour dollars twentyfour dollars for new york ah whom have we here but we are speaking of the discovery of new york. you would not have been happy here now. he went back on board the city of rome one day and did not return. oh how he must have felt suddenly a thought came to him. he then drank another. had he been born in america he might have been alive yet. i will not go over them again. it has been some years now however since that has happened in this country. he is that way down to the present day. in three years it had gained more than new york had in fifty years. george ii. virginia dare was the first white child born in america. king williams war lasted eight years. no answer was ever received. no one would have felt it and possibly it might have saved the lives of innocent people. he started at once. he liked it very much. after that washington took command whenever he could and soon rose to be a great man. later we show him as he appeared after he had abandoned his original plans and immediately after not taking washingtons advice. he spent most of his time building roads. many other changes were going on at this time. some of them changed their names and moved. he then went back to see how his rear was and finding it all right he went back still farther to see if no one had been left behind. in that way he missed it himself. i would hate to miss a fight that way. came the reply. he heard some one say. these were the people whose children we are. it would seem that a few personal remarks about george washington at this point might not be out of place. later on his part in this history will more fully appear. but george washington was not perfect. that was one of his weak points and no doubt he was ashamed of it as he ought to have been. george washington was always ready. if you wanted a man to be first in war you could call on george. though he was a great man he was once a poor boy. how often you hear that in america in conclusion let me say that george washington was successful for three reasons. one was that he never shook the confidence of his friends. another was that he had a strong will without being a mule. some people cannot distinguish between being firm and being a big blue donkey. the british shoe is said to be more comfortable. church services meant business in those days. he fed and clothed everybody black or white who lived on the estate and waited patiently for the colored people to do his work and keep well so that they would be more valuable. his prayer has been answered. scarcely. troops were now sent to restore order. the fight however was brief. a party made up as indians and going on board threw the tea overboard. george iii. or some such remark as that. the americans hated to do that so they did not. the americans were driven from the field but it was a victory after all. however the suggestion was not acted on. he was then regarded as a great man and almost every one took his paper. they thought a good deal of him in paris and offered him a corner lot if he would build there and start a paper. on his arrival at boston there were only fourteen thousand men. we love our country sir whether we love anything else much or not. he composed the piece one evening after his other work. it was a day long to be remembered and one that made george iii. there was no north then no south no east no west just one common country with washington acting as father of same. oh how nice it must have been washington was one of the sweetest men in the united states. he gave his hand in marriage to a widow woman who had two children and a dark red farm in virginia. the beginning of the end. the battle was brief. the americans lost one thousand men by death or capture. washington lost only four men and two of those were frozen to death. the english had not been so successful in the north. the enemy was thus driven to camp. otherwise they resembled each other. he was a brave man and never knew in battle what fear was. yet strange to say a bat in his bed would make him start up and turn pale. he had only two troops left at the close of the battle and they could not keep up with gates in the retreat. unhappy man they found papers on his person among them a copy of punch which made them suspicious that he was not an american and so he was tried and hanged as a spy. one day his father discovered that the trees had been cut down and spoke of it to the lad. it was heavily in debt with no power to raise money. the first president. everybody tried to make it pleasant for him. he could get on a horse at his door and in five minutes be out of sight. as a boy he was well behaved and a careful student. he was not invited however to come to the house during his stay and the queen did not call on mrs. jay. we should learn from this to be humble even when we are in authority. he also murdered the sick in their beds. the advance of the republic. yet this experience has not been regarded by the people as it should have been. on receiving the money a trunk attached by our government and belonging to napoleon was released. he was not recognized and so tried to capture the seat while the regular governor was at tea. the motion was lost. in eighteen months one hundred thousand people went to the scene. many married men went who had been looking a long time for some good place to go to. some came back and carried water for their wives to wash clothing for their neighbors. it was a long hard trip then across the plains. he says he would not do it again for anything. i do not know what we should learn from this. when the country has wanted a man to talk well on these subjects it has generally been compelled to advance money to him before he could make a speech. this has been a severe winter on red shirt and i have to guard against the night air a good deal myself. it is a great book. he has introduced too many characters into his book at the expense of the plot. he doesnt keep up the interest. a friend of mine at sing sing who secured one of my books said he never left his room till he had devoured it. i have discovered in some of his later books one hundred and eighteen thousand words no two of which are alike. those who examine this tale will readily see why there were no flies on the author. he kept them off with this tale. it is a good book as i say to take up for a moment or to read on the train or to hold the door open on a hot day. but the boy said he didnt mind a little thing like that. a good many people do not know this but it is true. then she would have called james out from under the bed and allowed him to come to the table for his meals with the family. but he was not married and the war came on. its all owing to how a man was brought up. advance. the fighting here was not severe. washington was getting too hot now to hold people who could get away. it was hard to say which capital had been scared the worst. we should always know as nearly as possible whether our orders come from the proper authority or not. oh how sad everything seemed at that time to the north and how high cotton cloth was still it took two more years to close the war. the north now began to sit up and take notice. morning papers began to sell once more and grant was the name on every tongue. lee felt so good over this that he decided to go north and get something to eat. yet they moved onward. last year of the disagreeable war. air general banks obtained quite a relief at this time he was relieved of his command. at the south at this time coffee was fifty dollars a pound and gloves were one hundred and fifty dollars a pair. money was plenty but what was needed seemed to be confidence. he had gone away. let us not dwell on the particulars. one million men lost their lives. was it worth while too much liberty in places and not enough elsewhere. he little dreamed that the time would come when we should have more liberty than we could pay for. it seems to me that we have too much liberty in this country in some ways. we have more liberty than we have money. almost every one can have a good deal of fun in america except the american. but what do we want of liberty anyhow what could we do with it if we had it it takes a man of leisure to enjoy liberty and we have no leisure whatever. it is a good thing to keep in the house for the use of guests but we dont need it for ourselves. we are used to it and we rather like it. he is worse than the man who cannot forgive or forget. he is getting ready to ask a favor. who will tell us what he had to do with it a person jumping from it is not always killed. the same year the civil service bill became a law. still he should be just as faithful to his trust as he would be if he were nearer the throne. the end. the skin horse had lived longer in the nursery than any of the others. asked the rabbit. it takes a long time. said the rabbit. but the skin horse only smiled. the rabbit sighed. he thought it would be a long time before this magic called real happened to him. he longed to become real to know what it felt like and yet the idea of growing shabby and losing his eyes and whiskers was rather sad. he wished that he could become it without these uncomfortable things happening to him. the rabbit didnt mind it so much for wherever he was thrown he came down soft. one evening when the boy was going to bed he couldnt find the china dog that always slept with him. and she dragged the rabbit out by one ear and put him into the boys arms. and he missed too those long moonlight hours in the nursery when all the house was silent and his talks with the skin horse. spring came and they had long days in the garden for wherever the boy went the rabbit went too. and once when the boy was called away suddenly to go out to tea the rabbit was left out on the lawn until long after dusk and nana had to come and look for him with the candle because the boy couldnt go to sleep unless he was there. she said. the boy sat up in bed and stretched out his hands. he said. when the little rabbit heard that he was happy for he knew that what the skin horse had said was true at last. he was real. the boy himself had said it. that was a wonderful summer but he couldnt see it. they were evidently a new kind of rabbit altogether. summer days 
they stared at him and the little rabbit stared back. one of them asked. he said. said the little rabbit. he meant when the boy threw him but of course he didnt want to say so. he said again. but the wild rabbits have very sharp eyes. and this one stretched out his neck and looked. he called out. and he began to laugh. cried the little rabbit. said the wild rabbit. the strange rabbit stopped dancing and came quite close. he exclaimed. said the little rabbit. and he nearly began to cry. just then there was a sound of footsteps and the boy ran past near them and with a stamp of feet and a flash of white tails the two strange rabbits disappeared. called the little rabbit. he thought. weeks passed and the little rabbit grew very old and shabby but the boy loved him just as much. he even began to lose his shape and he scarcely looked like a rabbit any more except to the boy. to him he was always beautiful and that was all that the little rabbit cared about. and then one day the boy was ill.
his face grew very flushed and he talked in his sleep and his little body was so hot that it burned the rabbit when he held him close. it was a long weary time for the boy was too ill to play and the little rabbit found it rather dull with nothing to do all day long. all sorts of delightful things he planned and while the boy lay half asleep he crept up close to the pillow and whispered them in his ear. and presently the fever turned and the boy got better. and one day they let him get up and dress. it was a bright sunny morning and the windows stood wide open. everything was arranged and now it only remained to carry out the doctors orders. thought the little rabbit. just then nana caught sight of him. she asked. said the doctor. what nonsense get him a new one. he thought of the skin horse so wise and gentle and all that he had told him. of what use was it to be loved and lose ones beauty and become real if it all ended like this and then a strange thing happened. for where the tear had fallen a flower grew out of the ground a mysterious flower not at all like any that grew in the garden. it was so beautiful that the little rabbit forgot to cry and just lay there watching it. and presently the blossom opened and out of it there stepped a fairy. the rabbit looked up at her and it seemed to him that he had seen her face before but he couldnt think where. asked the little rabbit. the fairy flower 
and she held the little rabbit close in her arms and flew with him into the wood. it was light now for the moon had risen. and she kissed the little rabbit again and put him down on the grass. she said. but the little rabbit sat quite still for a moment and never moved. for when he saw all the wild rabbits dancing around him he suddenly remembered about his hind legs and he didnt want them to see that he was made all in one piece. he did not know that when the fairy kissed him that last time she had changed him altogether. and he found that he actually had hind legs he was a real rabbit at last at home with the other rabbits. at last at last autumn passed and winter and in the spring when the days grew warm and sunny the boy went out to play in the wood behind the house. said lionel who had often been out to tea. the grave gentlemen led the way to a coach with eight white horses which was drawn up in front of the house where lionel lived. it was no. i wish id let you do the other ear. no theres no time now. so off went lionel to be made a king. he had never expected to be a king any more than you have so it was all quite new to him so new that he had never even thought of it. and as the coach went through the town he had to bite his tongue to be quite sure it was real because if his tongue was real it showed he wasnt dreaming. he was a little sorry at first that he had not put on his best clothes but he soon forgot to think about that. he was a strange man a very good king he was but he had his faults he was fond of books. so lionel went down into the library. i love to read. said lionel quickly. asked lionel cheerfully. lionel looked puzzled. but before he had spoken the king had turned the next page and there was a shining bird complete and beautiful in every blue feather of him. then the prime minister snatched the book away from the king and shut it up on the blank page where the bird had been and put it on a very high shelf. and was very angry indeed. thats the question. but when lionel was in bed he could not sleep for thinking of the book and when the full moon was shining with all her might and light he got up and crept down to the library and climbed up and got the book of beasts. the dragon did not move and the king shut up the book rather quickly and went back to bed. and then lionel felt that he had indeed done it. he had not been king twentyfour hours and already he had let loose a red dragon to worry his faithful subjects lives out. and they had been saving up so long to buy him a crown and everything lionel began to cry. everyone did what they could. so lionel put on his crown and sat on his throne and said he wanted to make some laws. then he made a law that everyone should always have enough to eat. and this pleased everyone except the ones who had always had too much. now the next day was saturday. lionel did his best to be a good king during the week and the people were beginning to forgive him for letting the dragon out of the book. lionel was very very unhappy. the question was what so he took the book of beasts out into the rose garden and opened the page next to the one where the dragon had been just a tiny bit to see what the name was. asked the king. he is yellow with the body of a lion and the face of a man. things were growing very serious. you see he was very hot to begin with. then the king cried for six days and on the seventh he was so tired that he had to stop. nurse washed his face and told him not to be a silly little king. now nurse dear i know im right so kiss me in case i never come back. so off he went. the blue bird sang more sweetly than ever and the butterfly shone more brightly as lionel once more carried the book of beasts out into the rose garden and opened it very quickly so that he might not be afraid and change his mind. and the blue birds song was very loud and sweet. and he knew at once what he must do. he was getting very hot indeed parts of him even had begun to smoke. he knew that he must certainly catch fire in another minute unless he could get under a tree. he cried. you see it was impossible for the dragon to take them into the book with him it was a tight fit even for one dragon so of course he had to leave them outside. they all got home somehow and all lived happy ever after. of course he knew his way onto his own page so there was no danger of his opening the book at the wrong page and letting out a dragon or anything. ii. asked the gardeners boy. she was always kind and polite even to her uncle james and to other people whom she did not like very much and though she was not very clever for a princess she always tried to do her lessons. even if you know perfectly well that you cant do your lessons you may as well try and sometimes you find that by some fortunate accident they really are done. just as if she didnt know. but in case you are not a thoughtful child and it is just possible of course that you are not i will tell you at once what that most remarkable thing was. and this was how it happened. i cant tell you how big he was. even if you think of elephants it will not help you at all. tom had learned more at school than anyone else because he wished to take a prize. but after that day when the princess said she meant to marry tom the gardeners boy thought it over and he decided that the best prize in the world would be the princess and this was the prize tom meant to take and when you are a gardeners son and have decided to marry a princess you will find that the more you learn at school the better. he was the dearest little elephant you ever saw about six inches long. but he was very very wise he could not have been wiser if he had been a mile high. and besides the dog did bark so terribly. and when he barked his bark was so large that it filled up all the night and left no room for sleep or dreams or polite conversation or anything else at all. it was quite in the middle of the island and stuck up ever so far and when you were at the top you could see a great deal farther than when you were not. he did not go very near the rabbits of course because when a rabbit of that size is at play it does not always look where it is going and it might easily have crushed tom with its foot and then it would have been very sorry afterward. and tom was a kind boy and would not have liked to make even a rabbit unhappy. they too have kind hearts and they would not like you to be sorry afterward. so tom went on looking at the rabbits and watching the morning grow more and more red and golden. tom saw at once what had happened. the dragon shook his large purple head. he could not speak but like all other animals he could understand well enough when he liked. asked tom politely. the dragon opened his purple eyes with an inquiring smile. lets all go and see the dragon. so they went. but of course nobody heard him except the princesss uncle and he was a magician and accustomed to listening at doors. it was part of his trade. and when anyone is a magician and is also an uncle and is named james as well you need not expect anything nice from him. uncle james had long wanted to get rid of the princess and have the kingdom to himself. now however uncle james thought there might be a chance for him because he knew that now there were two wicked people on the island who could stand by each other himself and the dragon. tom went home and told his elephant all about it. then tom understood. all right. and he was. and the dragons laugh was not a merry one. then too little things began to be missed. and you know how unpleasant that is even in a private school and in a public kingdom it is of course much worse. it was nothing much as i say but it made people feel uncomfortable. he had barked ever since the dragon came to the island and people had grown quite used to the noise. so when his barking suddenly ceased it woke everybody up and they all went out to see what was the matter. a boy was sent to wake the army so that it might look for him. but the army was gone too and now the people began to be frightened. then uncle james came out onto the terrace of the palace and he made the people a speech. everyone thought of the rabbit named frederick and groaned. everyone thought of the poor army. he is accustomed to have a present on his birthday. what the dragon wants is a princess. the crowd began to cry for they loved their princess though they quite saw that their first duty was to be generous and give the poor dragon what it wanted. the princess began to cry for she did not want to be anybodys birthday present especially a purple dragons. and tom began to cry because he was so angry. he went straight home and told his little elephant and the elephant cheered him up so much that presently the two grew quite absorbed in a top that the elephant was spinning with his little trunk. early in the morning tom went to the palace. said the princess. then tom told her what she was to do. and she kissed him again and again. you two have saved me. and im glad to see youre not crying. you know my child we cannot begin too young to learn to think of the happiness of others rather than our own. the princess said she would try not to be selfish. we have brought you a small present for your birthday. our means are small but our hearts are large. the princess said she supposed so and the dragon came a little nearer. uncle james was furious. we cant go back on our word like this. give a thing and take a thing why its never done. you see he was so long he could not turn as quickly as she could. this annoyed the dragon so much that he put out all his strength spread his great purple wings and tried to fly at her. it spun so fast that everyone fell flat on their faces and held on tight to themselves because they felt something was going to happen. and something did happen. and the dragon took him because it wanted a birthday present. you remember tom promised to give him back to the princess when they were married. because you see the princess and the gardeners son were so fond of each other they could not help being happy and besides they had an elephant of their very own to ride on. if that is not enough to make people happy i should like to know what is. though of course i know there are some people who could not be happy unless they had a whale to sail on and perhaps not even then. iii. effie rubbed and cried not real crying but the kind your eye does all by itself without your being miserable inside your mind and then she went to her father to have the thing in her eye taken out. he had never before thought it curious. people always say this when they have had something in their eyes. effie had never heard her father say that about anything that she had any share in. the professor leaned forward before the doctor could say a word. and effie was right. they all looked alike except as to size. of course the county council and the police did everything that could be done it was no use offering the hand of the princess to anyone who killed a dragon. and yet there seemed to be as many dragons as ever. and yet there seemed to be more dragons than ever. and yet there seemed to be more dragons than ever. it was not very easy to know what would poison a dragon because you see they ate such different things. the largest kind ate elephants as long as there were any and then went on with horses and cows. but the size effie was most afraid of was about as big as your dining room and that size ate little girls and boys. at first effie and her brother were quite pleased with the change in their lives. you must not get up before its quite dark. and they wanted so much to get out just for once in the beautiful bright dangerous daylight that they began to try and think of some reason why they ought to go out. said effie. effie said no but where could they find st. george i know where we can find st. george then they joined hands and set out to walk to st. georges church. fortunately none of the dragons were just the right size for eating little boys and girls or perhaps this story might have had to end here. the town was quite green with them. the children could hear the rattle of their wings as they flew. they said. but st. george took no notice. so the children told him all about it he turned over in his marble and leaned on one elbow to listen. but when he heard that there were so many dragons he shook his head. just then a flight of dragons passed overhead and st. george half drew his sword. but he shook his head again and pushed the sword back as the flight of dragons grew small in the distance. and he fell back into his marble and was fast asleep again in a moment. so she covered st. george with the veil and harry rubbed off as much as he could of the dragon poison onto st. georges armor so as to make everything quite safe for him. so then they knew that all was lost. and still the dragon flew on. the children saw other dragons in the air as they went but the dragon who was as big as the dining room never stopped to speak to any of them but just flew on quite steadily. then effie took out the knife harry had given her on her birthday. it was much too narrow for the dragon to get in also so they stayed in there and waited to make faces at the dragon when he felt rested enough to sit up and begin to think about eating them. he was very angry indeed when they made faces at him and blew out fire and smoke at them but they ran farther into the cave so that he could not reach them and when he was tired of blowing he went away. private. no one allowed inside. so they opened the door at once just to peep in and then they remembered what st. george had said. then they saw that one side of the room was just a big looking glass and when you looked in it you could see everything that was going on in the world and all at once too which is not like most looking glasses. and they saw their mother at home crying because her children had gone out in the dreadful dangerous daylight and she was afraid a dragon had eaten them. and they could see that it was still broad daylight and no dragons had gone to bed yet. so they left the sunshine tap alone and they turned on the snow and left the tap full on while they went to look in the glass. and the snow fell more and more. so then they turned on the hail only half on for fear of breaking peoples windows and after a while there were no more dragons to be seen moving. said effie. what can they do with such a lot of dead dragons he had found a rusty old tap which seemed as though it had not been used for ages. the tap was very stiff from not having been used for such a long time but together they managed to turn it on and then ran to the mirror to see what happened. presently there was not a dragon left. how did they get home again and was the nation grateful well the nation was very wet. dragons do not seem so important when they are dead and gone and you know there never was a reward offered. and what did father and mother say when effie and harry got home my dear that is the sort of silly question you children always will ask. however just for this once i dont mind telling you. i threw away the one i got out of effies eye. the professor said nothing but he rubbed his hands. you must get him to show it to you iv. their names were george and jane. he was cutting his first tooth and that is a very anxious time for any person even for a royal one. said george. and he said so. asked jane. george had to own that he had not learned that. asked jane. im not so stupid as you think george. jane got off the fence. oh george do do lets. so off they went. and the northern lights still seemed some way off. and then they stood still and held their breath with wonder. the childrens feet made no noise on the ice and they went on and on in a beautiful white silence. you there cried george and he fell down at once because it is the only way to stop. said he. the reason for shooting him stopped yesterday i heard father say so so it wouldnt be fair anyhow. so they left him trying and went on. you there cried jane. and it did. i shall have to go home and fit out another. and that means a lot of writing to the papers and things. it was made entirely of ice. and though he was very terrible he was very beautiful too. they joined hands as they came near the fires and danced around in a ring. this sounded so dreadful that jane began to cry. directly jane began to cry all the brown people started back. so that these people had never seen anyone cry before. so jane went on pretending to howl and the real crying stopped it always does when you begin to pretend. you try it. yelled george. they were very fat and round. but the dwarfs came a step nearer muttering and whispering. then the muttering stopped and there was a silence so deep that jane was afraid to howl in it. but it was a brown silence and she had liked the white silence better. the dwarf did not wait for an answer. now by this time the children were so cold so cold so very very cold that they had forgotten everything but that and they could say nothing else. the white grouse laughed and his laugh was echoed by thousands of kind soft bird voices. thus spoke the grouse who certainly had very pretty manners. the dragon had not moved yet but then he might at any moment get warm enough to move and though george and jane were now warm they were not comfortable nor easy in their minds. so they told him. the dwarfs did not see their danger till it was too late. he never thought that the dragon himself might help them but then that was an idea that would never have occurred to any boy. but when the fires were out he felt quite well and very hungry. he looked around for something to eat. but he never noticed george and jane because they were frozen to his back. of course the dragon had to go south if he went anywhere because when you get to the north pole there is no other way to go. george was rather glad too though neither of the children felt at all sure of their welcome especially as their feet were wet and they were bringing a strange dragon home with them. it was long past their time anyhow. my dear i do not know i am not too proud to own that there are some things i know nothing about and this is one of them. and the snakes had been so badly brought up that they even put their tongues out at the poor lady. nasty thin sharp tongues they were too. now the queens husband was of course the king. so he gave the queen the witchs address and the queen called on her though she was very frightened and did not like it at all. she said to the queen. we dont want any expense spared. and so you want a child the queen took it off quickly. the queen gathered together the lilies. the queen pulled off her shoes. asked the queen. then the queen threw her arms around the witchs neck and kissed her half a hundred times. each of your fifty kisses will be a spell to bring me to you. but the snakes knew the queen was friends with their mistress so of course they had to do their best to be civil. it had pink ribbons to tie up its sleeves so the queen saw at once it was a girl. when the king knew this he tore his black hair with fury. he said. did you think i went to all the trouble and expense of sending you to a witch to get a girl and the queen hung her head and had to confess that she had only asked for a child. the queen did. all the years of her life had never held half so much happiness as now lived in each of the moments when she held her little baby in her arms. and the years went on and the king grew more and more clever at magic and more and more disagreeable at home and the princess grew more beautiful and more dear every day she lived. he shook his fist at his family as indeed he generally did whenever he met them for he was not a king with pretty home manners. it was all he could do to show that he was in the same temper as his master. said the king angrily. the king could not utter a word for several minutes. he was too angry. then the king found his tongue. the queen knew at once by the kings tone that he was going to be disagreeable. the next day his plan was all arranged. he took the poor princess to the lone tower which stands on an island in the sea a thousand miles from everywhere. till he comes youll never get any older or any wiser. no doubt he will soon come. the queen left at home cried for a day and a night and then she remembered the witch and called to her. and the witch came and the queen told her all. but it is the last thing i can do and it is not much. your daughter is under a spell and i can take you to her. time shall not make the princess sad. and you and i dear queen will sit in stone at the gate of the tower. then the three kissed one another again and again and the witch said the spell and on each side of the door there was now a stone lady. and now all days seemed like one day to the princess and the next day always seemed the day when her mother would come out of the stone and kiss her again. and the years went slowly by. and all the time from the very first the day of the princesss deliverance was coming creeping nearer and nearer and nearer. but no one saw it coming except the princess and she only in dreams. and the years went by. now there is something which is wiser than all the world and it knows when people are worthy to be princes. and this something came from the farther side of the seventh world and whispered in the boys ear. so he hung off and on all that day and for six days besides. and when he had watched seven days he knew something. and every day this happened but every day it was five minutes earlier than it had been the day before. then he dragged it into a cave and sat down to wait. he shut a little kiss in each hand before he let them go. asked the princess. but the griffin has dreams. so he did. and then she told him all about herself. and i am very busy sewing silk flowers on a golden gown for my wedding day. but it was all of no use. but it would not do. he got an answer every time it is true but it was always a different one and he could not feel sure which answer was right. and now it was getting dark. it has figures in it. and it came right every time. and they waited. then at last came the day. and the two lovers stood looking up at the dragon. he was dreadful to look at. his head was white with age and his beard had grown so long that he caught his claws in it as he walked. his wings were white with the salt that had settled on them from the spray of the sea. he had one end of a cord tied to his arm. but before it reached the shore sleep caught it and turned it to stone. but ive never seen him. so they talked it over and arranged everything. she was a little stiff from standing still so long. im only a happy old woman but i know some things still. that was the first drop of the wicked kings blood. so the wicked king did some good after all. when the sea was smooth ships came from far and wide bringing people to hear the wonderful story. the dragon still lies a stone dragon on the sand and at low tide the little children play around him and over him. i have no doubt that you will wish to know what the princess lived on during the long years when the dragon did the cooking. my dear she lived on her income and that is a thing that a great many people would like to be able to do. the blacksmith had never dared to go beyond the seventh step and no more have i so i know no more than he did what was at the bottom of those stairs. john the blacksmith had a wife and a little baby. and now johns hair was getting gray and there was hardly ever enough to eat. as for the baby it cried a good deal at odd times but at night when its mother had settled down to sleep it would always begin to cry quite as a matter of course so that she hardly got any rest at all. this made her very tired. the baby could make up for its bad nights during the day if it liked but the poor mother couldnt. so whenever she had nothing to do she used to sit and cry because she was tired out with work and worry. one evening the blacksmith was busy with his forge. this was the only order john had had that week. the blacksmith and his wife looked at each other. said his wife. and they tried so hard to believe that there could be nothing there that presently they very nearly did believe it. but the other side was not empty. it was quite full and what it was full of was dragon. the dragon seemed very much struck by this remark. said he quite politely. at this moment the baby in the room above began to scream. its mother had been so quiet that it thought she had settled down for the night and that it was time to begin. said the dragon starting so that every plate on his body rattled. asked the dragon. babies are poison to dragons so i dont deceive you. its all right to touch but dont you go putting it into your mouth. his wife was asleep in spite of the babys cries and john picked up the baby and took it down and put it between the dragons front paws. if youll excuse me sir ill step around to another forge and get a few dozen. and he told them all about it. said john. so john went home again and told his wife some of the tale. she cried. he said. the job must wait till the morning. and dont forget youve promised to take care of that baby. youll find it a little wearing im afraid. so it began. the baby went on screaming. and he tried to quiet the baby as if it had been a young dragon. so the mother picked up the baby and took it upstairs and told her husband and they went to bed happy for they had caught the dragon and saved the baby. but after this things went a little better with the blacksmith. to begin with the baby did not cry so much as it had before. and they grew older and wiser. no one seemed to know what to do. said the dragon. said the dragon showing his teeth. it is not you who have settled the giant it is the dragon. asked the dragon. so they went in and with the help of nine other children they lifted the washing tub in and set it down by the dragon. asked the dragon. the mayor told him you were a wild dragon but he didnt mind. the children said it was. and they began to cry again. and presently he began to feel faint as people sometimes do when they have been crying especially if they have not had anything to eat for ten years or so. and then the poor creature dried his eyes and looked about him and there he saw the tub of bread and milk. and as he moved more and more of his rusty plates fell off. he brought something in his mouth it was a bag of gold. so they thanked him very kindly. indeed everyone was rich and there were no more poor people in the town. and they all got rich without working which is very wrong but the dragon had never been to school as you have so he knew no better. and i hope you see now how important it is to feed your cat with bread and milk. and then there would be all the bother over again. for of all who should have served her only one remained faithful her old nurse who had lived with her in the tower all the princesss life. across the fields troops of children were going out to gather the may and the sound of their laughter and singing came up to the top of the tower. the sun shone and the sky was blue and the fields were quite green and all the flowers were very bright indeed because it was may day. open the gates the dragon is coming the princess went down and told her nurse and the nurse at once locked the great door of the tower and put the key in her pocket. the pack squeezed through the town gates and off across country to hunt the dragon. the dragon was shy and would not show himself. hark forward cried the prince. and indeed it was. he hoped the dragon could not break through the bushes there since they were very strong and close. he never shed a tear but he just went to sleep. when he awoke it was dark. he crept out of the tree and rubbed his eyes. it was a fire of sticks and beside it sat a ragged youth with long yellow hair all around lay sleeping forms which breathed heavily. said the prince. a good hunt wasnt it the dragon grows small at night asked the prince. but when the wicked prince made promises he did not make them to keep. he said. and he drew his sword. for they knew what happened to people with whom the prince was not pleased. the nurse was asleep so there was no one to tell the princess not to and she did. and so it did. and the moment it opened the prince pushed the white princess out of her tower just as he had pushed her out of her kingdom and shut the door. for he wanted to have the tower all for himself. she had never been out of her tower before and the soft grass under her feet felt like grass of paradise. he told her of the mean trick that the prince had played on him. asked the princess. he asked. said the princess. she found the door of her tower open. then the dragon went back to the wood because it was getting near his time to grow small for the night. and the pigs sat outside and waited. asked the princess. said the nurse. come along nurse dont wait to put on your bonnet. next morning the prince and princess went out to see if the dragon had been washed ashore. the nurse lives with them and does nothing but fine sewing and only that when she wants to very much. but she was very kind and very old. edmund loved to find out about things. but edmund did not want to learn things he wanted to find things out which is quite different. edmund lived with his grandmother. edmund went to school of course now and then and sometimes he could not prevent himself from learning something but he never did it on purpose. but edmund did not agree with her. edmund was not afraid of these noises though they were very strange and terrible. he wanted to find out what made them. one day he did. but edmund did not care for any of these things just then. presently he sat down in the biggest cave and listened very carefully and it seemed to him that he could distinguish three different sorts of noises. and being a boy he climbed up to it and crept in and it was the entrance to a rocky passage. the passage wound and twisted and twisted and turned and turned and wound but edmund kept on. the next moment edmund turned a corner and found himself in front of a rocky door. said edmund. my fires gone out i cant think how it happened i must have been asleep. very loudly and clearly. said the creature. and when he got hungry again he said goodbye and went home. but he came again the next day for more stories and the next day and the next for a long time. edmund had a watch it had been given to him on his birthday two days before and he had not yet had time to take it to pieces and see what made it go so it was still going. he looked at it now. it said a quarter to three. he pointed out of the window and everyone could see a vast yellow cloud rising up into the air above the mountain. you see he had heard so many wonderful tales from him and had believed them all and when you believe all a persons stories they ought to believe yours. this is only fair. as he ran he had felt his little legs tremble and shake while the shadows of the great yellow cloud fell upon him. said edmund. now this was exactly the right way to manage edmund only no one had ever thought of trying to do it before. the next moment it began to come out of its room and to put on its shoes. when edmund came to the proper place he stopped. there was a round iron thing in the floor like the ones the men shoot the coals down into your cellar only much larger. theres plenty of it all done to a turn. in a voice that made edmund feel as if he should never laugh again. he he he her tail was a mile or two off outside the mountain. whatever may have been the poor dragons other faults she was an excellent mother. edmund watched her head go and then the rest of her. she was so long now she had stretched herself thin that it took all night. of course he could not have done this if the town had been in its old place by the river in the middle of the plain but it had taken root on the hillside just where the dragon left it. the master pointed to the map on the wall. there was the town on the hillside and poor edmund could not say a word though he knew how wrong they were. but then she was very old and very kind and had always said he was the best of boys. only one good thing came of all this long story. edmund has never been quite the same boy since. the elder child was a little girl whom because she was of a tender and modest disposition and was thought to be very beautiful her parents and other people who were familiar with her used to call violet. then what a merry time had they and that puts me in mind let us make an image out of snow an image of a little girl and it shall be our sister and shall run about and play with us all winter long. cried peony as plainly as he could speak for he was but a little boy. so thought the mother and thought likewise that the new snow just fallen from heaven would be excellent material to make new beings of if it were not so very cold. then the mother resumed her work. indeed it was an exceedingly pleasant sight those bright little souls at their task their mother was quite surprised at this and the longer she looked the more and more surprised she grew. thought she smiling with a mothers pride and smiling at herself too for being so proud of them. they kept talking to one another all the time their tongues being quite as active as their feet and hands. cried violet for her brother was again at the other side of the garden. answered the little boy. well done well done she is not finished yet. nonsense mamma mamma the mother put down her work for an instant and looked out of the window. faster and faster therefore went her flying fingers. the children likewise kept busily at work in the garden and still the mother listened whenever she could catch a word. said violet. cried peony. answered violet with grave wisdom. come quickly and the color does not go away she is almost finished now. cried peony. cried peony. mamma the mother being thus entreated could no longer delay to look forth from the window. and what do you think she saw there violet and peony of course her own two darling children. ah but whom or what did she see besides the mother thought to herself that it must certainly be the daughter of one of the neighbors and that seeing violet and peony in the garden the child had run across the street to play with them. there was certainly something very singular in the aspect of the little stranger. it made this kind and careful mother shiver only to look at those small feet with nothing in the world on them except a very thin pair of white slippers. she called violet and whispered to her. asked she. is not she a nice one inquired this very sensible man. some neighbors child i suppose. no image at all no piled up heap of snow said she. asked violet. come wife this little stranger must not stay out in the bleak air a moment longer. we will bring her into the parlor and you shall give her a supper of warm bread and milk and make her as comfortable as you can. it is too late to play any longer now. no no at length after a vast deal of trouble he chased the little stranger into a corner where she could not possibly escape him. but we will make it all right. quite crazy my small peony she is so cold already that her hand has almost frozen mine in spite of my thick gloves. she is half frozen poor little thing the parlor was hung with red curtains and covered with a red carpet and looked just as warm as it felt. oh this was a fine place for the little white stranger you violet and peony amuse your little friend. she is out of spirits you see at finding herself in a strange place. in the utmost perplexity he demanded an explanation of his wife. added she pointing to a pool of water in front of the stove. they know everything oh to be sure everything that has been and everything that is and everything that by any future possibility can be. the great stone face 
one afternoon when the sun was going down a mother and her little boy sat at the door of their cottage talking about the great stone face. and what was the great stone face it was an education only to look at it. the childs name was ernest. eagerly inquired ernest. and ernest never forgot the story that his mother told him. it was always in his mind whenever he looked upon the great stone face. yet ernest had had no teacher save only that the great stone face became one to him. cried a group of people who were assembled to witness the arrival. a carriage drawn by four horses dashed round the turn of the road. shouted the people. and what greatly perplexed ernest they seemed actually to believe that here was the likeness which they spoke of. their aspect cheered him. the years went on and ernest ceased to be a boy. he had grown to be a young man now. cried a third. was now the cry. silence ernest saw him. alas ernest could not recognize it ernest still dwelt in his native valley and was now a man of middle age. not a day passed by that the world was not the better because this man humble as he was had lived. he never stepped aside from his own path yet would always reach a blessing to his neighbor. it was the blast of war the song of peace and it seemed to have a heart in it when there was no such matter. among these was ernest. he kept his heart continually open and thus was sure to catch the blessing from on high when it should come. if the pictures were to be trusted the mutual resemblance it must be confessed was marvellous. but as yet he had not seen him. cried those who stood near ernest. there confess he was an aged man. thus the world assumed another and a better aspect from the hour that the poet blessed it with his happy eyes. the songs of this poet found their way to ernest. the face seemed to smile but answered not a word. the poet sat down on the bench beside him and he and ernest talked together. so thought the poet. as ernest listened to the poet he imagined that the great stone face was bending forward to listen too. he gazed earnestly into the poets glowing eyes. he said. the poet laid his finger on the volume that ernest had been reading. again and still more earnestly than before ernest examined the poets features then turned towards the great stone face then back with an uncertain aspect to his guest. but his countenance fell he shook his head and sighed. inquired the poet. yes ernest it is my doom. asked ernest. he pointed to the volume. sometimes even shall i dare to say it the poet spoke sadly and his eyes were dim with tears. so likewise were those of ernest. he and the poet arm in arm still talking together as they went along proceeded to the spot. ernest began to speak giving to the people of what was in his heart and mind. behold hark here comes the merry fellow now. said the stranger calmly. replied he. i have left him behind me on my track. fear not because i open the door. but i found not there what i sought. i have done with you. then let me tell you the truth. for some years past this aged person had been wandering about among the hills inquiring of all travellers whom he met for his daughter. as it happened there was other amusement at hand. what had he seen but where was the heart o stars of heaven that shone on me of old as if to light me onward and upward farewell all and forever. he issued from the hut followed by little joe who kept fast hold of his fathers hand. after a moments pause he called to his son. said he. there were three men a woman and a little girl and boy. asked one of the strangers. but sit you here awhile and when you have heard what we shall tell you of the world which we have left and into which you are going perhaps you will turn back with us of your own accord. added he turning to his companions. however he had an intelligent eye and on the whole a marked countenance. alas o fate how can i rejoice in my strength and delicacy of feeling when they have but made great sorrows out of little ones but i have my revenge you stare. exclaimed the younger man. though my husband told you some of our troubles he didnt mention the greatest and that which makes all the rest so hard to bear. cried they. they had but stepped across the threshold of their homes when lo you are gone you cannot even pray for deliverance the tales have done all this. when they are ashes perhaps i shall be as i was before they had existence. it would make you stare to read their answers and read them you should only that i burnt them as fast as they arrived. cried i. said my friend. exclaimed i. cried i. i tell you there is a demon in them he laid violent hands on the tales. i caught his arm. i exclaimed. no there go the tales the deed was done. there i see my lovers clasped in each others arms. ring out the bells a city is on fire. see ha well the deed has been my fate. and what remains just as they disappeared there was a loud and solitary cry in the street below us. fire other voices caught up that terrible word and it speedily became the shout of a multitude. cried he. the street was now all alive with footsteps and the air full of voices. fire come we are losing time. at once the truth flashed upon my friend. the roof my brain has set the town on fire i tell you i know not the man you speak of. what ah robin robin at length on the corner of a narrow lane through which he was passing he beheld the broad countenance of a british hero swinging before the door of an inn whence proceeded the voices of many guests. said robin with a sigh. said he with a profound bow. in his progress robin encountered many gay and gallant figures. and first he threw his eyes along the street. said robin. inquired he. but would you believe it sir inquired the gentleman. i believe you may trust his word and that the major will very shortly pass through this street. asked he. said his friend. the sounds of a trumpet in some neighboring street now became so evident and continual that robins curiosity was strongly excited. inquired the gentleman. the leader turned himself in the saddle and fixed his glance full upon the country youth as the steed went slowly by. inquired the gentleman laying his hand on the youths shoulder. his cheek was somewhat pale and his eye not quite as lively as in the earlier part of the evening. said he after a moments pause. observed his companion with a smile. i begin to grow weary of a town life sir. ozma smiled. the truth was that ozma was thinking of events that had happened many years before in the history of the land of oz. not always had oz been a fairy realm. indeed oz had not been so much different from our own united states except that it was surrounded on all sides by a deadly desert. it was this desert which prevented curious men from the great outside world from finding their way to oz. one fine day queen lurline ruler of all the fairies in the world chanced to be flying over the land of oz with her fairy band. she was greatly impressed with the beauty of the hidden country. the fairy queen paused flying in wide circles over the peaceful land. here was a country so entirely beautiful and charming that it deserved to be a fairy realm. with great joy the old king accepted the tiny baby fairy whom queen lurline placed in his care. looking up she saw dorothy standing in the doorway. dorothy asked as she sat down beside her friend. asked dorothy eagerly. dorothy asked softly. asked dorothy. ozmas voice was grave as she answered. asked dorothy. asked dorothy. cried dorothy. dorothy was silent considering. ozma kissed dorothy on the cheek and the two girls left the room arm in arm parting a few minutes later as ozma went about making preparations for her journey. dorothy joined toto who was waiting patiently for her in the lovely gardens of the royal palace. dorothy had a long talk with the wizard later in the day. ozma stood before her throne and raised her hand. we shall be gone from oz for a period of three days. mount illuso 
on that far away day those many years ago when queen lurline had left the baby ozma to become the ruler of oz queen lurline did not pause for she knew the most important part of her work was still to be done. the most unusual thing about the creatures was their strange habit of constantly changing their shapes. the good queen shuddered in spite of herself. in a few minutes the enchantment was completed. as for the unfortunate victim he fell into a spell of enchantment unable to move or speak but conscious of all that was taking place about him. no wonder queen lurline sighed with relief when she thought that her powerful magic had made the oz people secure against the dread evil of the mimics she still had other important work to do here. when she returned to her fairy companion queen lurline gave her brief instructions concerning the important part she was to play at mount illuso in the coming years. then they both spread their fairy wings and flew straight to the very summit of the hollow mount. it is a question which was the more wicked and dangerous of this pair. first she had discovered that ozma and glinda were about to depart on a journey that would take them away from the land of oz. king umb wore the form of a black bear with an owl head. princess ozma stood by her throne with glinda the good at her side. ozma was addressing her subjects. then the girl ruler smiled and raised her wand. in an instant both ozma and glinda had vanished. the ball of glowing mist disappeared. she cried. asked king umb. we will go directly to the emerald city. there we will seek out the two mortals from the great outside world whose shapes will admit us to every part of the royal palace. then we will be free to search through ozmas magic record books. the owl eyes of king umb had been regarding queen ra intently as she revealed her plan. during the creatures long flight over the deadly desert to oz they changed shapes a number of times but always to another form of powerful bird. since all birds and animals in the land of oz possess the power of human speech the wizard naturally addressed the birds as he would have spoken to human beings. but the birds made no reply. instead two of them stepped swiftly toward dorothy and the wizard who had risen in surprise and were standing beside their chairs. the two birds flung themselves on the shadows cast by the girl and the man. all this had happened in much less time than i have taken to tell it and it was so sudden and unexpected that our friends had not even had time to cry out. one black bird grasped the form of the helpless wizard the other that of dorothy. swiftly they left the emerald city. the fact that they had left the land of oz behind them disturbed dorothy greatly. yet the little girl did not give way to fright. where were these great birds taking them and why straight for the mountain flew the birds. when this happened she always lay down and rolled about until she had resumed her original plump shape. her fingers carefully formed and fitted with gold plates for finger nails dug into the path on which she sat. now she was too surprised to speak. asked scraps. dorothy wanted me to think up some ideas for the entertainment to accompany the dinner. i agreed to set my famous brains to work on the problem and spent all last night in deep thought. this morning bright and early i rushed to dorothy and started to tell her the ideas i had. the scarecrow paused his brow wrinkled with perplexity. dorothy always visits her aunt em and uncle henry at least once a day. this explanation failed to satisfy the scarecrow. he was gazing in the distance down the garden path. the scarecrow followed and he and scraps were warmly greeted by little trot and old capn bill. the scarecrow repeated his story of the strange manner in which dorothy had been acting but neither trot nor capn bill had seen dorothy that day. the old sailor was silent for a moment considering. asked the scarecrow. the boats nearly finished a handsome craft if i do say so myself. the four old friends were silent each turning over the problem in his own mind. the bench on which trot and capn bill were sitting was in front of a high hedge so high that none of them could see over it. on the other side of the thick hedge ran another garden path. suddenly they heard footsteps as if several people were hurrying down the garden path which was hidden from their view. theres no one about. asked the wizards voice. give me time its there. replied the wizards voice raised in excitement. what could this mean in the cavern of the doomed 
neither dorothy nor the wizard could tell how long they lay in their cavern prison deep in hollow mount illuso but it is certain that minutes seemed like hours to them. but what if ozma and glinda were deceived how long would she and the wizard be kept in the cave what wicked plot was behind all this and just how powerful and clever were the creatures who had captured her and the wizard there was a light in the cavern the two prisoners could see each other as the light grew more brilliant dorothy felt pleasantly warm and glowing as though she were lying in the bright sunlight. and then to her intense joy the little girl realized that the spell cast on her was broken. the light had released her. she was free to move about as she pleased. dorothy jumped happily to her feet. asked dorothy eagerly. said dorothy. she asked after a moments hesitation. dorothy looked about her. as dorothy and the wizard listened the sound grew louder. whispered dorothy. it stopped completely and there was silence. this did not strike the little dog as strange. he knew ozma might have left instructions for dorothy and the wizard to carry out in the chamber of magic. promptly at seven oclock the inhabitants of the royal palace began to gather in the grand dining room. at the far end of the room was a separate table shared by the animal companions of the oz people. dorothys place was at ozmas right while the wizard sat at her left. now only toto remained absent. as toto trotted into the dining room his bright little eyes immediately sought out his mistress. in the silence that fell over the dining room at the dogs unusual actions toto repeated his question. he demanded. the scarecrow was staring earnestly at toto. shes not dorothy at all. watch your step miss. were on our way up next stop the top asked dorothy drawing a deep breath. dorothy did as the wizard suggested and found the ringing sensation disappeared. asked the wizard gazing curiously at the little man. exclaimed the little man with surprise. allow me to introduce myself. while he spoke dorothy had been regarding the little man who called himself hilo. he was very short his head coming only to dorothys waist. his face was round and his cheeks as rosy as two apples. his blue eyes were very bright and friendly. and dorothy concluded he was most certainly made of some substance other than flesh and blood. he pressed another button. all out yes this was certainly the top of mount illuso. as they approached the tiny cottage the front door swung open and a little woman stood in the doorway. the wizard found it necessary to bend over to get in the doorway so small was the cottage. once inside his head nearly touched the ceiling. exclaimed mrs. hilo. ill get you something to eat in no time at all. cried mrs. hilo. he repeated as if he couldnt believe his own ears. asked hilo. asked the wizard quietly. the food was delicious and as dorothy and the wizard had not eaten since breakfast and it was now nearly evening they did full justice to the meal. when they had finished the wizard sighed with satisfaction and sat back in his chair. he asked. inquired dorothy. exclaimed dorothy. he asked hilo. dorothy and the wizard could offer no objection to this sensible and kindly offer of hospitality. after several more questions about the ruler who called herself ozana dorothy and the wizard decided that hilo and his wife knew nothing more beyond the facts that princess ozana had created the pine folks and built the village for them to live in. dorothy asked mrs. hilo. once we had a son. he was not a very good boy and was continually getting into mischief. he wanted to travel and see the world. from that time on we have never heard anything more of him. asked the wizard. inquired the wizard thoughtfully. yes it was exclaimed mrs. hilo. step lively please. called mrs. hilo from the door of the cottage. called mr. hilo. in a short time the cottage was lost to their view and the two travelers were deep in the cool shade of the pine forest. asked dorothy. exclaimed the red squirrel. asked the wizard smiling with amusement. snapped the little red squirrel. and with that the wise little creature gave a leap and a bound and darted up the trunk of the one and only nut tree in all the pine forest. the sun was almost directly overhead by this time. a wooden woman was washing the windows of her cottage. but none of them seemed to fear the meat people. a wooden lady approached them walking down the street with quick lively steps. pausing the wizard removed his hat and in his most polite manner addressed her. asked the woman with a puzzled expression on her face. princess ozana 
dorothy exclaimed with delight as they stepped through the garden gate. she had no idea any garden could be so beautiful. here and there throughout the garden a score or more of little wooden men were busily at work. none of them took the slightest notice of dorothy and the wizard so absorbed were they in their work. the little maid looked up regarding the strangers with friendly curiosity. dorothy saw that she was very lovely. wait for me dont leave me here she cried. asked dorothy eagerly. asked the wizard. dorothy nodded. while they enjoyed their food ozana and her guests exchanged stories. first dorothy and the wizard related their adventures. exclaimed dorothy. the wizard who knew nothing of the mimics listened with interest as ozana described the creatures. i enchanted the light so that it would appear soon after prisoners were placed in the cave. i did all this by my fairy arts. i knew the escaped prisoners would find their way to me and i could aid them if i judged them worthy. but it was too much like playing with dolls and i soon tired. this occupied me for many long years. and then my fairy light served me well. the wizard had been very thoughtful while ozana was speaking. ozana was grave at this question. we have nothing to fear now. however i will spend the entire afternoon and evening in study and by use of my fairy arts i will be able to discover just what king umb and queen ras plot is. asked the wizard. remember they are powerful enemies. do not worry my friends. i am sure you will find it so interesting that you will regret you have only one short afternoon to spend in it. dorothy asked. they are fairy flowers that i created with my fairy arts. and the soil in which they grow is magic soil. dorothy exclaimed in delight. she asked ozana. pick a blossom and hold it to your ear and it will tell you its story. the flowers are all eager to be picked so that they may tell their stories. asked dorothy. dorothy asked. i must ask you to excuse me from the evening meal. pick me pick me immediately ill tell you a story that will burn your ears off dorothy was sure the shy little violet hadnt uttered these words. theyre always loud and noisy and while we dont care much for their stories we feel they have as much right to grow as any other plants. she decided the blossom was a trifle green. the man was already awake and in excellent spirits as he greeted dorothy. dorothy thought this an excellent crown for the princess of story blossom garden. however queen ra has succeeded in doing something that has surprised me. asked the wizard. for this reason i think it would be wise for us to go as quickly as possible to the emerald city. the little mans expression was grave as he answered. asked dorothy. ozana smiled. dorothy and the wizard followed ozana to the cottage door and down the path that led to the edge of the pond. the garden was fresh and lovely in the early morning. dorothy regretted that there was no time for her to pick one of the delicate blossoms and listen to its story. standing at the edge of the pond ozana uttered a soft musical whistle. ozana laughed. the three swans were now at the ponds edge just at ozanas feet. while dorothy and the wizard watched the birds grew steadily before their wondering eyes. in a few seconds they were nearly five times the size of ordinary swans. she found the great bird supported her easily. the wizard had already mounted the third swan. dorothy looked behind her and saw ozanas cottage growing smaller as the birds climbed higher and higher into the heavens. in a short time they had left mount illuso so far in the distance that it was no longer visible. dorothy called. ozanas bird flew in advance with the swans bearing dorothy and the wizard slightly to her rear on either side of her. the swans flew even higher over the desert than had the mimic birds. it seemed to the little girl that the fairy princess was disturbed and anxious. called dorothy. i can feel the change now that we are actually over the land of oz. i am trying to discover what has happened by means of my fairy powers. suddenly the fairy princesss expression changed. i now understand all that has happened. you see in some ways animals are wiser than human beings. king umb and queen ra were able to fool the oz people just by looking like dorothy and the wizard but they couldnt deceive the keen senses of the little dog so easily. suddenly queen ra leaped to her feet. she pulled the mimic king after her and the two dashed from the dining room. for a moment everyone was too startled to move except toto. by the time the scarecrow had reached the corridor king umb queen ra and toto were nowhere in sight. but the straw man could hear totos excited barking. following in the direction of the sound down one corridor and up another the scarecrow arrived in the wing of the palace usually occupied by ozma and found toto barking before a closed door. the little dogs eyes flashed angrily. toto asked. why i want to know the straw man was thoughtful. something is happening that we dont understand. we must find out what it is. i believe the wisest thing we can do is to return to the dining room and hold a council to talk this thing over. asked tiny trot. now capn bill spoke up. but no one paid any attention to the boy. asked the scarecrow. magic they were talking about a magic spell which they hoped to find before ozma and glinda returned. all right. now where did dorothy and the wizard spend most of the day and where have they fled just now to lock themselves in with his chin in his hand the scarecrow was regarding scraps in silent admiration. we must go to ozmas chamber of magic and try to persuade this strange dorothy and the wizard to admit us. exclaimed toto. the door was still locked. then capn bill stepped forward. he knew what was expected of him as the biggest and strongest of the group. he placed a shoulder against the door and pushed. again capn bill pushed. in the chamber of magic 
when queen ra seized king umb by the arm and fled with him from the dining room the mimic queen was alarmed. commanded queen ra angrily. we still have time to find the magic spell. and we will only four books remained to be searched through. now only two books remained. suddenly queen ra leaped to her feet with a cry of triumph. she tore a page from the book and cast the volume to the floor. soon we will come again to oz. both ra and umb laughed with wicked satisfaction. just then the scarecrow called to dorothy and the wizard to open the door and admit them. muttered queen ra. instantly the figures of dorothy and the wizard vanished and in their places appeared two great black birds with huge powerful wings. just as capn bill burst open the door and the scarecrow and the rest crowded into the room the birds flew from the window. the little group hurried to the window and looked out. the night was too dark and the birds too far away for any of the oz people to see that one of the creatures clutched dorothys magic belt. more bewildered than ever the scarecrow and his companions turned from the window. it was true enough. there was no trace of dorothy or the wizard in the chamber of magic. and why did they want us to believe they were dorothy and the wizard exclaimed the scarecrow. dorothy and the wizard were just about to sit down to the food mrs. hilo had prepared for them. the scarecrow knew that when dorothy was not wearing her magic belt on a journey it was always kept in ozmas chamber of magic. so the straw man went there himself to get the belt. the magic belt is nowhere in the chamber of magic. either ozma took it with her or it has been stolen. disappointment was reflected on everyones face and for a moment no one spoke. asked capn bill. exclaimed the scarecrow. that is too bad. queen ra received the news with a scream of rage. blowing on her brass whistle she summoned two other mimics. king umb was uneasy. but we succeeded in stealing it. i tell you umb the famous land of oz is doomed. immediately there crawled from the box a scarlet spider as large as the queens hand. in a few seconds it had reached the top of the cavern. shouted queen ra. and what beautiful creatures those birds were commanded button bright who was nearly as excited as the stuffed girl. the boy called. the scheme worked even better than queen ra dared dream. outside the grounds of the royal palace much the same thing was happening throughout the emerald city. this was just what the mimics wanted. he could only stare with amazement at an exact double of himself wooden leg and all. at the same moment the bird vanished and the boys double appeared in its place. and so it went throughout the emerald city. but it was too late. however the mimics were able to steal the shapes only of human beings. these were king umb and queen ra. at this point the mimic king and queen cast off their bird forms. her hair was twisted on her head in a hard black knot on which was set a small golden crown. the scarecrow started with surprise when he saw that the strange woman was wearing dorothys magic belt. scraps was more of a problem. while our friends were being made prisoners king umb and queen ra hastened away to the throne room of the royal palace. there the prisoners of the mimics were carried into the presence of the mimic king and queen. that other was toto suddenly it occurred to the straw man that ozma and glinda were to return to the emerald city at ten oclock this morning. it was almost that time now. as for your princess dorothy and the man who calls himself a wizard you will never see them again. what had she to fear from two mere mortals what had she to fear from anyone now at these words queen ra turned angrily upon the scarecrow. she cried. her eyes flashing with rage queen ra leaped from the throne and moved toward the scarecrow. instantly dancing flames of fire leaped from the marble floor of the throne room making a circle around the scarecrow. with a smile of satisfaction queen ra resumed her place on ozmas throne to enjoy the spectacle in comfort. the friends of the scarecrow watched in horror. prisoners themselves there was nothing they could do to save their old comrade from this terrible fate. there was a sudden rush of air and in the center of the throne room stood princess ozma and glinda the good on the exact spot from which they had vanished three days before. a long sigh of relief went up from the scarecrows friends. ozma asked. the stately glinda spoke now her voice grave and thoughtful. you have not a friend in the emerald city to aid you. everyone of your subjects in the city is a victim of the mimic magic. soon this will be true of all the land of oz. the little ruler and glinda the good were silent. both realized that queen ra had spoken the truth when she had declared their powers to be useless against the mimics. it was toto the sudden appearance of the little dog and his desperate attack took ra and umb completely by surprise. a few seconds after totos attack there suddenly appeared in the entrance of the throne room three figures two of whom the scarecrow joyfully recognized as dorothy and the little wizard. they were accompanied by a maiden who was unknown to the scarecrow but whose beauty was quite evident. ozanas fairy arts 
swiftly princess ozana for the maiden was she advanced to the center of the throne room. ra had determined not to give up her triumph without a struggle. but nothing happened. in a rage queen ra tore the useless belt from her waist and flung it to the throne room floor. the unhappy queen said not a word. ozana was speaking with an air of calm justice. you thought you could attack oz without my knowing it. but you were wrong. i shall use those powers as queen lurline would wish me to. as ozana completed this speech she described a large circle in the air before her with her fairy wand. then while ozma and the rest watched a scene appeared in the cloud of silver mist. with the tip of her wand ozana touched the head of the image of the spider. the sound of these happy voices told princess ozma that her beloved subjects were no longer under the spell of the mimics. but for the moment the mimics were forgotten as all eyes were fastened with admiration and gratitude on princess ozana. ozana smiled happily. with happy tears of gratitude sparkling in her eyes she grasped the hands of princess ozana. nothing glinda and i can say or do will properly reward you. exclaimed ozma gazing at the mimics in the throne room. dorothy and the wizard and toto followed. ozana paused before the great door which was flung wide open. then they passed into the room itself. now came a whole procession of the mimic creatures first from all over the royal palace and finally from every part of the emerald city. in a sense the lion was right. the dainty ruler lifted her wand and murmured a fairy charm. dorothy and the wizard related their adventures on mount illuso and then the scarecrow tried to make clear to ozma glinda and dorothy and the wizard everything that had happened in the emerald city during their absence. with glindas departure the rest of ozmas guests began to take their leave until finally the girl ruler was alone with only dorothy and ozana. ozma laughed softly. is there any real reason why you should return to mount illuso the mimics are harmless enough now. exclaimed ozana eagerly. exclaimed ozana. arm in arm dorothy and ozana made their way to dorothys rooms where they spent the next hour in conversation. dorothy was well pleased with the prospect of ozanas making her home in oz for she believed the princess would be a delightful companion. asked ozma. asked dorothy. she is my own pet. instantly the magic pictures familiar country scene faded. even the blue pond had disappeared. there was no sign of any living thing in the dreary desert scene. dorothy cried. asked ozana. that is why my magic picture showed only a desert waste when you asked to see the pine village and the story blossom garden on mount illuso. the magic picture couldnt show them to you on mount illuso for they are no longer there the image of the desert waste faded and in the frame of the magic picture appeared the beautiful fairy garden. the vision was so real that dorothy could almost hear the blossoms whispering among themselves. dorothy asked. and you ozana will be able to live in your pretty cottage and work in your wonderful garden without fear of ever becoming lonely. every day will bring you visitors from the emerald city and all parts of the land of oz who will be eager to see the pine folk and their village and to enjoy story blossom garden. in the front seat of the red wagon rode ozma ozana dorothy and trot. on the surface of the blue pond floated the three swans. the rest of the day was devoted to preparing for the grand banquet to be given in ozanas honor that evening in the grand dining room of the royal palace. all of ozmas old friends and companions were invited. the grand banquet proved to be one of the most brilliant and delightful occasions ever to be enjoyed in the emerald city and was long remembered by all who were present. just as the happy banquet was about to end toto who had been so absorbed in all the excitement and the wizards marvelous tricks that he had scarcely tasted his food turned to his bowl of milk. they had three sons all of them young and such brave fellows that no pen could describe them. complained the son. ivan returned home. gently asked the frog. go to bed go to sleep. once said quickly done. the tsar father was pleased thanked his son ivan and issued a new order. my father the tsar ordered all of us to present our wives to him. the two elder brothers arrived first with their wives beautiful bright and cheerful and dressed in rich garments. and they laughed and laughed. lo what a noise the palace trembled the guests were all frightened. he led her with him to the heavy oak tables which were covered with snowwhite linen and loaded with many wonderful dishes such as are known and eaten only in the land of fairies and never anywhere else. the wives of the two elder brothers watched her and did exactly the same. when the long hearty dinner was over the guests began dancing and singing. she waved her right sleeve and white swans swam on the water. they waved their right sleeves and instead of swans the bones flew in the face of the tsar father. the tsar grew very angry and bade them leave the palace. the moment was near when we could have been happy together forever. now i must bid thee goodby. no one knows how long his journey was but one day he met an old old man. it was wrong to do so. listen now to me. but i pity thee and want to help thee. here is a magic ball. long very long was his road. and ivan did not shoot the bear. above in the sunny air there flew a duck a lovely white duck. and this time he obeyed the command of the duck and passed by. he walked farther and farther after the rolling ball and came to the deep blue sea. on the sand there lay a fish. i do not remember the name of the fish but it was a big fish almost dying on the dry sand. the ball rolling all the time brought ivan to a hut a queer tiny hut standing on tiny hens feet. the tiny hut turned its front at once. shouted ivan with anger. he told how he had lost his dear wife and that his only desire was to find her. ivan hastily went to the place. lo and behold a hare jumped out of the trunk and began to run fast but another hare ivans friend came running after caught it and tore it to pieces. out of the hare there flew a duck a gray one which flew very high and was almost invisible but the beautiful white duck followed the bird and struck its gray enemy which lost an egg. that egg fell into the deep sea. ivan meanwhile was anxiously watching his faithful friends helping him. but when the egg disappeared in the blue waters he could not help weeping. all of a sudden a big fish came swimming up the same fish he had saved and brought the egg in his mouth. how happy ivan was when he took it he took her home and they were very happy ever after. a famous tsar he was and a clever one. how could such a tsar be anything but happy so it was with the tsar archidei he was rich and clever besides being a handsome fellow but he could not find a bride to his taste a bride with wit and beauty equal to his own. and this was the cause of the tsar archideis sorrow and distress. before them all walked an old merchant white was his beard and he had about him the air of a wise man. besides the way to it is not known to us. he would require ten long years to go there ten years equally long to come back and so his journey would require fully twenty years. the tsar archidei became thoughtful. the tsar archidei sat still wrapped in thought but he could find neither beginning nor end to the problem. the tsar archidei was on horseback for a long while and finally came to a green valley. the tsar stopped in admiration. exclaimed the tsar archidei. but if thou wilt order i will build them simply one two and the ship is ready. laughed the tsar. he asked. the fourth brother bowed. the tsar archidei evidently liked the trade of the sixth simeon very well also. now come to my capital for a trial people like you are welcome. here the tsar archidei looked at the youngest simeon and remembered that he had not asked him about his trade. my trade is to steal and to hide the trace of how and when. as soon as these bold words of the seventh simeon reached the tsars ears he became very angry. i will give orders for thy cruel death if my wish had been to steal i should have done it long ago. i know well enough how to steal but will not. if thy wish were to learn my trade how could i keep it from thee the tsar thought a moment. but from this very day this very hour thou never shalt see gods light nor the bright sunshine nor the silvery moon. you have my grace and reward. in a short time the white column was ready and lo how high it went the second simeon climbed the column looked around listened to all sounds and came down. the tsar archidei anxious to know about everything under the sun ordered him to report and simeon did so. what a curious vessel it was while the tsar archidei enjoyed himself with looking at the marvelous vessel the fifth simeon built a blacksmith shop in the court back of the palace. the sixth simeon did not even allow the eagle to fall to the ground but quick as a flash he ran under it with a plate caught it on that big plate and presented his prey to the tsar archidei. the second simeon bowed and ran quickly even forgetting to put on his cap. and that king has not a small army. where others require a year she takes but a day and where other ships take ten years mine will take let us say a week. i will pour gold and silver over that one. the tsar grew angry he seemed to be ready for a terrible word. why so deep in thought have you already forgotten the seventh simeon but do not forget that he must take ten years time to reach us and in ten years ah me exclaimed the tsar archidei forgetting even his anger. i certainly shall reward thee. cheerfully laughed the seventh simeon. once said quickly done. answer what kind of people are ye we want to sell to buy and to exchange. when she looked at one it was like receiving a gift and when she walked it was like the graceful swimming of a swan. we came to sell to buy to exchange moreover we have gifts for the king and his princess. give me thy permission to go on board their wonderful ship to choose what things i like. meanwhile the guards kept watch. the seventh simeon showed the lovely guests everywhere. what should they do they directed the vessel back to the island and appeared before the king with their terrible tale. i never wanted thee to marry. no king no prince would i consider worthy of thee and now oh what were you thinking about you shall all lose your heads she hastily walked to the deck of the ship and behold only the wide sea was around her like a mirror where was her native island where the royal vessel there was nothing visible but the blue sea. the princess screamed struck her white bosom with both hands transformed herself into a white swan and flew high into the sky. but the fifth simeon watching closely lost no time snapped his lucky gun and the white swan was shot. his brother the sixth simeon caught the white swan but lo instead of the white swan there was a silvery fish which slipped away from him. simeon caught the fish but the pretty silvery fish turned into a small mouse running around the ship. on a lovely morning a week later the tsar archidei was sitting by the window of his palace lost in thought. his eyes were turned toward the sea the wide blue sea. what is that far away upon the waters or are those white wings not wings but sails how happy is the tsar archidei the tsar himself came out to meet the beautiful princess took her white hands and helped her into the palace. said the tsar archidei. yet though i admire thee i do not want to separate thee from thy father. say the word and my faithful servants will take thee back to him. well what more is there to be said you certainly can imagine the rest. simeon the seventh shouted aloud from the deck. thanks take as much gold as you wish. take silver also and ask for whatever is your hearts desire. everything shall be given you with my mighty hand. we are but simple people and simple are our ways. we do not care for thy treasures either. we have our own fathers field which shall always give us bread for hunger and money for need. let us go home taking with us thy gracious word as our reward. and do we pray thee pardon the seventh simeon our youngest brother. soon after this the wedding was celebrated. if you like it praise it if not let it be forgotten. the story is told and a word is like a sparrow once out it is out for good. the language of the birds 
somewhere in a town in holy russia there lived a rich merchant with his wife. he had an only son a dear bright and brave boy called ivan. one lovely day ivan sat at the dinner table with his parents. ivan took notice of these words and no matter where he went no matter where he was no matter what he did he always thought of how he could learn the language of the birds. some time after this the merchants son happened to be hunting in a forest. ivan soon came near a large tree and saw a big nest in the branches. four small birds were in the nest they were quite alone and neither father nor mother was there to protect them from the cold and wet. ivan remained in the forest three days. he understood well the teaching of the big bird and returned home more clever than before. one beautiful day soon after this ivan sat with his parents when the nightingale was singing in his cage. his song was so sad however so very sad that the merchant and his wife also became sad and their son their good ivan who listened very attentively was even more affected and the tears came running down his cheeks. replied the son. for a long time the boat danced on the waves and finally it came near a large merchant vessel which struck against it with such a shock that ivan awoke. so they decided to take him along with them and did so. but no one paid any attention and they went farther on. when they were through with their work they heard many wild swans flying above them and talking very loud among themselves. inquired the men this time with interest. when the danger was over the sailors with ivan went farther still farther. no one knew how to get rid of them and no one could kill them. finally he made the sign of the cross and went to the palace. the servants obeyed and ivan listened for a while. as soon as the king announced his royal decision the crow father with the crow son went one way and the crow mother disappeared the other way and no one has heard the noisy birds since. in the meantime his father the rich merchant lost his wife and by and by his fortune also. he said. the old man was not only clever he was wise. two of them were almost as clever. they were married and had children but ivan the youngest was single. no one cared much for him because he was rather a fool could not count one two three and only drank or ate or slept or lay around. why care for such a person every one knows life for some is brighter than for others. and that is why all liked ivan and usually called him ivanoushka the simpleton though the name means fool at the same time it carries the idea of a kind heart. our old man lived on with his sons until finally his hour came to die. two of the brothers as clever people promised their father to do according to his bidding but the simpleton did not even promise he only scratched his head. the old man died and was buried. lo the simpleton arrived home and went to the warm stove. asked the brothers. he took along with him a piece of fish pie went to the grave and slept. midnight approached the wind roared crows came flying the grave opened and the old man came out. he asked. at midnight his father came out. he asked. and lo ivanoushka the simpleton beheld a horse running the earth trembling under his hoofs his eyes like stars and out of his mouth and ears smoke coming in a cloud. the horse approached and stood before the old man. he asked with a mans voice. the old man crawled into his left ear washed and adorned himself and jumped out of his right ear as a young brave fellow never seen before. the brothers again asked. but the simpleton did not even answer he only waved his hand. they lived a day in and an equal day out. but one morning there came quite a different day from all others. sometimes the tsar mentioned to her this or that one. the great day arrived. the people below were roaring like an ocean. there were already several fellows who had tried. the brothers of ivanoushka the simpleton were preparing themselves to go to the field also. the glorious horse came running. he jumped onto the horse and touched his iron sides with a silk whip. the horse became impatient lifted himself above the ground higher and higher above the dark woods below the traveling clouds. he swam over the large rivers jumped over the small ones as well as over hills and mountains. every one was roaring in amazement. the brothers of ivanoushka came home and there was but one subject of conversation what a splendid fellow they had seen what a wonderful start to pass through the thirty circles ivanoushka the simpleton crawled into the left ear of the horse and when he appeared out of the right ear oh my what a fellow he was ivanoushka lifted himself on the iron back of his horse and touched him with a strong whip. the noble horse grew angry made a jump and went higher than the dark woods a little below the traveling clouds. one jump one mile is behind a second jump a river is behind and a third jump and they were at the hall. the brothers of ivanoushka the simpleton came home. they were wondering at the fellow. the horse asked with a mans voice. ivanoushka the simpleton crawled into his right ear and jumped out of his left one and a handsome fellow he was. a young girl could not even imagine such a one. ivanoushka struck his horse pulled the bridle tight and lo he flew high up in the air. how the wild horse did jump look there well she did not object. she even adorned his forehead with a diamond star. but the fellow had already disappeared and no traces were left behind. but who is he every one had to appear at the royal palace and show his forehead. i myself struck the door with my forehead. the brothers laughed and went. and they laughed. ivanoushka the simpleton gave no heed to their bidding but refused. behold the star was shining in the middle of his forehead. it was too late to object. there was fine eating and generous drinking. the tsar immediately called the brothers before him and bade them bring at once the wonderful tree the apple tree with silver leaves and golden apples. toward the east where grew the wonderful apple tree with silver leaves and golden apples. it grew near silver waters upon golden sand. his ride was long and he felt tired. along the same road came his brothers. they perceived the tent with silver top and near by the wonderful apple tree. exclaimed the brothers. then they awakened ivanoushka and wanted to buy the apple tree. the brothers thought the matter over and finally decided to give the desired price. at that time ivanoushka the simpleton made up his mind to take a trip somewhere. then he ordered his faithful horse crawled into one ear and jumped out of the other. one two three and they were in dark woods. she was eating roots and after her followed twelve little pigs. on the same road the brothers came along with gloomy faces not knowing what to say to the tsar. the brothers looked into the tent. ivanoushka again the tsar was glad to have such faithful servants. but a pig remains a pig forever. the brothers went two sad heroes. their march was slow where to go they did not know. ivanoushka also jumped upon a stick and went leaping toward the field. our ivanoushka journeyed and journeyed how long we do not know until at last he arrived at that island struggled three days with the dragon and killed him on the fourth day. then he began to tear down the locks. that took three days more. the brothers came along gloomy they were fearing the tsars anger. lo they looked at him opened wide their eyes and remained silent. he finished and laid out ears fingers and toes. one was sent to feed the pigs another to watch the turkeys. the poor brother in spite of all his trouble and all his work had none whatever. the poor man lost patience and complained bitterly of his ill luck. he had no more courage and his head dropped heavily on his breast. one day he decided to call upon his wealthy brother for aid. answered the rich man. there is wealth enough but look here there is also plenty of work to be done. one week passed two weeks passed. the poor fellow remained. the rich merchant thanked his guests for their love and bowing low begged his dear guests to eat drink and enjoy themselves. he had nothing to eat nothing to drink. he bowed even lower than they did and expressed more thanks than they. he stopped. the voice stopped too. he sang and the voice continued again. shouted the poor man beside himself. ha i am bitter woe. i pity all weak people. the poor fellow had no strength to throw him off so he crawled along his way the long hard way with woe on his shoulders. woe would ask when the poor man sighed. the poor man obeyed. they went and spent all in drink. his wife was sad his little children were hungry and in tears but he under the influence of woe and wine danced and sang. they looked inside. under the stone there was a pit a dark deep pit. at the bottom of that pit something was twinkling. woe jumped in and laughed out loud. and very successful he was too. within a year he earned much money and in place of the old hut built a fine new log cabin. one bright day he went into town to ask his rich brother with his wife and children to do him the favor of coming to a feast which was to be given in the new home. exclaimed the rich brother. but at the same time he got very anxious to know how it was with his poor brother so he went without delay to the new place. when he arrived there he could not believe his eyes. his poor brother seemed to be quite rich perhaps richer than himself. the brother who had been poor related everything about woe how he decided to deceive him and how free from such a burden he was getting to be a very happy man. out of so many pots to take only one fool and nothing but fool no sooner thought than done. the rich brother said goodby and went away but did not go to his wealthy home. no he hurried to the stone. the rich man felt a burden oh what a heavy burden looked around and perceived the hideous monster. thou didst want to let me perish in that pit but no woe would not go. the monster laughed and laughed. his wealth was soon lost but his brother who knew how to get rid of woe was prosperous and is prosperous to this day. one year passed and two years and even longer. and so he did and had children by his second wife. she scolded them without any reason sent them away from home as often as she wished and gave them scarcely enough to eat. finally she wanted to get rid of them altogether. do you know what it means to allow a wicked thought to enter ones heart a wicked feeling was growing in the stepmothers heart and she determined to send the children to the witch thinking sure enough that they would never return. but instead of going to the witch the sister a bright little girl took her brother by the hand and ran to their own old old grandmother and told her all about their going to the forest. you have to go not to a loving grandmother but to a wicked witch. there stood a hut and what a curious one the hut did as they commanded. the little girl willingly did so. then away they flew through the air. then they both returned to the hut and on the threshold met the black cat. if you hear her once more throw down the comb and in place of the comb there will appear a dark wood. nearly scared to death from fear they lay there afraid to talk afraid even to breathe. so they went farther and farther and ran out of the dark forest into the wide sunny fields. she shouted and began to beat the cat. again the children heard her hurry after them and so they threw down the comb. the witch tried very hard to pass through but in vain and so very very angry she returned home. the father was touched and became angry. he sent the wicked stepmother away and lived a new life with his good children. from that time he watched over their happiness and never neglected them any more. how do i know this story is true why one was there who told me about it. sometimes for instance he would invite one of his neighbors and treat his guest with fine things to eat and to drink. the fellow guest speedily ate everything up. how could i dare not take it but what to do a rich proud merchant worth many many thousands came along in a gilded carriage. all the fellows at the market place as soon as they perceived him rushed away and hid themselves in the corners. only one remained and this one was our merchants son. the next day early in the morning our merchants son arrived at the landing the very rich merchant was already there waiting. for quite a long time they journeyed and finally they perceived an island. upon that island there were high mountains and near the shore something seemed to be in flames. they landed came ashore and look there the family met they greeted one another and went to the palace. they sat around the oak table and ate and drank and were cheerful. she left the room and made him a sign to follow her. the fellow drank and fell asleep. finally shouted the master. the proud rich merchant was off. thought the poor merchants son. the poor merchants son took out stone and flint struck it once and lo two brave fellows were standing before him. said they. and at once the two took hold of him and carefully brought him down. our hero walks along the shore. see there a vessel comes sailing near the island. good people and they went sailing by. it was a long time or perhaps only a short time after who could tell the same very rich merchant came along in his gilded carriage and as of old all the fellows who saw him coming rushed away. the merchants son remained alone. thou art the head thou must drink the first. the proud merchant drank and fell sound asleep. when the merchant awoke he looked here and looked there and looked everywhere. the proud rich merchant had to obey and dug and dug. shouted the merchants son. and the rich merchant the proud rich merchant well sometimes it happens just so. what on earth could have been done the old father grew sad began even to weep but nevertheless helped the young girl into the sleigh. he was afraid his wife was watching them out of the window. and so he went with his lovely daughter into the wide wide fields drove her nearly to the woods left her there alone and speedily drove away he was a good man and did not care to see his daughters death. alone quite alone remained the sweet girl. again asked the frost. he was exceedingly pleased with her looks and mild manners. but the frost however knew all about the weakness of human beings he knew very well that few of them are really good and kind but he knew no one of them even could struggle too long against the power of frost the king of winter. what a rich girl she became and how many magnificent garments she received when the young girl put it on she became such a beautiful maiden that even the sun smiled at her. the old man went off. shouted the stepmother and struck the little dog. somebody opened the gate voices were heard laughing and talking outside. the old woman looked out and sat down in amazement. old frost was there he looked at his new guest. the gate opened the old woman ran out and kissed the stiff frozen lips of her daughter. snowwhite

the house. the stones might almost have been flung together by a boy at play yet rough as they were they fitted close and kept the weather out. to this end they looked in at the windows which stood open all summer long and saw many things which must have surprised them. i said that the trees stood well back from the house in the wood. a hollow surely there never was such a wood for birds praise was it or profession of belief or simply of joy of being alive and able to sing under green leaves and summer sun the child. the child had grown tired of the road. she might be a hundred little girls she thought instead of one. by and by as i said she grew tired of this and it was a new joy to see the little river that came running along just then. that was what the child sang for she had a way of singing when she was alone. then somehow all at once there began to be trees along by the river side. said the child. she laughed aloud at the idea and looked round again full of joy and wonder. it was pretty enough surely. by and by there was a stone so big that its top stood out dry and brown above the water. that was a great pleasure to be really part of the brook or of the rock. she laughed aloud suddenly and kicked a little till the bright drops flew over her head then she began to sing and talk both together. where is that child we seed her going into the store and we seed her going into the house and we seed her running about all over the place. yes honest injun well then i wont tell you said the child. she frowned thoughtfully but soon shook her head. hed have had gold spots on his green and this frog hadnt a single one he hadnt. well she went away and left me first and that was how it was. when i come to some fairies ill make more. only some of them would go the wrong way over into the shadow. she shouted to them. you are a stupid you are she scrambled out hastily but this time on the bank. she had had enough of the brook and was red with anger. she said. she shook her head at the brook and turned away. said the child. there seemed no doubt about that. there was no sign of a path anywhere. the child had never known fear and it did not come to her now. she reflected for a moment then her brow cleared. she announced to the brook. of course there was a house somewhere there always was in every wood. but the best house on the whole would be the dwarf house. yes that was the one to look for. and then you stayed and cooked for them just like snowwhite and and it was just lovely said the child. she would sweep the old womans house and give her half her own bread only she had no bread it should not come in she shook her head and pressed on. it was all right god was close by anyhow and he had to take care of children because he said he would. so it was all right only 
suddenly the child stopped for it was all right. she had found the house in the wood. no this was the house of the seven dwarfs and she was really in a fairy story and she was going to have the best time she had ever had in her life. the child stood quiet for a few minutes looking in pure delight. perhaps one of the dwarfs would come out. she thought she might feel a little shy if one were to come out just this very minute. then she remembered that they must all be out at work in the forest for they always were and they did not come back till night. she said decidedly. she advanced boldly across the green but paused again at the door. no sound came from the house. two steps and she stood inside. the room in which she stood was not large except for dwarfs for them it would be a great hall. it was on seeing this table that the child began to fear all was not quite right. there was only one at this table. what did this mean just ill take a little bit as snowwhite did. she seated herself at the table and poured some milk into the cup. oh how good it was the man. i i mean im laughing because you look so funny. the dwarf advanced toward her and she held on to the back of the chair but he held out his hand and smiled. he said. he said. ill sit down here and you shall give me some milk. i am hungry too. he nodded at her and smiled again he had the most delightful smile the child had ever seen. somebody once said you could warm yourself at it as at a fire. no indeed he had brown hair and a soft brown beard his eyes were brown too and full of light. he seemed all of a piece with the house and the gray rock behind it. now he looked at her and smiled again. said the child. said the man. this is all there is. he smiled still but this time it was only his mouth and his eyes looked dark as if something hurt him. asked the man. said the child. said the man. he was silent for a moment as if he were thinking then he laughed and the child laughed too. she said. said the man. but there arent any more dwarfs. the child thought that was a pity. said the man. said the child. said the man. no the child did not mind at all. so he brought a most beautiful pipe and filled and lighted it then he sat down and looked at the child thoughtfully. said the child. its somewhere else a long way off. i cant go back there. dwarfs never send people back there they let them stay and do the work. it was glorious fun washing the dishes such pretty dishes blue and white with houses and birds on them. they went into the kitchen through one of the doors and there all the things were bright and shining as if they were made of silver. said the child. there was a frog too and he came and said things to me but i kicked at him. do you know the frog prince does he live here in this river said snowwhite. did ever the dwarf do that it was fun she left them away back there miles away before she came to the river and the woods. and her hat 
she laughed suddenly. and it was fun. she asked. he led her through the other door and there was a tiny bedroom all shining and clean like the other rooms. she said. said the man. when he finished the child seemed to be asleep too but she roused herself once more. she sat up on his knee and rubbed her eyes. the mans eyes looked dark again. he said putting out his hands as if to push the child away. she said. the man stood looking at her a long time. he went to a box and took out a folded paper. asking questions. asked the child. they were sitting at breakfast the next morning. to look at the child no one would have thought she had ever been sleepy in her life she was twinkling all over with eagerness and curiosity. can you hang up by your heels in trees asked the child slightly disappointed. if you did sleep where did you please give me some more bread. i dont see where you get bread and i dont see where you slept and you didnt tell me how many birds you had. said the child. but as to the birds how many should you think there were when i woke up they were singing and singing as if they were seeing who could most. and then he flew away just as hard as he could fly. im sorry you frightened him away snowwhite. if you had kept quiet he would have sung you a pretty song. to him. i dont think you are very polite. said the man gravely. cried the child. standing still among them the man talked to them gently and they seemed to understand. it was a very wonderful thing if any one had been there who understood about wonderful things but to the child it seemed wholly natural being like many other matters in the fairy books only she wished she could do it too and determined she would as soon as she learned a little more about the ways of dwarfs. the child was at the door in a moment. she asked eagerly. why cant i do it too what is their names of all those birds cried the child. said the child with a sigh of relief. but first i must ask you some questions snowwhite. the child came slowly and seated herself as she was bid. i made a song too. she said opening her eyes wide at the man. yes the man liked it very much but she was not answering his question. dont i truly sing dont you think i was a bird if you didnt see me the dwarf said he was not going to answer any more questions. she said again. and i told them i said if they did then i would and they would and so i did. asked the child with quick sympathy. is it here is it in your front often i have them in my front. the man did not answer this time. he said and then one saw that he had got the weight up. said the child. said the man. asked the child. said the man. say is all dwarfs funny arent there really any more of you didnt there ever was where did the rest of them go why do you stay in this place alone the child opened her eyes at him. said the man hastily. she said. she said in conclusion. is you got any name the man admitted. arent you funny truly is it your name but the man declared he had lost his way in the questions. but we must do the dishes now and then ill show you where i slept last night. that would be great the child thought. on the whole she thought perhaps he was the right kind of dwarf after all. why did he have a hump on his back though not in the snowwhite picture they did. wasnt it funny when she stood on the cricket she was just as tall as he wasnt that nice didnt he think he was made that way just for little girls did ever he see any little girls before did he think she looked like snowwhite why didnt he talk when she spoke to him it appeared that he was an extraordinary person after all and quite like the books. he lived here all alone. yes always alone. how did he know that did ever he see mamma what made him look so queer in his eyes poor dwarf well why werent there any more dwarfs anyhow it appeared that he did not want any more. it appeared that when he came away he never wished to see anybody again as long as he lived. why didnt he want to see people had they been horrid to him yes they had been very horrid. he came away into the woods to stay till he was tired and then he was going farther away. where oh he did not know to wherever he belonged he was not sure where it was but he knew the way to get there. no not by the brook that was too slow he knew a quick way. show it to her well no he thought not. how long had he been here oh a good while. asked the child. often i do the child grew red in the face. she said. look a good way up just above that great branch do you see a hole well in there is a hollow big enough to sit in or lie down and sleep in. would you like to come up and see snowwhite im glad you were here. how i shall get up stand on your hump isnt it nice you have a hump dwarf was it made for little girls to stand up on did you have them make it did you think about little girls when you had it made do you like to have it for me to stand on could she put her arms round that and hang for just a moment yes she could and did and in an instant the active dwarf was beside her and had her up on the branch beside him. anything new the man said it was more than a month. said the dwarf looking up at the tree. he remarked easily. a man like you living this life the life of an animal sir its monstrous. said the dwarf. a before i forget it i want you to get me some things in town. you see i am calm if only you wouldnt make me laugh too much. now well come in and go over the papers. he said. parents away from home. pretty little girl six years old image of her mother. he said. come and let me see this business whatever it is. curse the whole of it deed and house land and letter when the child woke she was at first too much surprised to speak. instead here she was in what kind of place on the one side where they were not she looked out into a green sky or perhaps no it wasnt a sky it was woods very thick woods and there was no ground at all. now some of the rustling came alive and two or three birds hopped down from somewhere and sat on her foot and sang. at that the child laughed aloud instead of screaming as she had just been beginning to think she might and then in a moment there was the dwarf looking in at the green entrance smiling and nodding at her. said the child. isnt it a funny place dwarf how did you get here what made you know about it why dont you always live here all the time now the dwarf and the child were exactly the right size and there seemed no reason why they should not live here all their lives. this was evident to the child. the child repeated. the man took the object down but did not give it to her. said the child. what for a key is it to where did you get it all kinds of places. he was speaking slowly and for the time seemed to forget the child and to be speaking to himself. asked the child. the man looked at her with startled eyes. he repeated. isnt that awful would you go in just the same said the dwarf and he laughed not his pleasant laugh but one that sounded more like a bark the child told him. the child considered him attentively. she said. she cried. and then you turned brown didnt you you dont suppose ill turn brown do you because i aint green am i he was a pretty bad sort of fellow was he snowwhite yes the dwarf wanted that very much indeed. i suppose you knew lots and lots of them didnt you was they blue and green and red what made you turn brown when you was green well did ever you eat a cake like that should you think it would be nasty i should well and so there was the yellow dwarf sitting in the tree why just the way you are dwarf. we might play i was the queen and you was the yellow dwarf. well he said he would save her from the lion if she would let him marry the princess and she didnt want to one bit but she said she supposed shed have to so he saved her and she found herself right back there in the palace. why im only six and i dont eat so many as all that only till i feel queer in front and then i always stop. do always you stop when you feel queer in front well my mother promised me to you in marriage you such a fright as you wasnt he mean what does it look like why do you have it if it gets cold so easy as that i wouldnt well said the dwarf bitterly. they were just as brave thats all about the first part. i want to know what became of them. even if the dwarf did carry off the princess and even if she had promised to marry him for she did promise you say still of course he did not get her. and thats all. and thats all. arent you going to get me something to eat cant we have it up here in this place arent you glad im here to keep you company and tell you stories dont you say hurrah for us dwarf said the child. they had had dinner a most exciting dinner all coming out of tin boxes and delightful china pots. the child shut her eyes and said what she wanted and when she opened them there it mostly was standing on the table before her. asked the child. like that hard just as loud as you can do you no the dwarf could not do it now he had not the right kind of shoes on. besides there were other reasons. asked the child again. oh that was exciting was it a truly cow did it turn into things all day and be a cow at night or the other way what did it turn into could he be things if he wanted to would he said the child. said the dwarf. you havent showed me any yet not any at all. but stealing is wicked dont you know that can dwarfs do it the child was greatly relieved. that made it all right she assured him. always everybody could keep the things they found though of course the wicked fairies and dragons tried to get the treasure away. she explained. cried the child. we will run all the way. are you glad i am said the man. he would be her horse now he said and give her a good ride. and wasnt the hump comfortable to sit on now she must hold on tight and he would trot. he trotted gently through the green wood and the child shouted with joy and jumped up and down on the hump. it was a round smooth hump and made a good seat. were they tame she asked the dwarf said she should judge for herself. they sat down and he bade her keep still and then gave a queer whistle. they sat up on the brown needles and looked at the dwarf with bright asking eyes. one big gray fellow made a little bow and that was charming to see. said the dwarf. i taught him to do that snowwhite. this is only snowwhite. she has come to do my cooking and all my work and she will not touch you. simeon if you are greedy youll get no more. asked the child. but why couldnt he get down but how did he get up what did he have to eat and as for getting down he just didnt. he stayed there. he used to let down a basket every day or whenever he was hungry and people put food in it and then he pulled it up. what did they put the child sprang up and clapped her hands. said the dwarf. in the hole it will be just as good as little kid milk. said the dwarf. now soon we are coming to the cow. but it was not easy to hurry. but could he buy things was there a place here where he dug them up when would he show it to her the name was very funny she thought. aint it funny any money all its white just like milk. asked the dwarf. the child clapped her hands and danced. she cried. do you love her why see her walk did you think i wound her up the child brushed these remarks aside with a wave. she whispered putting her mouth close to the dwarfs ear. she drew back and pointed a stern finger at him. the dwarf was very humble. so far as he knew he said she was a real cow. i think it would be awkward to have a princess. they lay with their rosy cheeks close against the moss and seemed to laugh out at the child and she laughed too and danced for joy and put some of them in her hair. he looked lovely she told him with the pink flowers in his gray coat she said she didnt care much if he never turned into anything he was nice enough the way he was and the dwarf said it was just as well and he was glad to hear it. and then the child said he was a horrid old thing and she wouldnt now anyhow and perhaps she wouldnt at all ever in her life and anyhow not till she went to bed. the story. then i will. she held up her frock and the dwarf looked at it anxiously. it was certainly very dirty. said the dwarf. youll have to get me another. she hoped it would be blue because she was tired of this pink one. he said. he opened a deep carved chest that stood in a corner the smell that came from it was sweet and old and seemed to belong to far countries. he hunted in the corners and presently brought out a folded paper soft and foreign looking. and hastened out. i told him he mustnt and he will. the child opened great eyes at him. cried the child. yes but that was different the dwarf said. no he didnt think it would be of any use to stamp his foot and say to bring a blue dress this minute. but look here wouldnt this do but it was the most beautiful thing in the world the child said. but it was better than dresses ever and ever so much better because there were no buttons. and she might dress up in it that would be fun but it was on the big table in the long parlour and he could see it any time he went in but any time if his hands were clean. always he had to show his hands to make sure they were clean. and she would be like the pictures and he was a very nice dwarf and she loved him. now the child said to the dwarf was the time for him to tell her a story. what story she had not been sure that he would know the right way to tell a story but he did and it was all right. cried the child. not a man a dwarf ill begin again if you like. said the child. she drew the blue shawl around her and sighed with pleasure. that was unfortunate you see for he had some things born with him that a dwarf has no business with. what things the trouble was his mother let him grow up thinking he was a man. she loved him very much you see and she was a foolish woman. the child asked. but he thought that other women other people were like his mother you see and they werent that was all. the story had been rather stupid so far but now things were going to begin. did he live in a gold house she asked. was there a princess in it when was he going to tell her about her why didnt he go on he was rich i say and for that reason everybody made believe that he was a man and treated him like one. silly yes very silly. was he green i hope not. the child was trying hard to be good but her patience gave out at last the man was silent so long. i think this is a stupid story. didnt anything happen to him at all this is a slow story snowwhite and you must have patience. didnt he know this one very well perhaps was there another he knowed better was there dragons no she didnt let her hair down and there were no dragons quite the contrary the door was always open always open and the way seemed clear. but she was beautiful and he fell in love with her. oh yes yes as you say they always do. for a long time a very long time he did not dare to think of its being possible that she could love him. he would have been content content and thankful just to be her friend just to be allowed to see her now and then and take her hand and feel her smile through and through him like wine. the dwarf looked at the child with eyes that seemed not to see her but something beyond her. said the child promptly. she said she would marry him. she looked at him with her soft eyes and said she loved him. at any rate it was the best he could build. and he filled it full of things what kind of things let me tell a little bit now mark. may i said the dwarf. it doesnt matter what became of the dwarf does it he was only a dwarf you know. the story always ends when the prince and princess are married. the child reflected with a puzzled look. but arent you stupid and besides them all was horrid and this was a nice dwarf. but as to this other dwarf there isnt very much to tell. he travelled and saw strange places and people. but where was it but he never thought then he didnt think much about it. so did i say his mother was dead so i did oh well never mind that now. so he bought a key that would open the door of that country yes something like that thing i called a key and then he came to a place well it was something like this place snowwhite. he wanted to be quiet you see for some time before he went away. the man started and looked at her. i think this is enough story dont you you see i was right it didnt matter what became of the dwarf. the key of the fields. was he speaking to the bird or was it merely that the sound of his own voice had grown friendly to him during these silent years he went on. see now. she they went away and left their treasure. i did not send them away did i no fault of mine in that at least. fate or something call it god if you like brought the treasure to my door have i no right to keep it for a little at least the joy i might have and i have not had too much perhaps. they have each other. i could make her happy i could fill her little hands full full. she should have all the things that are waiting there shut up those and as many more ten times over. we might have our play for a few weeks or a few months and then when she was tired no before she was tired oh surely before that i would give her back. give her back and how should i do that he moved his foot tossing the bird up in the air. you find me pleasant to live with you took all else i had take now this also as a gift from the dwarf. i think i could bring the trouble into her eyes and the colour into her soft pale cheeks. if only she would not speak wait for her here under the tree. it might be a time like this the little one asleep up there. oh i dont know how greatly you value it a child a little girl who wandered here some time ago. she is asleep now up in her favourite chamber in yonder tree. oh i would gladly keep her and i think it might not be difficult at least she has never tried to run away but we are old neighbours and i thought it right to let you know that she was here. yes by heaven love no lying here just let things take their own course let fate or god if you like have right of way do the work without me. he is capable surely the child is here very well let them find her since they lost her. they are sure to do that. it would be a pity if they could not find this bit of forest only a few miles from the town. surely here she is. how should i know whose child it was living so retired take her how often he could not tell how often but when the child was gone he would not stay behind alone. it would be different now he must make haste to be gone on his journey that is if there were a journey he had no knowledge that he might not see his mothers face and feel her hand on his head. there was no proof against it. then if it might be he would tell her all as he had so often told her alone here in the wood. sleep meantime he was alive on a day like this that was where he often sat. yet that was his kind of note surely was he speaking no the sound came from above. oh what is that voice above oh yes there is marks silver key what looks like a pistol. well mark said i mustnt well of course i wont only just ill take it down and see what it is. mark is it death they are staring at lo now death has laughed and reached behind him and taken his own. o god can this thing be but hark oh hark o god once more what sound now from above no no bird ever sobbed in its throat no bird ever cried through tears like this. i want you mark when the child was going to bed that night the dwarf took her in his arms and held her a long long time silent. hold hands with me so i like that prayer. the child drew a long sigh of content and put up her arms. through the long night those tender arms held her. restored to life. and always so wise so kind with the light in his eyes and the smile that people would turn in the street to look after. and on all this had come the second surprise. so it had seemed at least but now it appeared that yet worse might be. what must happen what did it mean to him thus riding in state and misery came i say the third great surprise of his life. mark the horses is white just the way you said. oh i do love you who is that is it a man is he real does he wind up behind what for is his mouth open said the dwarf laughing. see snowwhite the carriage has stopped now and we will get in and go home to mamma. oh said the child. both together we are coming back to live parts of the times do you think all day those crumbs will last them do you do you think simeon is lonely poor simeon why dont you speak and tell me mark she put her mouth to his ear. the child wanted to know why the ribbons were there and whether it was a party and a party for her but for once no one answered her. was it true could it be true who had seen her was the child found was she alive yes he said it was true. yes she was alive and well had no hurt of any kind. he had come back his own house was to be opened he would be at the office tomorrow. cried several eager voices. for here was a fresh wonder almost as great as that of the dead restored to life. goodbye. the birds did not know what to make of it. now he was gone and the birds did not know what to make of it. moreover all was as usual in the place below where their friend lived only he was not there. he had found some nuts but intended to keep them for his trouble and so he departed. in his hand he brings the child growing every year into new beauty new grace and brightness. says the child. the end. would you like to go to grandmothers today my child the sun is bright and the air is warm and pleasant.

greatly enjoy for it is full of the tales of the mighty king arthur and his knights of the round table. the book is so lovely. let me take it lady mother queen. i would that the children of my royal husband could read the book. our father does not think much of books and music. and i love to hunt but i love to hear the stories of great kings and warriors too. alfred. to which of us wilt thou give the book lady mother queen. alfred. will you really dear mother queen. yes upon the faith of a queen i will. i will not give it to one who cannot read it. books are meant for the learned and not for the ignorant. the sons of a king should cease to play with toys. alfred. may i take the book a little while queen. alfred. thank you lady mother. i shall study the book and learn to read for i wish to know all about the brave knights of arthurs court. scene ii. all the others have gone back to their homes. in no other way can ye serve me. alfred. i do not despair. the time is not ripe now for further war. i trust that the time will come when we shall drive them from our land. but we must do that which seems best for the present and seek to be more successful in the future. we must not sit down and weep no this rather shall you do. go back to your own people and keep me in their memory. then gather the soldiers and i shall come to lead them to victory. thou shalt be obeyed my royal lord. i will return to my men and do as thou hast said. well will i serve thee my royal lord. it is not well for the king to fare alone. alfred. i am well content to serve myself or even to be servant to others until a happier time shall come. when the time comes that we may again fight for our country let him bring me the welcome message. farewell my royal master since thou wilt have it so. and may the time soon come when i shall bring the message to thee alfred. all will be well. scene iii. save you good father alfred. alfred. alfred. follow me then and thou shalt have thy desire. well i hear thee a guest i see by this light that our guest hath not been used to beg for charity from such as thou. i have heard that charity begins at home and i am sure we are poor enough. not poor enough to refuse food to the hungry such as it is. alfred. thanks for your goodness kind host. indeed i am hungry. you eat like a hungry wolf. alfred. and now i am hungry no longer. i thank you both for a good supper and i hope you will never be sorry you have given charity to a stranger. this way then to the bed of straw. alfred. alfred. i shall be careful. scene iv. alfred. gladly will i watch them. show me what i must do. turn them often before the fire thus so that they will not burn. now i will go for more wood for the fire. alfred. how long i wonder must i remain in hiding. it is very hard to wait. so many plans have i for their happiness and progress. roads must be built and the country made safe for all. oh thou lazy useless fellow thou art ready enough to eat the cakes but too lazy to keep them from burning. no wonder thou hast no home idle as thou art. alfred. i pray thee good dame forgive me. i was lost in thought of happier days and forgot my duty. really i am sorry. ay ay that is always the way with thee. however i shall set by all the burnt cakes for thy portion of the weeks bread i promise thee and thou shalt have no other till they are all eaten. alfred. alfred. but mistress may i not give him that which was to have been my portion for dinner no indeed alfred. very well then. alfred. i hunger for good news. alfred. what alfred. they believed they had us in their power and they never dreamed we would leave the castle walls. alfred. the time is ripe. your father is a noble man and i shall know how to show a kings gratitude to you both. shall we go lead on king alfred england is ready. robin hood and his men making arrows. robin hood. this feather is too short. give me another little john. this is a better one. making arrows is not a simple thing is it my

farewell. they had seen him walking through the wood and then when they left off playing he had come to sit down beside them and asked them their names. the childrens faces grew grave. father waited and waited but it wasnt any good. the old gentleman smiled. ill show you. at last the sail came after ten long years. only his brother knew him by his eyes for they two had loved each other very much. oh the beautiful snow not such fun as it seemed. they waited until her head was turned away then off they ran. they waited on and on hoping some one would come for them and fearing every moment that the sea would cover the rock and that they would be drowned. old clothes. that seems queer to me i cant quite believe it. but i want to tell you what a queer thing happened to mine not long ago. and now the event happened that i promised to tell you about. you will hardly believe me. we all know that new clothes hurt sometimes but old ones oh if only i could get out of this at last i grew desperate. this choked tight feeling was too much. but oh so tender and so nervous then i glanced at the new me. he keeps his hands above water now and me at arms length. the little tiny thing. she touched the honey in the spoon with a blade of grass and tenderly put a drop of it before the little ant. he tried to run. she felt ashamed. has such a little tiny thing a real home of his own this is a little nurse ant. on sunny days they carry their babies out and let them lie in the sun. on cold days they take them downstairs away from the cold wind and the rain. who taught you to spell but it is not a bad idea all the same. they never lose their way. what do you think i saw the other day this was worse than if a cannon ball were to fall from the sky on one of us. he lay under it not able to move. what shall i do and then he ran off up the path. they looked as if they were telling one another what a dreadful accident it was and how nobody knew whose turn would come next. after this they set to work with a will. in a little while back came the ant with a troop of friends. dont be silly dolly. even if the sails do get wet tom can get fresh ones. and now all his work was gone. ah here was something particularly good today. but he did feel a little guilty when he heard his mother calling. off he ran and was back in the nest again by the time his mother had finished rubbing her eyes after her nap. presently he found a dear little wooden house and there hung the cheese just inside it. when the morning came the cook who had set the trap lifted it from the shelf and then called a pretty little girl to come and see the thief who had eaten her cake. oh and with it and what she sold her butter for she bought a little black pig. the bat assured him that he was not a bird but a mouse and thus was set free. the bat assured him that he was not a mouse but a bat and thus a second time escaped. it is wise to turn circumstances to good account. the lion and the mouse 
a lion was awakened from sleep by a mouse running over his face. it happened shortly after this that the lion was caught by some hunters who bound him by strong ropes to the ground. they tried with all their strength and were not able to do it. the wolf and the crane 
a wolf who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a crane for a large sum to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. the dog and the shadow 
a dog crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in his mouth saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that of another dog with a piece of meat double his own in size. he immediately let go of his own and fiercely attacked the other dog to get his larger piece from him. he thus lost both that which he grasped at in the water because it was a shadow and his own because the stream swept it away. on the day appointed for the race the two started together. the tortoise never for a moment stopped but went on with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. besides i am no crane i am a stork a bird of excellent character and see how i love and slave for my father and mother. the farmer and the snake 
one winter a farmer found a snake stiff and frozen with cold. he had compassion on it and taking it up placed it in his bosom. the mountain in labor 
a mountain was once greatly agitated. they had not proceeded far when they met a lion. the lion seeing that the ass was secured immediately clutched the fox and attacked the ass at his leisure. the man and the lion 
a man and a lion traveled together through the forest. a goat overcome with thirst came to the same well and seeing the fox inquired if the water was good. the bear and the two travelers 
two men were traveling together when a bear suddenly met them on their path. one of them climbed up quickly into a tree and concealed himself in the branches. the bear soon left him for it is said he will not touch a dead body. why do you make so much noise he soon discovered the secret of the hidden treasure and digging down came to the lump of gold and stole it. the beasts expressed their sorrow and came one by one to his den where the lion devoured them. he grasped as many as he could possibly hold but when he tried to pull out his hand he was prevented from doing so by the neck of the pitcher. the lion in love 
a lion demanded the daughter of a woodcutter in marriage. the next day when it came out of its hole for food he took up his axe but by swinging too hastily missed its head and cut off only the end of its tail. the wolf in sheeps clothing 
once upon a time a wolf resolved to disguise his appearance in order to secure food more easily. in the evening he was shut up by the shepherd in the fold the gate was closed and the entrance made thoroughly secure. harm seek harm find. the ass shortly afterwards fell down dead under his burden. when the frogs discovered his easy good nature they sent yet a third time to jupiter to beg him to choose for them still another king. his companions came in great numbers to inquire after his health and each one helped himself to a share of the food which had been placed for his use so that he died not from his sickness but from the failure of the means of living. he rose up and shook himself in great wrath and searched every corner of his den to find the mouse. the mischievous dog 
a dog used to run up quietly to the heels of everyone he met and to bite them without notice. his master suspended a bell about his neck so that the dog might give notice of his presence wherever he went. the fox who had lost his tail 
a fox caught in a trap escaped but in so doing lost his tail. one of them was young and the other well advanced in years. thus it came to pass that between them both he very soon found that he had not a hair left on his head. those who seek to please everybody please nobody. they always bark whenever we approach you and attack us before we have done any harm. the old woman when she recovered her sight and saw none of her goods in her house would give him nothing. the physician insisted on his claim and as she still refused summoned her before the judge. one at last put the other to flight. pride goes before destruction. is there no young grass left when they had done this they found that they had only prepared for themselves greater troubles for their mistress no longer hearing the hour from the cock woke them up to their work in the middle of the night. the wolf however did truly come at last. the mother coming up and missing one of her sons inquired of his brothers what had become of him. after a time he went to the daughter who had married the gardener and inquired how she was and how all things went with her. at last he was caught in the very act and having his hands bound behind him was led away to the place of public execution. the frog one day intent on mischief bound the foot of the mouse tightly to his own. thus joined together the frog first of all led his friend the mouse to the meadow where they were accustomed to find their food. being in want of food he called to a sheep who was passing and asked him to fetch some water from a stream flowing close beside him. the huntsman and the fisherman 
a huntsman returning with his dogs from the field fell in by chance with a fisherman who was bringing home a basket well laden with fish. they quickly agreed to exchange the produce of their days sport. each was so well pleased with his bargain that they made for some time the same exchange day after day. the fox and the crow 
a crow having stolen a bit of meat perched in a tree and held it in her beak. there is not half enough straw for them to lie on. he at once consented. the widow and the sheep 
a certain poor widow had one solitary sheep. the lion agreed to assist the wild ass with his strength while the wild ass gave the lion the benefit of his greater speed. the eagle gave one look at the arrow that had entered his heart and saw in that single glance that its feathers had been furnished by himself. my son which of the gods do you think will pity you he had run no long distance when the lion turning about seized him and tore him to pieces. false confidence often leads into danger. the more honor the more danger. jupiter delighted with the offering of honey promised to give whatever she should ask. what shall i do to you the quarrel proceeded from words to blows and while the men fought the ass galloped off. i am not yet come to my full size. pray spare my life and put me back into the sea. the farmer wishing to catch him shut the gate. when the lion found that he could not escape he flew upon the sheep and killed them and then attacked the oxen. the farmer beginning to be alarmed for his own safety opened the gate and released the lion. he fed the one for his table and kept the other for the sake of its song. when the time came for killing the goose the cook went to get him at night when it was dark and he was not able to distinguish one bird from the other. by mistake he caught the swan instead of the goose. the woodcutter advised him to take shelter in his own hut so the fox crept in and hid himself in a corner. he declared that he had not seen him and yet pointed all the time he was speaking to the hut where the fox lay hidden. the huntsman took no notice of the signs but believing his word hastened forward in the chase. you are a capital bird at telling the time of day. when the pool dried up under the summers heat they left it and set out together for another home. fearing for their lives the mice kept themselves close in their holes. the lion concealed himself on seeing her approach but when she was safe within the cave sprang upon her and tore her to pieces. but the mouse reached his hole in safety. the bull rising up and not knowing what to do was sadly perplexed. when the peasant rose in pursuit the eagle let the bundle fall again. i have no fear of you but of the lion. the lion bursting out into a great rage devoured the ass. the ass and the frogs 
an ass carrying a load of wood passed through a pond. the trees and the axe 
a man came into a forest and asked the trees to provide him a handle for his axe. a fox came across him and being very hungry ate him up. the woman and her hen 
a woman possessed a hen that gave her an egg every day. the ass and the old shepherd 
a shepherd watching his ass feeding in a meadow was alarmed all of a sudden by the cries of the enemy. the camel 
when man first saw the camel he was so frightened at his vast size that he ran away. if you are a friend why do you bite me so hard a young calf came up and offered to go before and show him the way by which he could manage to pass. when he had waited some days in vain he saw the innkeeper dressed in a new and handsome coat and sitting before his door. the thief sat down beside him and talked with him. the innkeeper hearing his tale and believing what he said became greatly alarmed and rising from his seat attempted to run away. the innkeeper frightened lest he should be attacked left his new coat in the thiefs hand and ran as fast as he could into the inn for safety. the thief made off with the coat and did not return again to the inn. every tale is not to be believed. when he reached it he discovered to his grief that it contained so little water that he could not possibly get at it. he tried everything he could think of to reach the water but all his efforts were in vain. at last he collected as many stones as he could carry and dropped them one by one with his beak into the pitcher until he brought the water within his reach and thus saved his life. the two frogs 
two frogs were neighbors. the other refused saying that he felt it so very hard to leave a place to which he had become accustomed. the latter replied that he was and that he was descended from one of the most noble families in that city. supposing that a man was meant the monkey answered that he knew him very well and that he was an intimate friend. the horse and the stag 
at one time the horse had the plain entirely to himself. the horse consented and allowed the man to mount him. the kid and the wolf 
a kid returning without protection from the pasture was pursued by a wolf. he sighed heavily and hastened away as fast as he could run. you fellow there he received them kindly lighted a fire and warmed them. the wolf now that he had the opportunity fell upon the sheep and destroyed the greater part of the flock. the fox and the lion 
when a fox who had never yet seen a lion fell in with him by chance for the first time in the forest he was so frightened that he nearly died with fear. on meeting him for the second time he was still much alarmed but not to the same extent as at first. he therefore rolled himself in flour and lay down in a dark corner. a mouse supposing him to be food leaped upon him and was instantly caught and squeezed to death. another perished in a similar manner and then a third and still others after them. the ass and the wolf 
an ass feeding in a meadow saw a wolf approaching to seize him and immediately pretended to be lame. wishing to find out if she had the same effect on the persons in her fathers house he made some excuse to send her home on a visit to her father. the cock flying up perched himself on the branches of a tree while the dog found a bed beneath in the hollow trunk. a fox heard the sound and wishing to make a breakfast on him came and stood under the branches saying how earnestly he desired to make the acquaintance of the owner of so magnificent a voice. why do you not go faster union is strength. the ass being heavily laden moved slowly out of the way. the dogs and the fox 
some dogs finding the skin of a lion began to tear it in pieces with their teeth. while they were playing one day as children they happened by chance to look together into a mirror that was placed on their mothers chair. into reflection on herself. the sun suddenly shone out with all his warmth. the two men who were enemies 
two men deadly enemies to each other were sailing in the same vessel. all the beasts came to visit their king except the fox. the wolf therefore thinking that he had a capital opportunity accused the fox to the lion of not paying any respect to him who had the rule over them all and of not coming to visit him. at that very moment the fox came in and heard these last words of the wolf. however when the summer returned again he lay asleep stretched at his full length and appeared to himself to be of a great size. he supposed that summer had come and went and sold his cloak. what have you done i have not slain a single man of your troop. mercury appeared and demanded the cause of his tears. after he told him his misfortune mercury plunged into the stream and bringing up a golden axe inquired if that were the one he had lost. one of them at once resolved to try and secure the same good fortune for himself. he ran to the river and threw his axe on purpose into the pool at the same place and sat down on the bank to weep. mercury appeared to him just as he hoped he would and having learned the cause of his grief plunged into the stream and brought up a golden axe inquiring if he had lost it. the shepherd seeing what had happened ran up and caught him. the eagle and the fox 
an eagle and a fox formed an intimate friendship and decided to live near each other. the man raised one of the dishes a little towards his mouth and blew in it. seeing his own shadow reflected in the water he greatly admired the size and variety of his horns but felt angry with himself for having such slender and weak feet. how i have deceived myself the shepherd again consented. the owl came forth from her hollow seized her and put her to death. the monkey and the camel 
the beasts of the forest gave a splendid entertainment at which the monkey stood up and danced. he resolved to cut it down and taking his axe in his hand made a bold stroke at its roots. he paid no attention to their request but gave the tree a second and a third blow with his axe. the two soldiers and the robber 
two soldiers traveling together were set upon by a robber. he found a serpent in the upper branches of the tree and again being greatly alarmed he threw himself into the river where a crocodile caught him and ate him. thus the earth the air and the water alike refused shelter to a murderer. the fox discovered and pointed out the prey the lion sprang on it and seized it. the fox soon became jealous of the lion carrying off the lions share and said that he would no longer find out the prey but would capture it on his own account. the serpent turning about bit the crow with a mortal wound. a violent fever suddenly set in from which he died not many days later. we had better bear our troubles bravely than try to escape them. the cat and venus 
a cat fell in love with a handsome young man and entreated venus to change her into the form of a woman. venus was much disappointed and again caused her to return to her former shape. they had not gone far when they met with a troop of women collected round a well talking and laughing. what respect is shown to old age in these days do you see that idle lad riding while his old father has to walk they had now almost reached the town. a lion met him in the path and seizing the lamb took it from him. the ant climbed onto it and floated in safety to the bank. i do not often get such a chance as this. as these thoughts passed through his mind he met an elephant and came close to hold a conversation with him. his companion followed with quiet and easy step. at night they returned home not dreaming of any danger but supposing that on the morrow they would find him dead. but when war broke out a heavily armed soldier mounted the horse and riding him to the charge rushed into the very midst of the enemy. my father and the cat became good friends but my fathers mother was very upset about the cat. together they went for a walk in the park and tried to think of nice things to talk about. asked the cat. as you can see im an old cat now but in my younger days i was quite a traveler. well it just so happened that i missed the boat and while waiting for the next i thought id look around a bit. now the animals there are very lazy and they used to hate having to go all the way around the beginning of this river to get to the other side of the island. asked my father who thought the cat was taking an awfully long time to explain. they tied a big rope around his neck and waited for the wing to get well. hes not a very big dragon about the size of a large black bear although i imagine hes grown quite a bit since i left. said my father. hes always tied to a stake on a rope just long enough to go across the river. really hes the most miserable animal ive ever come across. now im quite sure that if you were able to rescue the dragon which wouldnt be the least bit easy hed let you ride him most anywhere provided you were nice to him of course. of course she was too old to go along. everything had to be kept very secret so when they found or bought anything to take on the trip they hid it behind a rock in the park. the night before my father sailed he borrowed his fathers knapsack and he and the cat packed everything very carefully. he went down into the hold and hid among some bags of wheat. the ship sailed early the next morning. my father finds the island 
my father hid in the hold for six days and nights. he didnt look just exactly like the other bags but it was the best he could do. they lowered a big net into the hold and began moving the bags of wheat. the other sailors looked at the bag too and my father who was in the bag of course tried even harder to look like a bag of wheat. then another sailor felt the bag and he just happened to get hold of my fathers elbow. they left the piece of paper for the merchant and sailed away that evening. he never found it because as soon as it was dark my father climbed out of the bag folded it up and put it back in his knapsack. my father was very hungry when he woke up the next morning. just as he was looking to see if he had anything left to eat something hit him on the head. he walked and walked and walked along the shore looking for the rocks that joined the two islands. he walked all day and once when he met a fisherman and asked him about wild island the fisherman began to shake and couldnt talk for a long while. it scared him that much just thinking about it. this didnt bother my father. he kept walking and slept on the beach again that night. it was a very black night and my father could hardly see the rocks ahead of him. sometimes the rocks were far apart and my father had to get a running start and leap from one to the next. it grew louder and louder as he got nearer to the island. at last it seemed as if he was right on top of the noise and he was. and it never knew my father had jumped on its back by mistake. for seven hours my father climbed and slipped and leapt from rock to rock but while it was still dark he finally reached the very last rock and stepped off onto wild island. the first thing to do he decided was to find the river because the dragon was tied somewhere along its bank. so my father walked until the sun rose and he was quite far from the ocean rocks. my father saw a tiny paw rubbing itself on his knapsack. my father waited a few minutes and then started down the beach because it was almost dark now and he was afraid the mouse really would tell somebody. he had his knapsack on his back. asked the voice. my father didnt know what to say because what would a monkey have on its back and how would it sound telling someone about it if it did have something he walked all night and toward morning came to the river. then his troubles really began. my father hated to leave the beach but he decided to start along the river bank where at least the jungle wasnt quite so thick. here the jungle was so thick that he could hardly see where the river was. it was very hard to walk in the jungle. once or twice he thought he heard something laughing at him. at last he came out into a clearing and ran right into the middle of it so that he could see anything that might try to attack him. was he surprised when he looked and saw fourteen green eyes coming out of the jungle all around the clearing and when the green eyes turned into seven tigers then the next tiger spoke. said the third tiger. my father thought of the cat and knew this wasnt true. but of course he had too much sense to say so. the tigers went on talking in turn. said the seventh tiger. and they moved in closer. my father looked at those seven hungry tigers and then he had an idea. and they moved so close that he could feel them breathing on his face. all sorts of animals might be using it too but he decided to follow the trail no matter what he met because it might lead to the dragon. but monkeys grandmother died a week ago so they must have seen something else. soon the trail crossed a little brook and my father who by this time was very thirsty stopped to get a drink of water. said a deep angry voice. with that the animal tossed my father up and down over the water. asked my father trying to get his breath and he thought over all the things he had in his pack. but why should i be telling you these things i can hardly believe it dont like it one bit not one bit wont you ever learn the lion yelled at my father. said the lion. and he picked up my father in his front paws to feel how fat he was. said the lion. my father opened the pack and took out the comb and the brush and the seven hair ribbons of different colors. as my father was doing this the lion watched very carefully and began to look much happier. when my father tied on the ribbon he was all smiles. said the lion. as a matter of fact he was so busy that he didnt even know when my father left. he wanted to eat eight or ten but he had only thirteen left and it might be a long time before he could get more. said the other boar now very close to my father. it was the lions mother of course and that thought my father must mean that the dragon was on this side of the river. he hurried on but it was farther away than he had judged. he finally came to the river bank in the late afternoon and looked all around but there was no dragon anywhere in sight. he must have gone back to the other side. said a huge voice. said the six little monkeys. my father makes a bridge 
my father walked back and forth along the bank trying to think of some way to cross the river. what a life for a baby dragon the pole was very high and even if he could get to the top without being seen hed have to go all the way across hand over hand. he looked all around in the water but it was dusk now and he couldnt see anything there. a pale moon came out from behind the clouds and my father could see where the voice was coming from. the crocodiles head was just peeping out of the water. said the crocodile. the crocodile who had first spoken swam up and tasted it. he said. asked my father. its a trick kill it its over there now see my father didnt have a moment to spare. by now the dragon realized that my father was coming to rescue him. im right here can you see me theyre all coming over well make it. he looked around and saw something which surprised and delighted him. all the rest did the same thing one right after the other until they were all swimming away in a line. my father and the dragon laughed themselves weak because it was such a silly sight. he was the most excited baby dragon that ever lived. said the dragon. but my father and the dragon knew that nothing in the world would ever make them go back to wild island. the end 

the peace egg and other tales. a christmas tale. every one ought to be happy at christmas. the captain and his wife were sad though it was christmas eve. the captains wife. happy though she had no mother. it was when she married the captain. at last he gave her her choice between the captain and his own favour and money. it stands to reason military men arent domestic and i wish lucy jane fetch your papas slippers quick if the life was rough the captain was ready. but it was not so with the captains wife. and yet as years went and children came the captain and his wife grew tired of travelling. at last they were sent home. she never knew it for when he saw that she had given her heart to his younger rival he kept silence and he never asked for what he knew he might have had the old mans authority in his favour. master robert. the eldest of the captains children was a boy. asked the captain. asked the captain with a look of anger and also of surprise. says he. says i. im not going round the guards says he i promised not. with this sarah had to content herself and she went back to the nursery. said the captain. and on duty poor robert had to remain for the captain had a will as well as his son. the next night he was very glad to go quietly to bed and remain there. in the nursery. the captains children sat at breakfast in a large bright nursery. this was just what he would have wished. roberts tongue was seldom idle even at meals. he asked pausing with his spoon full in his hand. i cant very often but mamma can and can speak it too. papa says mamma always talks yorkshire to servants and poor people. sarah knew who the old gentleman was and knew also that the children did not know and that their parents did not see fit to tell them as yet. but she had a passion for telling and hearing news and would rather gossip with a child than not gossip at all. ive done mine. for what we have received the lord make us truly thankful. say your grace and put your chair away and come along. and seizing his own chair by the seat robin carried it swiftly to its corner. shouted robin. to keep a secret was beyond sarahs powers. robin sighed. said he. said robin impatiently. he suggested. not being at all shy he joined them and asked so many questions that he soon got to know all about it. said robin. cried robin. he was resolved to have a nursery performance and to act the part of st. george himself. the others were willing for what he wished but there were difficulties. in the first place there are eight characters in the play and there were only five children. mamma had her reasons and these were always good. she had not been altogether pleased that robin had bought the play. if mamma thought the parts not quite fit for the children to learn they found them much too long so in the end she picked out some bits for each which they learned easily and which with a good deal of fighting made quite as good a story of it as if they had done the whole. what may have been wanting otherwise was made up for by the dresses which were charming. cried robin in dismay. christmas eve. robin thought that christmas would never come. to the captain and his wife it seemed to come too fast. christmas eve came. the performance was most successful. said st. george abruptly dropping his sword and running up to her. robin seized the other hand and kissed it tenderly. he was very fond of his mother. it made everybody laugh. they dont want us i know. he inquired. it was a very fine night. i dont like these sticks. there was a pause. it might have been a prison. said the woman. repeated the woman. the boy is right. at last he remembered. it was the old gentleman of the blue cloak. no. the old man was seated in a carved oak chair by the fire. he had seen robins name. he asked in a hoarse voice. she didnt exactly send us but i dont think shell mind our having come if we get back in time for supper. as the children acted the old mans anger wore off. asked the old man in a strange sharp tone. there the old man was startled and lifted his face suddenly. it was wet with tears. exclaimed the children with one breath. and papa said we must all be very good and kind to poor dear mamma and so i mean to be shes so good. asked the old man. asked the grandfather. said the old man. the old man asked. the children had not been missed. but it was her father with her child in his arms the bulls had just taken their seats when the captains wife came in. there was now no doubt about the matter. then the captain bowed and passed in and the old man followed him. this was a proper christmas indeed they said. there was a general rejoicing. the swords are of steel and those i have seen are short. it is not easy to explain in writing even so much of it as i know. are in double time twice as quick as the others. he falls and st. george calls for the doctor in the usual words. but it seems at one time to have been made of milk. enter fool. fool. good morrow friends and neighbours dear     we are right glad to meet you here     christmas comes but once a year     but when it comes it brings good cheer     and when its gone its no longer near.

the one who has just spoken should cross before the one who is going to speak. learn to stand still. as a rule do not speak when you are crossing the stage but cross first and then speak. it is easy to drop them into the basket again. iii. a very important part of your preparations will be the dresses. who go about the london streets with one board in front and one behind. they need come no higher than the chin if a good thick bush is firmly held by the little hands behind so as to conceal the face. i hope you will not fight for them it is said to be a mistake to wash them off. i can only say that we found them answer. a tale of christmas eve. mr. and mrs. skratdj. once upon a time there lived a certain family of the name of skratdj. it began with the father and mother. they were a worthy couple and really attached to each other. indeed as may be gathered from this conversation mrs. skratdj was quite able to defend herself. but in the course of fifteen years she had learned that mr. skratdjs bark was a great deal worse than his bite. if indeed he had a bite at all. those who were at a distance did not mind so much. the married ones had more idea of how it really was and wished in the name of common sense and good taste that skratdj and his wife would not make fools of themselves. also that it is a kindness and almost a duty to let people think and say and do things in their own way occasionally. it began at breakfast if not sooner. papa but mr. skratdj would not always listen even to harry. now ill go and tell papa. but when he reached the landing he paused. so harry went. i see you. youre stopping. as he turned the handle of the door mr. skratdj turned round. pollys expedition met with the same fate and she attempted to cover her retreat in a similar manner. meanwhile mr. skratdj scolded mrs. skratdj for not keeping the children in better order. thats a different thing said polly. said polly. youll try to get one i know. and he never barked at that gentleman again. and neither mr. nor mrs. skratdj could help laughing. he was very fond of children and a good friend to them. harry broke in. and harry came up to him. cried both the children. just as he crossed the threshold he turned back and put his head into the room. he asked. cried the children with alarm. with which he departed gravely shaking his head. in the afternoon the children attacked him again. but never mind that now please. tell us about our tongues. nothing half so pleasant christmas eve. the evening was very lively. st at it said harry. it would be better if it were quite out. now come. said harry. dancing with the dragons. said harry. but when he opened them again what a sight he saw and the room was full of these dragons. how they leaped about they were for ever leaping over each other like seals at play. cried harry. harry asked. the game is this. you have always to be jumping over somebody else and you must either talk or bark. if anybody speaks to you you must snap in return. you know. i mean men and women and children. said the dragon. cried harry. we have glorious fun in the mountain sometimes. oh delicious but this is only at times. we had a charming meeting last year. so many human beings and how they can snap it was a choice party. said harry. here they are however. off with you he shuddered as he looked at his companions. said one of the blue dragons. snapped harry. asked another dragon leaping over harry. how long the dreadful game went on harry never exactly knew. thought poor harry. at last there was only one. screamed harry in despair. but that leap was his last. and harry was left on his face on the floor in the darkness. conclusion. when his friends found him there was blood on his forehead. said he driving his hands through his hair. i dont know if they heard the story. i fear mr. and mrs. skratdj have yet got to dance with the dragons. old father christmas. old father christmas. and young people did not get presents when i was a child as they get them now. we had not half so many toys as you have but we kept them twice as long.  carrying the royal arms and bound to go rough weather and fair. manys the time ive done it in play you understand with that whip and those gloves. dear dear it had this remarkable property when you put it to your ear you could hear the roaring of the sea. its the very moral she was very industrious. i added      the hat cloak and boots in the finished drawing. no. no. no. the face from      giant despair. no. no. no. we loved each other dearly. i can remember when they were first introduced into england and what wonderful things we thought them. i asked. we went into the kitchen but even here was no place of rest for us. the cat was enough for her temper she added. we put kittys shawl over our two heads and went outside. i rather hoped to see something of dick for it was holiday time but no dick passed. we ran across the little yard and looked over the wall at the end to see if we could see anything or anybody. the white fields looked vast and dreary in the dusk. an old man was coming along the lane. he had a face like the sort of apple that keeps well in winter his coat was old and brown. at likely intervals. thatll be a fine sight im only going up yonder. this puzzled us. said my father. but he passed on before i could explain that we had seen father christmas himself and had had his word for it that he would return at four oclock and that the candles on his tree would be lighted as soon as it was dark. what did we care what our mother was doing in the parlour we who had seen old father christmas himself and were expecting him back again every moment two three four we ran to our old place and peeped but could see nothing. i said to the dog. said the dog. i think hes dead she sobbed. ill fetch father. kitty was as strong as a man and they carried father christmas between them into the kitchen. i think we were taught more honest shame about certain things than i often see in little boys and girls now. he has his word in everything and is not a bit shy and his papa never comes home from town but harry runs to ask him if hes brought him a present. papa says hell be the ruin of him i said grace during which he stood and indeed he stood for some time afterwards with his eyes shut i fancy under the impression that i was still speaking. oh how kind of you which i think must have bewildered him but he only smiled and nodded. come kitty. but the picture was nothing to the reality. she went back to her oven before the lights were out and the angel on the top of the tree taken down. our presents certainly did not last so long when he was buried his little dog came to us. i suppose he remembered the hospitality he had received. puss always looked on him with favour. but he never did. the end. he knew all about the world and the people in it. he was deeply religious and every indian child loved him for his goodness and brave deeds. he made this world and all that is on it. he came out of the south and travelled toward the north making the birds and animals as he passed. oldman used to live on this world with the animals and birds. he lived with the wolves for they are the great hunters. even today we make the same sign for a smart man as we make for the wolf so you see he taught them much while he lived with them. but he often made great mischief and taught many wicked things. these i shall tell you about some day. it was a fine summer day and oldman was travelling in the forest. he was going north and straight as an arrow looking at nothing hearing nothing. no one knows what he was after to this day. who is this person tell me his name but the man didnt answer he was dead. when oldman saw that life had left the wounded man he drank from the spring and went on toward the north but before long he heard a noise as of men fighting and he stopped to look and listen. the person was full of arrows and he was pulling them from his ugly body. tell me so i can make you a fine present for you are great in war. it is always the same they are frightened and i kill them easily. when you are big as you now are it is very hard to make a living but when you are small little food will make you fat. your living will be easy because i will make your food grow everywhere. all of your children and their children must wear them too. he didnt like the looks of it. they came as soon as they received the message for they were afraid of oldman and always tried to please him. i want it to be that way to save me work. again he showed them his robe that they might see just what he wanted. now go away and remember what i have said lest i make you sick. how the ducks got their fine feathers 
another night had come and i made my way toward war eagles lodge. you have noticed that they wear fine clothes but you do not know how they got them so i will tell you tonight. on the hill where oldman stood there was a great deal of moss and he began to tear it from the ground and roll it into a great ball. he called i have a big load here and i am going to give you people a dance. come and help me get things ready. come into the lodge but they wouldnt do that. the gray goose too was careful to stay close to the door but the ducks reached all about the fire. besides that i want a brown breast and yellow legs but i dont want my wife painted that way. oldman painted them all just as they wanted him to and kept singing all the time. ho ho you can see that the colors oldman painted so long ago are still bright and handsome and they will stay that way forever and forever. greeted war eagle making the sign for me to be seated near him as i entered his lodge. that same laugh nearly cost him his life once as you will see. the snow covered the land and ice was on all of the rivers. it was so cold that oldman wrapped his robe close about himself and his breath showed white in the air. of course the wolf was not cold wolves never get cold as men do. both oldman and the wolf were hungry for they had travelled far and had killed no meat. no he was afraid to be left alone and hungry in the snow that was all. said the wolf i am swift of foot and my teeth are white and sharp. what chance has an otter against me yes i will go and he did. nearer and nearer ran the wolf. in fact he was just about to seize an otter when splash ho that was their country and they were running to reach that same hole all the time but the wolf didnt know that. ho but he made a great fuss. but he was angry. your feathers are standing up on the top of your head now and they will stay that way too. somehow the music made me sad and not until it had ceased did we enter. he often got into trouble but something always happened to get him out of it. what i shall tell you now will show you that it is not well to try to do things just because others do them. they may be right for others and wrong for us but oldman didnt understand that you see. and all the mice would run past the big rock. back they would come right under the dangerous rock. i want to play that game. no you will shake the ground. you are too heavy and the rock may fall and kill you. my people are light of foot and fast. we are having a good time but if you should try to do as we are doing you might get hurt and that would spoil our fun. came the great rock on top of oldman and held him fast in the mud. my how he screamed and called for aid. he was angry and was saying things people should not say for they do no good and make the mind wicked. quit kicking about so. how can i see with my eyes full of mud tell me that. i am going to try to help you out of your trouble. oldman lost his temper altogether you see which is a bad thing to do for we lose our friends with it often. temper is like a bad dog about a lodge no friends will come to see us when he is about. i guess i am too small and weak. i shall come back to you. i will also tell you how he made the first man and the first woman and who they were. but now the grouse is fast asleep nobody is stirring but those who were made to see in the dark like the owl and the wolf. he made them and therefore knew just what each would have to understand in order to make his living. they have never forgotten anything he told them even to this day. all were busy working and making a living when one day it commenced to rain. that was nothing of course but it didnt stop as it had always done before. it crept into the lodge of the wolf at night and frightened his wife and children. it poured into the den of the bear among the rocks and he had to move. it was bad very bad indeed. all about oldmans fire they sat and whispered or talked in signs. then the rest knew he had made up his mind and knew what he would do. it was a monstrous raft that oldman had built as he sang his song in the darkness. everybody hurry and sit on this raft i have made and they did hurry. that was when the great logs began to tremble as the water lifted them from the ground. then the world was no more for the water had whipped the land in the war it made against it. night returned and yet the rain came down. it was bad and they were all afraid even oldman himself was scared. all was water. the water was the world. he knew that something must be done but he didnt know what. tell him i want him. i made you that way and i know. said oldman. i gave you life and if you lose it this way i will return it to you. you shall live again all waited and watched and longed for good luck but when he came to the top he was dead. asked oldman while everybody crowded as close as he could. things were bad and getting worse. everybody was cross and all wondered what oldman would do next when somebody laughed. but he paid no attention to oldman or the rest and slipped from the raft to the water. his tail cut the water like a knife and he was gone. finally it was dry then he settled the hand that held the dirt in the water slowly until the water touched the dirt. hard he blew and waved his hands and the dirt began to grow in size right before their eyes. oldman kept blowing and waving his hands until the dirt became real land and the trees began to grow. so large it grew that none could see across it. then he stopped his blowing and sang some more. run around this land i have made that i may know how large it is. he was very poor from much running too but oldman said the world wasnt big enough yet so he blew some more and again sent the wolf out to run around the land. he never came back no the oldman had made it so big that the wolf died of old age before he got back to the raft. then all the people went out upon the land to make their living and they were happy there too. then he set them side by side and breathed upon them. they lived and he made them very strong and healthy very beautiful to look upon. your grandfather will tell you why if you ask him. on the way he told me what his grandmother had said and that he intended to ask for the reason as soon as we arrived. yes they are great people as you will see. almost every night they would have a council and quarrel over it. some said the greatest thief should be chosen. i forget who told him but i think it was the rabbit. it took until almost daylight too. he listened to it all every bit. and they did stop. you all see this bone in my right hand dont you finally he stopped singing and held out his hands both shut tight and both with their backs up. he asked them. oldman asked the bear to name the hand that held the bone and the bear did but when oldman opened that hand it was empty the bone was not there. then everybody laughed at the bear. oldman smiled a little and began to sing and again pass the bone. i saw you put it there. whoever that is he shall be chief under me forever. the buffalo tried hard for he didnt want the mouse to be chief but it didnt do him any good for the mouse won in the end. i am too small to be your chief and i know it. i want to live in peace with my wife and family. i know nothing of war. i get my living easily. i dont like to have enemies. i am going to give my right to be chief to the man that oldman has made like himself. that made the man chief forever and that is why he is greater than the animals and the birds. there is where they have lived and brought up their families ever since the night the mouse beat the buffalo playing the bone game. then he sang just as oldman did so long ago. you have noticed that our warriors wear it sometimes and you know that we all think it very lucky to wear the skin of the otter. but you dont know how it came to be great so i shall tell you. no woman wanted to marry him because he couldnt kill enough meat to keep her in food and clothes. whenever he went hunting his bow always broke or he would lose his lance. if these things didnt happen his horse would fall and hurt him. he tried to dream and get his medicine but no dream would come. he grew sour and people were sorry for him all the time. he used to wander about alone a good deal and one morning he saw an old woman gathering wood by the side of a river. why is that sorry look in your fine eyes everything goes wrong with me always. i dont want to live any longer for my heart is growing wicked. first you must learn a song to sing and this is it. when you get to the place you must stand still for a long time and then sing the song i taught you. he is wise and can tell you what to do to change your luck. now go and be brave long his steps were for he was young and strong. his feet grew tired for he travelled day and night without resting but his heart was brave and he believed what the old woman had told him. all about the ground was neat and clean and bare as your hand. what do you want of me i have never heard a man sing that song before. you must be in trouble. i can do nothing well. i can find no woman who will marry me. in the hunt my bow will often break or my lance is poor. my medicine is bad and i cannot dream. the people do not love me and they pity me as they do a sick child. that is all i can do for you myself. why do you sing that song i never heard a man sing it before. what is it you want of me long they travelled without stopping over plains and mountains through great forests and across rivers until they came to a cave in the rough rocks on the side of a mighty mountain. finally he saw a fire away back in the cave. but looking he saw a man sitting on the far side of the fire. the mans hair was like the snow and very long. why did you come here what is it you want this owl is the only one who knows how you can change your luck and he will tell you if you are not afraid. take this arrow and go among those people without fear. now go in the centre of the circle there sat a mighty owl their chief. ho i am not afraid of you. sit down my son and tell me what you want. why do you come here you must be in trouble. you must smoke with me. take this bow. now go down this mountain until you come to a river. it will be dark when you reach this river but you will know the way. shoot quickly for if you do not you can never have any good luck. it will make anybody lucky and you may tell your people that it is so. all the day he travelled and far into the night. he stood and looked and listened but for a long time could see nothing hear nothing. that night he dreamed and all was well with him. he became a great hunter and a great chief among us. he married the most beautiful woman in the tribe and was good to her always. they had many children and we remember his name as one that was great in war. then war eagle lighted the pipe passing it to the distinguished friend who in turn passed it to me after first offering it to the sun the father and the earth the mother of all that is. to do so would insult the host and bring bad luck to all who assembled. such beautiful work had never been seen before. that thief and rascal was oldman and of course the sun knew all about him. no man knows in what country it is. he was close to the lodge when the moon came out and there he waited until the sun went inside. then he waited a while before creeping closer. little by little the old rascal crawled toward the lodge till finally his head was inside the door. then he ran away as fast as he could go. he said to himself i am far enough now and i shall sleep. bad deeds bring bad dreams to us all. oldman sat up and there was the sun looking right in his face and laughing. here he stopped and looked about for he was afraid the sun would hear his heart beating. he listened a long time before he dared to go to sleep but finally he did. my dont you know that the whole world is my lodge and that you can never get outside of it if you run your foolish legs off dont you know that i light all of my lodge every day and search it carefully dont you know that nothing can hide from me and live i shall not harm you this time but i warn you now that if you ever steal from me again i will hurt you badly. now go and dont let me catch you stealing again that is all. i am inclined to believe that the winds are made in that pass myself for there they are seldom at rest especially at this season of the year. it was a fine one and painted with strange signs. without calling or speaking he entered the lodge and saw a man sitting by the fire smoking his pipe. the man didnt speak nor did he offer his pipe to oldman as our people do when they are glad to see visitors. he didnt even look at his guest but oldman has no good manners at all. he couldnt see that he wasnt wanted as he looked about the mans lodge and made himself at home. the lodge was clean and the fire was bright but there was no woman about. then he saw a woman way up in a tree top and right over the lodge. she looked young and beautiful and tall. asked oldman. she screamed but he caught her and held her although she scratched him badly. the man married them and they were happy for four days but on the fifth morning oldman was gone gone with all the dried meat in the lodge the thief. he got his bow and arrows and left the lodge in anger. there was snow on the ground and the man took the track of oldman intending to catch and kill him. he saw the man coming fast. then he will pass me and i can go where i please. go quickly for he is close upon us. his eyes were red and his legs were trembling. right over his head he saw the black bird and knew him too. you think you will escape me do you well you will not for i too know magic and am wise. then he stood within the ring and sang a song. the eagle saw the change and at once began turning over and over in the air. this frightened her and she ran inside the lodge where the fire kept the shadows from coming. he has done wrong. like an arrow i travel straight and fast. he crawled out of the lodge. into the shadows he ran away away into the night and the darkness away from himself whenever that voice says a thing is wicked it is wicked no matter who says it is not. yes it is very hard for a man to hide from himself. they hid themselves in some brush which grew beside an old game trail that followed the river and there waited for a chance deer. went a dry stick. on he came nearly to the brush that hid the hunters when throwing his beautiful head high in the air he stopped turning his side a trifle. out from the cover came the hunters and with ready bow they followed along the trail. yes there was blood on a log and more on the dead leaves. it was their first deer and pride shone in their faces as they told their grandfather that night in the lodge. tonight i shall tell you what happened to oldman when he did that. yes and he got into trouble over it. he was hungry and began to think of some way to kill one of the bulls for meat. very soon he thought out a plan for he is cunning always. then he set them in the position of fighting made them look as though they were about to fight each other with the knives. brothers wait for me do not run away. they will surely fight unless we stop them. it all started over you two bulls too. dont let our brothers fight over such a foolish thing as that. it would be wicked. now i can decide it if you will let me feel all over you to see if you are fat or poor. then i will go back to the men and settle the trouble by telling them the truth. stand still and let me feel your sides quick lest the fight begin while i am away. then oldman walked up close and commenced to feel about the bulls sides but his heart was bad. it gained upon the left hand rapidly and this made the left hand angry. that is the very worst thing you can call a person in our language you know and of course it made the right hand angry. all this fighting hurt oldman badly of course and he commenced to cry as women do sometimes. if you want meat you go and kill it as i did. ha ha foolish oldman ha ha told them that his own hands couldnt get along with themselves and that it would be easy to steal it from him. do not lie do not quarrel. it is bad. the camp was to move. not a cloud was in the sky and the wind was still. so the day wore on the scene constantly changing as we travelled. as soon as supper was over i found the children and together we sought war eagles lodge. my grandfather told me about it when i was young. of course there is a reason for it. he talked pleasantly with the trees and his heart grew tender. that is he had good thoughts and of course they made him happy. you may have my robe. i have hundreds of robes in my camp and i dont need this one at all. that was a lie he told about having so many robes. all he had was the one he wore. soon it began to snow then the wind blew from the north with a good strength behind it. that stone never did anything for me anyhow. nobody is ever good to a stone. ill just go back and get my robe. then he pulled the robe away and wrapped it about himself. ho but that made the stone angry ho oldman started to run down the hill and the stone ran after him. ho now i will teach you to give presents and then take them away and the stone rolled right on top of oldman and sat on his back. he tried to throw off the stone but failed. help help and broke it in two pieces. indeed he did. but he broke the rock and oldman stood upon his feet. i am going to make you different from other birds make you so people will always notice you. the crows have only borrowed those horses and will pay for their use with others of their own. i shall also tell you why that persons nose is black because it is part of the story. i am sure you didnt guess that. he was always a great thief like oldman but once he went too far as you shall see. i guess i will go and find out. when he got quite near where the fire was he stopped and listened. he heard some loud laughing but could not see who it was that felt so glad and gay. they were running and laughing and having a big time too. what do you think they were doing they were running about the fire all chasing one squirrel. as soon as the squirrel was caught they would bury him in the ashes near the fire until he cried then they would dig him out in a hurry. then another squirrel would take the lead and run until he was caught as the other had been. they never left the buried one in the ashes after he cried but always kept their promise and dug him out right away. asked oldman. lie down and oldman did lie down near the fire. then the squirrels began to laugh and bury oldman in the ashes as they did their own kind. you are burning me quick dig me out. all of you lie down at once in a row. then i will cover you all at one time. when you cry i will dig you out right away and the game will be over. every squirrel there was in the world was buried in the ashes except one woman squirrel and she told oldman she couldnt play and had to go home. if she hadnt gone there might not be any squirrels in this world right now. yes it is lucky that she went home. when he had finished making the plate he returned to the fire and it had burned low again. he looked behind him he looked about him but the plate was surely gone. ho but he was angry. he stamped about in the brush and called aloud to those who might hear him but nobody answered and then he started to look for the thief. oldman has sharp eyes and he found the trail in the grass where somebody had passed while he slept. at last he came to a place where the grass was all bent down and there he found his willow plate but it was empty. he hadnt intended to go to sleep but he crawled upon a big stone near the foot of a hill and sat down where he could see a long way. it wasnt much of a tail then but enough for oldman to hold to. ho you were full and i was hungry. i had to have something to eat had to get my living. please let me go and do not hurt me. ho ill teach you. ill fix you right now. steal from me will you your children shall all grow to look the same way just to pay you for your stealing from the man that made you. and they do too a cold rain was falling and the night comes early when the clouds hang low. the children loved a bright fire and tonight war eagles lodge was light as day. an indians pipe is large to look at but holds little tobacco. asked the old warrior. no wonder you are a great hunter. ho give them to me and i shall then be the great hunter and never be hungry. on and on oldman ran. faster and faster he flew through the country setting fire to the brush and grass as he passed. finally he came to a great river and jumped in. if we keep this always in mind we shall never get into trouble. never blame the wolf for what he does. he was made to do such things. tomorrow night i will tell you why there are so many snakes in the world. we stood and listened until the noise of the chase died away and then went into the lodge where we were greeted as usual by war eagle. he was pretty to look at and was painted with all the colors we know. this snake was proud of his clothes and had a wicked heart. most snakes are wicked because they are his relations. sometimes this is not so but that is part of another story. he was in love with her and she knew it but she paid no attention to him. this went on for a long time but she never talked to him at all. the snake thought maybe the hill wasnt high enough so he found a higher one and watched the moon pass from the top. he wondered what kept her so long and became suspicious of the snake. he made up his mind to watch and try to catch them together. so every morning the sun left the lodge a little earlier than before and one morning just as he climbed a mountain he saw the big snake talking to the moon. my the sun was angry the little pieces each turned into a little snake just as you see them now but they were all too small for the moon to notice after that. that is how so many snakes came into the world and that is why they are all small nowadays. nobody knows that until he is told and now i shall tell you so you will always know and tell your children that they too may know. all these things happened long ago when the world was young as you are now. why you cant run half as fast as i can but if you want to run a race let us bet something. what shall it be i cant run on flat ground. its too easy for me. another race with you on your own ground and i think i can beat you there too. let us run a race here. i dont want to waste my breath for nothing. are you all ready go stop you can beat me. i give up. if you will come tomorrow evening i will tell you of some trouble that oldman got into once. he deserved it for he was wicked as you shall see. if about to go to war the indian did not ask his god for aid oh no. he realized that god made his enemy too and that if he desired that enemys destruction it would be accomplished without mans aid. whenever the indian addressed the great god his prayer was for life and life alone. oldman was the one who started it and our people have followed his example ever since. ho oldman made a fool of himself that day. all of the bushes along the rivers were loaded with them and our people were about to gather what they needed when oldman changed things as far as the gathering was concerned. they look fine and i need them. besides some of the people will see them and get them if i dont. for a time oldman stood in the river and looked for the berries but they were gone. that is a funny thing. i wonder where they hid that time. i must have those berries he said to himself. he looked about him and the berries were gone again. he felt on the bottom of the river but they were not there. as soon as the water settled and became smooth there were the berries the same as before. ho oldman was wild he was angry i tell you. and in he went flat on his stomach i will stay right here and wait for those berries that is what i shall do and he did. and there right over the water he saw the same bunch of berries on some tall bushes. dont you see now he was ready for war. he climbed out on the bank again and cut a club. you shall be beaten every year as long as you live to pay for what you have done you and your children too. i have heard white men say that they had seen indians use them but i have never found an indian that ever used them himself or knew of their having been used by his people. oldman and his brother the red fox were travelling together for company. they were on a hillside when oldman said i am hungry. can you not kill a rabbit or something for us to eat the way is long and i am getting old you know. you are swift of foot and cunning and there are rabbits among these rocks. you are great and i have heard you can do most anything. i think you are the one to help not i. your weapons are ever with you your great nose and your sharp teeth. you were not looking but i saw them and if you will do as i want you to we shall have plenty of meat. this is my scheme i shall pull out all of your hair leaving your body white and smooth like that of the fish. i shall leave only the white hair that grows on the tip of your tail and that will make you funny to look at. that will make them laugh so hard that they will fall down and laugh on the ground. when they fall i shall come upon them with my knife and kill them. pull out my hair no i will not suffer you to pull my hair out when the winter is so near cried the fox. if you will do this we shall have meat for the winter and a fire to keep us warm. see the wind is in the south and warm. come let me do it replied oldman. now go and dance before the bulls and i shall watch and be ready for my part of the scheme. then he began to dance before them as oldman had told him. my louder and louder laughed the bulls until they fell to the ground with their breath short from the laughing. i am the real hunter. i depend on my head for meat ha in fact it was nearly night when he got the work all done. yes poor red fox stood there and spoke no word said nothing at all even when oldman had finished. whats the matter with you are you sorry that we have meat say answer me the fox had been caught by the north wind naked and was dead. oldman built a fire and warmed his hands that was all he cared for the red fox and that is all he cared for anybody. he might have known that no person could stand the north wind without a robe but as long as he was warm himself that was all he wanted. that was some of oldmans work too. and i dont blame him. the wind seemed to add to the good nature of our host as he filled and passed me the pipe. sometimes you know there are great winds in the summer too. then he went down to the river and found no relief. blow worse than ever you blew before and send this heat away from the world. it wouldnt break bend and break the wind tried to blow harder but it couldnt and that made the thing worse because oldman was so angry he went crazy. i tell you break i will bend but i shall never never break. that will do you good they do too. now you know. that day the children came to my camp and i told them several stories that appeal to white children. they were deeply interested and asked many questions. not until the hunters returned did my visitors leave. yes he made him on the plains and turned him loose to make his living there. there he set him free again and sat down to watch him. ho ho he likes it better. how the man found his mate 
each tribe has its own stories. yes the bear sat so still and so long that his tail was frozen in the ice but he didnt know it. i have a rabbit in this hole and i want you to help me dig him out. ho the bear tried to get up but he couldnt. then the fox ran away laughing at the bear. i remembered it. but i cant say that i know it is true as i can the others. there is another story of how the first man found his wife and i will tell you that. the man had a hard time of it with no clothes to keep him warm and no wife to help him so he went out looking for oldman. i dont like them at all. they give me scraps of meat to eat and wont build a fire. i think you should take better care of me. i have things fixed for you. you go down this river until you come to a steep hillside. there you will see a lodge. then i will leave you to do the rest. go the next morning he started down the river again looking for the steep hillside and the lodge. he kept this up until one of the largest rocks knocked down the lodge and the woman ran out crying. i will help you fix your lodge. i will stay with you if you will only let me. then she let him come inside and eat. finally she made him some clothes and they got along very well after that. if an animal instead of a bird appears in the dream the indian takes his hide claws or teeth and throughout his life never leaves it behind him unless in another dream a greater charm is offered. he said that when he was a boy of twelve years his father who was chief of his tribe told him that it was time that he tried to dream. the great pine groaned and shook until i was sure it must fall. rain came and i grew cold and more afraid. i had eaten nothing of course and i was weak so weak and tired that at last i slept in the nest. i dreamed yes it was a wonderful dream that came to me and it has most all come to pass. part is yet to come. but come it surely will. it was a terrible war and the fighting and the blood made me sick in my dream. there were deep shadows all about him as he approached. who are you and where is your country if you do not listen then i shall turn against you. i think i know him wherever he may be and in any camp. they came over a village of our people and there stopped to look about. i am willing for she is the finest young woman in all the village. she is good in her heart and she is honest. when they had married good women and each had four sons they told the people one day that it was time for them to go away forever. all the people followed them and saw them lie down on the ground in the park. she was terrified almost to death for she knew that the tigers were the most cruel of all beasts. she begged of the mouse to help her to escape and the mouse having a tender heart gave her what aid was in her power. he hastened to make his strange discovery known to his mother and entreated her to lodge the maiden without delay in the palace and to let her become his wife. in their great misery they sought counsel of mankind whom they knew to be wiser than any of the animals. these appeared such easy terms that the birds readily agreed to them. she worked on patiently and kept her own counsel while the birds waited and watched. she worked patiently on and kept her own counsel while the birds waited and watched. she still patiently worked on and kept her own counsel. at sight of her his heart melted like water within him for the love of her. the birds when they saw his beautiful feathers greeted him with wonder and admiration. in the mountain there lived a god. the moment she saw the flowers she gave a cry of delight and held out her hand to take them. it became a much more beautiful place and in time mankind came here from heaven to dwell. when he had made all satisfactory arrangements he took his departure and went on his long journey accompanied by the good wishes of his people. he ordered them to come down from the trees and to lead their sister to him. so they made preparations for a great feast but they did not invite anybody except their own tribe to attend. thereupon they retired to a safe distance. you are unable to perform it yet when i come to offer assistance you laugh at me. his mother entreated and warned him but all in vain. like all twins they were never happy if long separated. a silver necklace a silver necklace the great god saw their difficulty from heaven and he sent one of the heavenly beings down to the earth in the likeness of a young man to teach them. upon this mankind took counsel together what to do. some feared that if they let him go away he would never return. this satisfied them and they let him go. the following story tells how that came to pass. thus it was that the dog came to live with man. as they grew up they were not able to spend so much time together. but the old friendship remained as firm as ever between the two young men they trusted one another fully and the one kept no secrets from the other. in the course of time they took to themselves wives and became the heads of families. thus circumstances kept the two friends apart for they seldom met. he determined to enter. the neighbours will say that i killed these people it will be useless for me to deny it for i have such an evil reputation nobody will believe me. it was a very hot day and the animals as they travelled to the fair eagerly sought the shelter of the trees. as soon as the animals left the grove she summoned together all her tribe to consider how to proceed so as to beat the stag in the long race. she and her husband lived very happily together and rejoiced in the possession of a baby girl of great beauty. she wildly demanded the meaning of the awful discovery whereupon the man confessed his crime and also told her how she herself had eaten of the flesh of her own child. they lived very happily for many long years the children showing great respect to their mother and to one another. sometimes he would absent himself from home for many days and none of his family knew whither he wandered. and he pointed out a large tree in the middle of the forest. so the great god to help him began to question him. now this stranger was a demon but the man did not know it. and he passed the net to him. this time the man did not resist but accepted a cake of bread and ate it with enjoyment after which the stranger departed taking his bag of cakes with him. henceforth thou and thy race shall be tormented by the strange being whose food thou hast eaten. she had never seen such a beautiful bird and to please him she sang to him one of her sweetest songs. persons in love never take heed of other peoples advice. so in great distress she took him down to the plains where there was a big river along which many boats used to sail. by and by a large boat was seen approaching with great white sails which frightened him greatly and sent him running into a thicket with all his might. after eating these he went to sleep satisfied and happy. but the idiot boy saw nothing of these things his simple mind was absorbed in the one thought food. once she ventured to speak to her brother on the matter asking him what glory there was in being king if his family were obliged to work and to fare like common folks. he thought out many plans of escape but not one of them could be put into execution and he was driven to face the doom of certain death. the man was so pleased with his seeming good fortune that at parting he took off his polished mirror which was suspended round his neck by a silver chain and begged his companion to accept it in remembrance of their short but strange encounter. but the fox hearing some noise turned round suddenly and by that movement the polished mirror came right in front of the tigers face. thus the tiger received strength and man received the gift of skill. the following story gives an account of her flight from the animals to make her dwelling with man. so the goats ran away from the jungle for ever and came to live with mankind. after this the ox came back sorrowfully to mankind and for food and for shelter he offered to become their servant and because he was strong and patient mankind allowed him to become their servant. the two men took their books and departed as they were commanded. he was in great trouble when he saw that the book was destroyed. last of all he came to the dwelling of the poor family where as usual they had not enough food to satisfy their own need yet when they saw the aged beggar standing outside in the cold their hearts were filled with pity. but by keeping the animal alive for many days i became so fond of it that i could not kill it. the two lived very happily in this village the mother leading an industrious life for she did not wish to depend for their living on the gold gained at the expense of her sons tears. upon opening the chest he found it full of fine clothes and precious stones such as are worn only by great princes these he took and made into a bundle to bring home. one day when her son was absent she determined to peep into it to see what was hidden there. she was even less likely to find any one willing to risk his life to get it without knowing for whom and for what purpose and she wept bitterly. he entered the house quickly before his mother had time to close the lid of the chest. you may read it word for word in the pages that come next. the paradise of children. her name was pandora. the first thing that pandora saw when she entered the cottage where epimetheus dwelt was a great box. then everybody was a child. it was a very pleasant life indeed. o what a good time was that to be alive in this ugly box i am so taken up with thinking about it all the time. still however she could not help thinking and talking about the box. it was quicksilver and he brought one hither as well as the box. he was tired to death of hearing about the box and heartily wished that quicksilver or whatever was the messengers name had left it at some other childs door where pandora would never have set eyes on it. the box the box and nothing but the box after epimetheus was gone pandora stood gazing at the box. as the child had no other lookingglass it is odd that she did not value the box merely on this account. but here and there peeping forth from behind the carved foliage pandora once or twice fancied that she saw a face not so lovely or something or other that was disagreeable and which stole the beauty out of all the rest. nevertheless on looking more closely and touching the spot with her finger she could discover nothing of the kind. the most beautiful face of all was done in what is called high relief in the centre of the lid. pandora had looked at this face a great many times and imagined that the mouth could smile if it liked or be grave when it chose the same as any living mouth. the features indeed all wore a very lively and rather mischievous expression which looked almost as if it needs must burst out of the carved lips and utter itself in words. what harm can there be in opening the box never mind that poor simple epimetheus you are wiser than he and have ten times as much spirit. there appeared to be no end to this knot and no beginning. there would be no harm in that surely. even epimetheus would not blame me for that. but children led so easy a life before any troubles came into the world that they had really a great deal too much leisure. when life is all sport toil is the real play. there was absolutely nothing to do. and then for the rest of the day there was the box after all i am not quite sure that the box was not a blessing to her in its way. it supplied her with such a variety of ideas to think of and to talk about whenever she had anybody to listen and many a kick did the box but it was a mischievous box as we shall see and deserved all it got many a kick did it receive. what could it be indeed do you think that you should be less curious than pandora but you would not do it. no no only if you thought there were toys in it it would be so very hard to let slip an opportunity of taking just one peep but pandora was convinced that there was something very beautiful and valuable in the box and therefore she felt just as anxious to take a peep as any of these little girls here around me would have felt. and possibly a little more so but of that i am not quite so certain. on this particular day however which we have so long been talking about her curiosity grew so much greater than it usually was that at last she approached the box. she was more than half determined to open it if she could. ah naughty pandora first however she tried to lift it. it was heavy quite too heavy for the slender strength of a child like pandora. a moment afterwards she almost fancied that she heard something stir inside of the box. or was it merely the singing in pandoras ears or could it be the beating of her heart the child could not quite satisfy herself whether she had heard anything or no. but at all events her curiosity was stronger than ever. as she drew back her head her eyes fell upon the knot of gold cord. meanwhile the bright sunshine came through the open window as did likewise the merry voices of the children playing at a distance and perhaps the voice of epimetheus among then. pandora stopped to listen. what a beautiful day it was nothing was to be done therefore but to let the box remain as it was until epimetheus should come in. o very naughty and very foolish pandora well yes i am resolved to take just one peep only one peep and then the lid shall be shut down as safely as ever but nothing went right nor was he nearly so happy as on other days. for you must recollect that at the time we are speaking of it was everybodys nature and constant habit to be happy. the world had not yet learned to be otherwise. not a single soul or body since these children were first sent to enjoy themselves on the beautiful earth had ever been sick or out of sorts. but with a hope of giving her pleasure he gathered some flowers and made them into a wreath which he meant to put upon her head. she was too intent upon her purpose. at the moment of his entering the cottage the naughty child had put her hand to the lid and was on the point of opening the mysterious box. epimetheus beheld her. but epimetheus himself although he said very little about it had his own share of curiosity to know what was inside. and if there were anything pretty or valuable in the box he meant to take half of it to himself. so whenever we blame pandora for what happened we must not forget to shake our heads at epimetheus likewise. as pandora raised the lid the cottage grew very dark and dismal for the black cloud had now swept quite over the sun and seemed to have buried it alive. naughty pandora now if you wish to know what these ugly things might be which had made their escape out of the box i must tell you that they were the whole family of earthly troubles. had they been faithful to their trust all would have gone well. no grown person would ever have been sad nor any child have had cause to shed a single tear from that hour until this moment. meanwhile the naughty pandora and hardly less naughty epimetheus remained in their cottage. besides all this they were in exceedingly bad humor both with themselves and with one another. she was crying bitterly and sobbing as if her heart would break. suddenly there was a gentle little tap on the inside of the lid. but either epimetheus had not heard the tap or was too much out of humor to notice it. at any rate he made no answer. you are inside of the box naughty creature and there you shall stay there are plenty of your ugly brothers and sisters already flying about the world. they are no brothers and sisters of mine as you would see at once if you were only to get a glimpse of me. come come my pretty pandora epimetheus too though still in the corner had turned half round and seemed to be in rather better spirits than before. come my dear pandora lift up the lid. i am in a great hurry to comfort you. never fear there may come times and seasons now and then when you will think that i have utterly vanished. and so they did and not only they but so has everybody trusted hope that has since been alive. i have felt them already and expect to feel them more as i grow older. what in the world could we do without her after the story. dont you think her the exact picture of yourself i know there is not trouble enough in the world to fill such a great box as that. poor fellow meantime the day was drawing towards its close. out of doors the scene certainly looked dreary. there was this same longing for truth among the roman people as well as among the greeks. there have been certain changes in two thousand years on our earth. there were many more than these making the great immortal family of the gods like men but different in their higher understanding of life and its meaning. they were more than this. they ask. they separated the earth from the sea first and then the sky from both of these. but the earth was not finished then by any means. this figure of clay stood upright. each creature was given that which he most needed. the deer was given his slender limbs and the dove his wings. epimetheus was greatly interested in the man that his brother had made and he felt that he might be in danger from the wild beasts that were now so numerous and haunted the forests. in this way he brought down fire to the earth. that was the most useful gift he could possibly have given man. he could defend himself from wild beasts with the spear he made and cut down trees with his axe for building a stronger home. it seemed as if the earth was going to be a very good place indeed for man and his children but after awhile all kinds of unexpected things began to happen. men were not satisfied with what the surface of the earth could give them but dug deep down underneath it and brought up gold and precious stones about which they fought among themselves each wanting to possess more than his neighbor. in the beginning before the forge fires were lighted there had been a golden age. then the fields had given all the food that man needed. but the gods sent the silver age not so pleasant as the one of gold. man learned then what it was to be too cold in the winter and too warm in the summer. then came the bronze and the iron ages. jupiter decided that the people of the earth should be further punished. such a flood as followed the earth was nearly all sea without shore the hills were the only land and people were obliged to ride from one to another of them in boats while the fish swam among the tree tops. if an anchor was dropped it found a place in a garden. they had not forgotten how to build and mine and plant and harvest and keep a home. they would have to begin things all over again they knew and there were two ways of going about it. a strange old story is it not but it is also a story of today. her name was pandora. the first thing that pandora saw when she entered the cottage where epimetheus lived was a great box. whenever a child wanted his dinner he found it growing on a tree. it was a very pleasant life indeed. at last she spoke to epimetheus. epimetheus exclaimed. and his face expressed so much horror at the idea of looking into a box which had been given him on condition that he never open it that pandora thought it best not to suggest it any more. still she could not help thinking and talking about it. asked pandora. cried epimetheus. it was mercury and he brought me here as well as the box. ever since she had come he had heard about that box nothing but the box and he was tired of it. it was made of a beautiful kind of wood and was so highly polished that pandora could see her face in it. the most beautiful face of all was done in high relief in the centre of the box. what harm can there be in opening a box. never mind that poor simple epimetheus. you are wiser than he and have ten times as much courage. and on this particular day when pandora was alone her curiosity grew so great that at last she touched the box. she was more than half determined to open it if she could. first however she tried to lift it. it was heavy much too heavy for the slender strength of a child like pandora. a moment afterward she almost thought that she heard something stir inside the box. she was not quite sure whether she heard it or not but her curiosity grew stronger than ever. suddenly her eyes fell on a curious knot of gold that tied it. and then the thought came into her naughty little heart that since she would be suspected of looking into the box she might as well do so at once. she lifted the lid nearly upright and looked inside. pandora let fall the lid and looked up to see what had befallen epimetheus. nor was it a great while after before pandora herself began to cry. now if you wish to know what these ugly things were that made their escape out of the box i must tell you that they were the whole family of earthly troubles. there were a great many species of cares. there were more than a hundred and fifty sorrows. had they been faithful to their trust all would have gone well with them. no grown person would ever have been sad nor any child have had cause to shed a single tear from that hour until this moment. meanwhile the naughty pandora and epimetheus remained in their cottage. as for poor little pandora she flung herself upon the floor and rested her head on the fatal box. she was crying as if her heart would break. suddenly there was a gentle little tap on the inside of the lid. cried pandora lifting her head. but epimetheus was too much out of humor to answer her. again the tap epimetheus too had left his corner and seemed to be in better spirits. so with one consent the two children lifted the lid. asked pandora. never fear so pandora and epimetheus found hope and so has everybody else who has trusted her since that day. they thought they could easily do this for there were none of the gods who could hurt them the giants were proof against all their weapons. they believed that this wonderful place among the clouds was theirs by right just because they were larger and stronger than the heroes. there was no question at all about this light being apollos and coming as a gift to men from mount olympus because of his great deeds. apollo decided to preserve this cave. that was not all either that apollo had accomplished for the good of men. but the giants could see little value in apollos light. they had hearts made of solid stone which could never beat and feel warm. that was why the giants made preparations to climb up the steep sides of mount olympus. no one in all greece dared to try and stop this war of the giants. it seemed as if the giants were going to win for even the gods were frightened and made haste to change their forms. the mighty jupiter took upon himself the figure of a ram. but mars the god of war got out his chariot and went to meet the giants and the others returned at last for there was really no courage like theirs. the battle was still with the giants though for no weapons could kill them. they needed the light. but the giants had neglected to bring any sunshine with them and it was suddenly as dark as night on mount olympus. but they suddenly discovered that they had nothing to eat. that was the end of the giants. but what usually happens to them in the end is just what happened to the giants who started out to destroy mount olympus. they went inside following the sound of the hammer. in the very depths of the mountain they saw a sight that had never been seen on earth before. his triumph would have been complete but he had an enemy among the company of the gods on mount olympus. apollo and mars were then and will be for all time enemies light and music and song have no sympathy with war. on his way he stopped at the palace of the sun. nymphs played in the sea rode on the backs of fishes or sat on the rocks and dried their long hair. autumn carried his arms full of grapes and winter wore a mantle of bright ice and snow. seeing this beauty the hero forgot his wound. he was making his way through the forest one day with a mighty bear that he had just slain over his shoulder when he came suddenly upon a clearing and in its midst there stood a fair white castle its towers reaching above the pine trees toward the sky. he turned away to conceal a smile as he answered. he opened his eyes and could see again. to this day no one seems to have been able to account for it or understand it. no one spoke watching the wonder and suddenly the cloud began to take form and shape. they asked each other. and even as they wondered the second strange thing happened. but this is what happened that long ago morning in spring. things were very different on the earth after the coming of venus. the whole world had been looking for her and hoping for her coming although they had not really known this desire of their hearts. there had never been a boy even who was able to beat her in a race. and he asked venus to help him in the race. at first he gained. again he threw down a golden apple. then she ran on again. venus had been quite sure that this would happen. the goddess of love had other work to do on earth. venus watched over everything that was beautiful on earth. but he closed his heart to men and he felt that there was no woman living who was worthy to share his kingdom. he dressed her in silk and put jewels on her fingers and a necklace about her neck. she wore ear rings and many strings of pearls. when he had done all this venus rewarded him. he was able to hear the silvery song of his fountain that he had never noticed before. it was a pity that anything so dreadful should have happened on such a day as that. all greece was beginning to talk of this youth theseus the son of the king of athens. they called him a girl and told him that he should not be out alone in public. he was growing old and theseus was his hope for the throne of athens. when they escaped he set guards along the entire shores of the island and had all ships searched so that the two might not leave by sea. he had wanted all his life to see the city of the gods on mount olympus and now his chance had come to reach it. perseus waited until she was so weary that she sank down on the stones of the cave and slept. perseus had no ambition to take this golden harvest. as perseus approached the coast he saw a terrible sight. he asked. at last she explained to perseus. the hero had a sudden thought to save him from destruction. he and all his followers were turned to stone. he had been driven from the throne and was a prisoner of state. this horse was known as pegasus and there was never before or since so marvellous a creature. it was a beast far beyond any of mortal kind in terror. it had a goats rough body and the tail of a dragon. minerva was the goddess of wisdom and might give him help in his hopeless adventure. they needed a kind of dream horse like pegasus with wings to carry them on his back to mount olympus whenever they wanted to return from the earth. he was always lame and blind after that. it really had not been the fault of pegasus at all. he was only the steed of those who followed dreams even if he did have wings. it even seemed to him that his wings were nothing but a dragging weight and that he would never be able to use them again. that might have been the end of this winged horse but one day good fortune came to him. he was a young poet. it was suddenly as if one of the gods were riding pegasus. they exclaimed. it was driven by two other attendants of war alarm and terror the face of one as dark as a thunder cloud and the other with a countenance as pale as death. one man cried. and another answered him. strange words for a noble people to speak to one another in a time of such need were they not it was never the purpose but always the battle that gave him pleasure. mars palace on mount olympus was a most terrible place. but in an instant something happened. there was a roar as if wild beasts of the forests for miles around had been captured and the earth trembled as it did when the giants were thrown out of the home of the gods for mars had fallen and was crying about it. it was really rather amusing for mars was not hurt. he was only taught a much needed lesson. that put mars to work in a very different way. the fishermen and sailors who crowded the beach asked. out of the crack in the rock burst a spring of water where there had been not a drop through all the centuries before. the green shoot of a tree suddenly appeared pushing its way up through the hard stone. they shouted. that is just what had happened. you will remember that the gods were very much like men in wanting particular kinds of gifts which would be their very own and which they could treasure. now her wish had come true for she had a very large and beautiful one the fair athens. everyone was growing very prosperous and very rich. minerva with her flaming spear raised and her eyes filled with tears went to her father jupiter to beg for the safety of her city. the old athens was gone and it was necessary to build a new city. she and the greeks with the help of all the other gods went to work to make athens such a city as had not been dreamed of before. the best holiday of all was minervas own. she raised her head when cadmus appeared and walked slowly before him. cadmus pushed his way into it and when he was inside the cave it seemed as if he had left the world behind so dark was it with the shadows of the boughs and thick leaves. he covered himself from head to foot with a lions skin. the serpents weight bent and twisted the tree as it struggled to free itself but at last cadmus saw it give up the fight and hang there quiet in death. then a marvellous thing happened. so cadmus obeyed the command. one day he brought forth the result of his work. the girls face flushed with anger. she looked up and in their place saw an old dame standing beside her. i know what i say and i mean it. i am not afraid of the goddess. she was going to use her skill of hand and all her art for evil instead of good. her fingers fastened themselves to her side and served for legs. she hung from the vine which changed to a long gray thread. hercules began life just like any other baby except that his father was the mighty jupiter a fact which made everyone expect a great deal of him. and just as used to happen in your old fairy tales he had enemies because of his noble birth. hercules lay in his cradle one day before he was able to walk even and he suddenly saw something that would have frightened anyone much older than he. people began to look at hercules in wonder after that. there were still those who admired him and those who hated him knowing that he was really the son of a god. there had never been known so huge a lion with such wide blood thirsty jaws. hercules asked. hercules was ready to dare this adventure. going up to it hercules struck off one of its heads with his club. what was his surprise to see two heads grow in the place of this one this was indeed a labor with very little of the spirit of adventure in it. hercules had no such thought as this however. hercules made up his mind that he would take advantage of his power over the river god in his present need. hercules set out for the place and when he reached it he discovered that not only the giant but a huge dog that had two heads guarded the oxen. what labor was there left for this son of mount olympus he sent hercules on what seemed indeed a wild goose search. they were very plump and beautiful apples made altogether of solid gold. however that may be the greeks wanted them very much. it would have been a task to pick them even if one had known where to go for them. it was like magic but hercules found out at last the secret of antaeus strength as you also will in the next story and did battle with him. at last even his enemies on mount olympus were forced to grant him a place of honor in their midst and jupiter wrapped him in a cloud and sent a four horse chariot to bring him home along the road of the stars. the kings palace was about as tall as a dolls house and this and the rest of their houses were built neither of stone or wood. their giant friend antaeus was so very tall that he carried a pine tree for a walking stick. in spite of the difference in their size it seemed as if antaeus needed the pygmies for his friend as much as they did him for the protection he was to them. no creature of his own size had ever talked with him. when he stood with his head among the clouds he was quite alone and had been so for hundreds of years and would be forever. even if he had met one of the other giants antaeus would have fancied the earth not large enough for them both and would have fought with him. the pygmies had but one thing to trouble them in the world. his head was in one part of the kingdom and his feet in another and he was taking what comfort he could while the pygmies scrambled over him and played in his hair. as it came nearer what should it turn out to be but a human shape not so large as antaeus but an enormous figure when compared with the pygmies. dont you see that i am sleepy as for my name it is hercules. i will make a slave of you and you shall likewise be the slave of my brothers here the pygmies. so throw down your club. he ran at hercules and brought down another blow. then watching his opportunity as the giant rose again hercules caught him round the middle with both hands lifted him high into the air and held him aloft. hercules had guessed this secret it may be well for us all to remember it in case we should ever have to fight with a fellow like antaeus. it was found necessary to hit upon some other way of carrying on the war. he cried and staring about him as if he expected another giant. hercules gazed around for he hardly felt the arrows. he stooped down and taking up the nearest one between his thumb and finger set him on the palm of his left hand and looked at him. hercules asked. your body my little friend is about the size of an ordinary mans finger. the horn of plenty. hercules was massive of limb and of powerful strength. shouted hercules. i am a god and the king of the waters. neither yielded both stood their ground. it charged upon hercules with lowered horns. who were these twins oh that is the end of the story. by chance though she saw a pool of clear water just beyond in the hollow of a valley. they did more than this. their flesh was turned to thick green skin and they could not stand erect. i am no rude peasant but one of the gods and i know all things present or future. his panting breath touched her neck. in her terror she did not stop to understand that he pursued her only because he loved her so much and that he would not do her any harm. at last she came to the edge of a stream. the youth exclaimed but his sister had disappeared. there are some people like that. i shall show you though. that was indeed a bold plan on the part of this youth who had not been beyond the shores of his native land in all his life. on apollos right hand and on his left stood the days the months and the years and at regular intervals the hours. he asked sternly. he said. apollo drew back in dismay. your arms are mortal and you ask what is beyond mortals power. apollo explained to him with great patience. if i lend you my chariot what can you a boy do i have a strong arm and a steady eye for driving. he asked. there was but one course left then for apollo because a god could never break his promise. the horses go fast enough of their own accord and the difficulty is to hold them in. you are not to take the direct road but turn to the left. you will see the marks of my wheels and these will guide you. night is just passing out of the western gates so you can delay no longer. he looked down at the earth so far below him and he grew pale and his knees shook with terror. the mountain tops took fire and the clouds began to smoke. the whole world was on fire. it was indeed time for the gods to act. one of the great rivers of the earth received him and tried to cool his burning frame but he was never again to see the palace of the sun. jupiter could not have his authority put aside in this way and he knew that he must punish apollo. then out of the forest came two lions and two bears as quietly as if they had been sheep. but not one was to be found. each subject wished someone else to make the sacrifice. was asked but these aged people felt that they could not bear to be parted from him for even a short time and looked to others. what was to be done about it. then a very strange and wonderful thing happened. it had never for an instant entered the minds of anyone that she could be offered to the gods in the place of the king. he knew too that of all the heroes hercules was the strongest. how jupiter granted a wish. each on opening it saw two strangers weary travellers who sought food and a shelter for the night. there was not a single door but was shut in the faces of these travellers. the afternoon was passing and it would soon be dusk. but it opened at once when the strangers knocked to let in the two strangers. then she brought some split sticks and dry branches from a corner where she had kept them like a treasure and put them under the kettle that hung over the fire. afterward she spread a white cloth on the table. suddenly the strangers rose and their disguise of age and travel stained garments fell from them. they were jupiter the king of the gods and his winged son mercury baucis and philemon were struck with terror as they recognized their heavenly guests and they fell on their knees at the gods feet. in the last light of the setting sun they saw the destruction which the people below had brought upon themselves. there was nothing left of the village. then as they turned they saw that their cottage also had disappeared. it had not been destroyed though. it was transformed. and with these words the gods disappeared from earth. one day in the spring when the old couple had become very ancient indeed they stood on the temple steps side by side looking at the new green the earth was putting forth. each grew straight instead of bent with age and their garments were covered with green leaves. the other lad thought for a moment. then he spoke. the first lad replied as if the name was a kind of spell to work magic. that was the wonder that had happened. no one spoke. yours was the suffering and mine the crime. there had never been so beautiful a blossom as this. how king midas lost his ears. what did king midas ask but that whatever he touched might be turned to gold the god consented though and king midas hurried off to test his gift alone so that he need not share it with anyone. he was hungry and could scarcely wait to eat he almost snatched a piece of white bread to begin his meal. it was so with whatever king midas tried to eat fowls fruit cakes all were changed to gold before he had a chance to even touch the food with his lips. midas had the ears of an ass midas commanded. he went out into a meadow dug a hole in the ground and stooping down whispered the secret into it. then he carefully covered it up. and it is said that the meadow reeds blown by the wind tell the story of king midas today. how mercury gave up his tricks. apollo asked him. i followed him for part of the way but i lost them for the child went with the speed of the wind. i could not find their trail again because they left not a single foot print. he was still fast asleep and he was quite alone for he had been born in that cave and knew no other home. it was mercury and he had begun as early as this to play tricks on even the gods. apollo asked mercury angrily. but mercury said not a word. then he drove off with him as fast as he could straight up to the throne of jupiter the king of the gods on mount olympus. then jupiter started for he saw that mercury was himself a god. he might be just then a very naughty and young god but it seemed as if he could do great deeds if only he were to make up his mind to. jupiter called mercury close to his throne and spoke to him. he did something else too. you may see them there today. almost all the gods had their own particular treasures which were in a way the marks of their authority and power. they grew to depend on these and to feel that they could not carry on their good works without them. then he would manage to make up in some way for his mischief and smooth the whole matter over. so mercury took his winged way from one end of the world to the other. mercury was so busy that he forgot to play tricks on either the gods or men and after a while he was accepted as a member in good standing of the family of the gods. there was a place in greece where several roads met. a traveller on foot was not able to see the approach of a swiftly driven chariot and a stranger might easily lose his his way for the roads were not marked. mercury turned out very well indeed in spite of his bad beginning. the gods had one messenger mercury who wore wings on his heels and also on his cap. one day she noticed something happening in the kingdom of her grandfather. it was a long and dangerous journey. even apollo did not dare to approach it at dawn noon or evening. there was a beautiful new dress waiting for her there. have you guessed who she was why of course you have for you see her bridge of colors in the sky after a shower when the sun is shining through the clouds. she was quite alone and suddenly in danger. a black chariot burst into sight drawn by black horses and driven by a man who was dressed in black from head to foot. her flowers fell from her apron in which she had been holding them she screamed but there was no one to hear her. pluto dragged her into his grasp and threw her in the chariot. one of them spun the thread of life and another twisted its bright and dark lines together. i want to go home. she was still weeping and still searching. she was going to search without rest all night. many others saw this goddess in the days that followed. she was weary and sad. the goddess sat there on a stone too tired to go on. they found deep distress in the cottage for the little boy was so ill as to be almost past hope. at last night came and the peasants slept. then the goddess arose and took the little boy in her arms. but just then a strange thing happened. the cottage was filled with a splendor like white lightning and a light seemed to shine from the skin of the goddess. the woman asked in amazement as she saw the boys white cheeks grow rosy with new life. the seed failed to come up. there was too much sun and too much rain. ceres had almost given up hope. i come from the waters. i ran and he followed in an attempt to keep me from going back to my home in the fountain. as i tried to escape him i plunged through the depths of the earth and into a cavern. she was sad but had no look of terror. pluto had made her his queen in the realm of the dead. she summoned her chariot and rode to mount olympus but even jupiter had not complete power over pluto. every tree that she touched with her garments burst into green and wherever her feet pressed the earth the grass and wild flowers appeared and spread. the oak tree had stood for centuries in a grove in which ceres loved to rest and it was almost a forest in itself. it was supposed in those old days of greece to be a tree of wonders. he exclaimed. they cried. all his food had strangely disappeared. he decided to go to bed and try to forget his hunger in sleep. in the morning he woke with a raging hunger that was a hundred times worse than that of the day before. he sold his load of wood and spent all the money for whatever food the earth the air and the sea produced. the amount of food that would have been enough for the whole of athens was not sufficient for this man. each time she made her way home and each time her father sold her to buy food. so the bird flew away to mount olympus and was never seen again. their deepest wish was that they might never be separated. and with that he went back to his bees. he went to the edge of the river where he knew she lived and called her. i have lost my precious bees. you will have to force him to help you however. if you are able to seize him chain him at once he will answer your questions in order to be released. i will conduct you to the cave where he comes at noon to take his nap. then you can easily secure him but when he finds himself in chains he will cause you a great deal of trouble. he asked. he found it very sweet indeed. they were a strange company. she would not give away a single apple and she kept her gate always locked. so the wood creatures were obliged to go home empty handed to their forest places. as soon as the sun began to lower she bade him be on his way. she refused to share even a half of one of her apples. her hair was white and she was obliged to lean on a staff. he is young and handsome and has the power to take upon himself any form that he may wish. she suddenly understood how true was everything that this old woman said. how psyche reached mount olympus. once upon a time there was a king of greece who had three beautiful daughters but the youngest who was named psyche was the most beautiful of all. he fled before the dawn. her sisters came to visit her and increased her fear. take our advice. as she bent down a drop of the burning oil fell on the gods shoulder. he opened his eyes startled and looked up at psyche. then without saying a word he spread his wide wings and flew out of the window. psyche tried to follow him but she had no wings and fell to the ground. that was the beginning of the long road of trouble psyche had to follow. she worked so busily that she did not see ceres whose temple it was enter. when she saw that psyches task was done she scarcely believed her eyes. as she reached the meadow the river god whispering to her through the rushes warned her. the compassion of the river god helped psyche to do as venus had commanded her and she returned to the temple in the evening with her arms full of golden fleece. still venus was not satisfied. psyche felt that now her destruction was surely at hand. but psyche was finding a new courage with each of the difficulties that she had to encounter and she set out with the box. then she started back to the light again. all would have gone well with psyche if she had not grown curious. that was why her road to the dwelling place of the gods was so long and difficult. so she carefully opened the box but there was nothing in it of beauty at all. she did not stir or breathe or remember. he flew through a crack in the window of the palace of venus and made his way to earth and straight to the spot where psyche lay. he gathered the deadly sleep from her body and put it fast inside the box again. then he touched her lightly with one of his arrows and she woke. and the greeks had still another name for psyche whom neither her troubles or the sleep of pluto could keep from the abode of the gods when love pleaded for her. they spoke of her as the soul. so that was what they did. then his eyes caught those of the serpent and he suddenly realized that it had been its voice which he had heard. that was an excellent warning because the farmer had a grove of young trees that needed very tender care. that was exactly what happened. if he sat down to rest on a bank of moss in the forest he was at once surrounded by friends. he had not a thought or care in the world when in an instant he was laid low on the ground from a blow on his head his gold was snatched away from him and he was bound so tightly that he could not move. he looked in all the corners of the room but could see no one. then the voice went on. the robber asked in terror for like most of his kind he was nothing but a coward at heart. he was the first mortal to have such friends but there were others who followed him and found happiness also through being kind to little wild creatures. she had always been obliged to defend herself from the lions and wolves that haunted the forest and she felt that she would be at their mercy now. all at once though she understood what had happened to her. she herself was now no longer a mortal but a wild beast. one day a boy saw the bear as he was out hunting. the boy alarmed raised his hunting spear and ran to meet the bear and thrust its point through her heart. the gods had made a long road in the sky that led to the palace of the sun. they had the form of a great bear and a little bear but their bodies were made of brightly shining stars. it is because my authority has been set aside. but a strange thing was happening to them. it was not used to pasture cattle even or visited by anyone. he wondered to himself. a marvellous sight met him there. the fisherman was completely changed in form. then she returned to her island. what was her horror to discover that she was sinking to her shoulders and then to her head. he plunged into the water and was soon a long distance from the fatal island. he knew how those mortals felt whose loved ones had been taken away from them by the sea and he began using his power to restore the drowned to life again. jason was having a boat built in which he planned to set sail on a kind of pirate expedition. this golden fleece was a prize indeed for it was a good deal like the magic carpet in a fairy tale. there came a time when the queen found it necessary to send her son away from the kingdom for safety as quickly and secretly as possible. jason had a different idea about it however than any youth of greece who had set out for the fleece before. he felt that it was his right in a way because he was going to be a king if he could bring it home. he was willing to give up his throne to the lad jason if he could bring the golden fleece home. and jason was quite willing to be the head of such a pirate expedition with the promise of this advantage at the end. jason did not even build his ship but paid a vast sum of money to have it done for him. jason chose his crew well. jason gasped. in spite of his fear though jason had another thought. the king had said that the fleece must be earned that nothing so golden could be had for the asking. that was really true jason thought and he began to feel a great courage. he was growing into the hero that he always had been at heart being a youth of greece. help came to jason. the bulls rushed into the field toward jason sending forth their burning breath like dragons but jason advanced boldly to meet them. dragons teeth were a strange kind of seed to plant. but suddenly a cry from the crowd startled jason and he looked back. a strange sight met his eyes. in a moment the field was alive with armed warriors advancing upon jason. medea sent a charmed sword to the hero. there was still another danger for jason to face the dragon who guarded the fleece with eyes that never closed. his new courage was equal to it. no one seems to have ever heard of it again. she heard him speak one day of his greatest wish. so when the moon was next in the full medea made her way silently and alone out of the palace when it was the dead of night and all creatures slept. then even as he spoke medea advanced toward the old man and wounded him deeply so that all his blood poured out. it would be very pleasant to end this story by saying that medea always used her art for a good purpose as she did in this case but that was not what happened. what a strange unusual kind of a story is this one of medea what did it mean to the young greeks who heard it it meant for them just what it means for us today. they may result in evil. how a golden apple caused a war. even the gods scrambled to grasp it and for a moment they did not see who had thrown it. for that apple was to be the beginning of a war so long and so terrible that there had never been any other to equal it through all the centuries. no one but the gods knew the secret of paris royal birth. she told him of his royal birth. but at first ulysses pretended that he had lost his reason. this made him safe from any harm that might come to him in battle although she forgot the heel which she had covered with her hand. these alone pleased him. how a wooden horse won a city. then they made up their minds about it. these men when they had eaten said that they would not sail any more over the sea. and truly he saw to his cost he carried a vast bundle of pine logs on his back for his fire and threw them down outside the cave with a great crash. and when the giant had ended his meal he lay down among his sheep and fell asleep. how could he move away the great rock that lay against the door of the cave so they waited until morning. and the monster rose seized two more men and devoured them for his meal. all that day the wise ulysses was thinking what he might best do to save himself and his companions and the end of his thinking was this. then they hid it away. then ulysses gave him the skin again and he drank from it. three times he gave it to him and three times the giant drank not knowing how it would work on his brain. ulysses told his men to be of good courage for the time of their deliverance was come. and ulysses wondered how he and his men would be able to escape. with them ulysses escaped. it fell right in front of the ships bow and washed the ship back to the shore again. he stood up in the boat and called out. so ulysses escaped and all his comrades with him and they came to the island of the wild goats where they found the rest of their men who had waited long for them in sore fear lest they had perished. and they went home in triumph to greece. young. let well alone. you must recollect him of course. ah i perceive you recollect him now. one hundred going and fifty gone how much for them give them a start at something. our friend however was not a little perplexed to find his property. the farmer glanced his eye over the paper. when this part of the east river is filled up it will be just there. he could not believe his senses. glad to see you. i am ruin i am done up upon seeing this i fell into a great rage without exactly knowing why. replied one of the most remarkable voices i ever heard. i could not however perceive any one at all. he in the meantime he continued his talk. look at me i jumped up to examine the clock and found that it had ceased running. this thing speaks for itself. i gave the matter no further consideration and at my usual hour retired to bed. either the fool could not or the villain would not perceive me. looking up i perceived the angel of the odd. for several minutes although he looked me full in the face he said nothing. by these means i somewhat softened the angel. i nodded again. i nodded once more. this thing for very obvious reasons i found it quite impossible to do. in the first place my left arm had been broken in my fall from the ladder and therefore had i let go my hold with the right hand i must have let go altogether. roared the angel of the odd. truly he had a grave time that first winter. the rest is more readily taken for granted. asked one of the little boys after school. experience had given him a degree of confidence and confidence gave him power. after this master horner made his own bargain. here then was the golden opportunity so long wished for poor master horners distress may hardly be imagined. the letters everybody felt that this was everybodys business. may i ask to whom you are engaged this evening we may find the watkinson house so pleasant as to leave it with regret even for mrs. st. if we had only thought of waiting till we could hear from mrs. st. at the back of her head was a wreath of fresh and beautiful pink flowers tied with a similar ribbon. it was but a quarter past nine oclock when their carriage stopped at the watkinson door. the front of the house looked very dark. it is a party yere expecting the room was large and gloomy. inquired mrs. watkinson. we do not give parties looking at the dresses of the ladies. our first duty is to our children and we cannot waste our substance on fashion and folly. you have no idea maam what an extraordinary boy that is. it is only fifteen years since her husband died. he was carried off with a three days illness but two months after they were married. i have had a domestic that lived with them at the time so i know all about it. poor creature how i pity her thank heaven nobody that i know goes to her parties. if they did i would never wish to see them again in my house. it is well she has no children theyd be lost sheep if brought up in her fold. they certainly did not we had just finished hearing these lessons when you arrived. what fault have you imagined whip me ma and punish me as i deserve. said his mother. mrs. watkinson having bestowed a bitter look on edward hastened to turn the attention of his mother to something else. i want him to speak a speech. the child put his thumb into his mouth and remained silent. speak a speech a look is sufficient for them. if they go wrong it will not be for want of education. still it was only half past ten when jane was in the midst of her piece. asked mrs. watkinson. now the truth was that the coachman had come at the appointed time but the noise of janes piano had prevented his arrival being heard in the back parlor. and if you do make them wait awhile wheres the harm i shall certainly as you say tell them not to consider themselves bound to me if they afterwards receive an invitation which promises them more enjoyment. we enjoy that hospitality of which no account is made. it is at least my habit i hope i may say my nature to believe the best of people rather than the worst. under the laughing glancing surface how little they are suspected perhaps love is nothing else than the sight of them by one person. as if it were at all necessary that they should and i have known him sometimes to reply with a kind of dry sad humor not as if he enjoyed the joke but as if the joke must be made that he saw no reason why i should be dull because the season was so. there was no change in his expression. i am not very fond of looking through them. inquired i. it grew dark as we stood in the office talking and taking our hats we went out together. the narrow street of business was deserted. a careless clerk passed whistling. i have never seen them indeed and from what he says i should be rather afraid of being seen by them. i did not ask the question aloud. it is a kind of article for which the demand does not increase with use. if we should all wear spectacles like mine we should never smile any more. i think i have seen the same thing even in this city. he did not seem to grow old and he was one of those who never appear to have been very young. but suddenly the face of a young girl appeared over the side of the vessel and she stepped upon the plank to descend. he was much older than she without doubt. but age as he used to say with a smile of immortal youth is a matter of feeling not of years. i cannot quite tell whether when you grow older you will regard it as a gift of the greatest value or as something that you had been happier never to have possessed. my parents were both dead and my grandmother had entire charge of me. then the scene changed and no longer a green meadow with boys playing but a spot which i did not recognize and forms that made me shudder or smile. if i felt myself warmly drawn to any one i struggled with the fierce desire of seeing him through the spectacles. here sat a family at breakfast and i stood at the window looking in. i removed my glasses and looked with my eyes at the wife. ah me it was terrible but they had not the love to give. i used to tear my glasses away from my eyes and frightened at myself run to escape my own consciousness. they did the wrong thing. they called green yellow and black white. i looked and lo but one was a well of cool deep water and looking suddenly in one day i saw the stars. i tried to find employment but men were shy of me. i tried to teach for i loved children. i am not easily frightened. i think i have heard something of your secret. you have a pair of spectacles i believe that you value very much because your grandmother brought them as a marriage portion to your grandfather. now if you think fit to sell me those spectacles i will pay you the largest market price for glasses. what do you say you little fool cried he impatiently as he saw that i intended to make no reply. for days for weeks for months i did not take my spectacles with me. but she could not stay away. she could not resist my voice in whose tones burned all the love that filled my heart and brain. in that dream of peace. i was merely aware that she was in the room. i saw nothing else. i heard nothing. there was silence for many minutes. i had become their slave. i had nothing more to fear. having seen myself i was compelled to see others properly to understand my relations to them. the lights that cheer the future of other men had gone out for me. i mingled with men but with little pleasure. my dear friends do not forget that i had seen myself. it is clear that no orange flower will ever bloom for her. he was no longer young you know when i came and his fame and fortune were secure. certainly i have heard of few men more beloved and of none more worthy to be loved. their manner told no tales. whenever i am greatly interested i am compelled to take them out and see what it is that i admire. i saw that the dear woman had yet one question to ask and had been earnestly hoping to hear something that would spare her the necessity of asking. it was past midnight and our guest arose to go. i saw in her eyes that she would ask her question. it was in church and she was kneeling with her eyes closed so that she did not see me. the door closed and he was gone. a charming place it was and is. alas enough to do and all so real and so grand if this vision could only have lasted. but such power there was and is. it was then that on my wifes suggestion i resolved to look out for a double. i saw my man he had on no spectacles. but i saw at once that he was of my height five feet four and a half. he had black hair worn off by his hat. so have and have not i. he stooped in walking. so do i. his hands were large and mine. reader so have i it never occurred to him that dennis might be more than fourteen years old. at first i had a feeling that i was going to be at great cost for clothing him. but it proved of course at once that whenever he was out i should be at home. he had orders never to show himself at that window. after i had given him his orders i never saw him till the next day. you see you cannot help yourself if you would. the poor fellow had missed his way read the street signs ill through his spectacles very ill in fact without them and had not dared to inquire. on his entrance all was changed. sunshine. think of this reader for men who know the world is trying to go backward and who would give their lives if they could help it on well but this arrangement did not long continue. but dennis went to the next meeting and liked it very much. thus far i never had any difficulty with him. i confess i hated to go. and that was just what we did. he sat in the carriage at the door while we entered. oh polly died of laughing as she told me of it at midnight gallant eve that she is no but of course she sternly refused. whether this was i or dennis i never really knew. and a very valuable member he made. dennis himself as i said never spoke at all. certainly the worst use you can make of a man is to put him in prison but that double is almost as charming as the original. all this i know. let me stop an instant more however to recall were it only to myself that charming year while all was yet well. heavens how little i had done with them while i attended to my public duties we saw each other sometimes. it was thus it happened. from that moment to this moment he has been of no use that one can see at all. children have bad habits in that way. the movement of course was absurd but we all did our best to forward not it but him. i went out. polly good soul night came and i returned. i heard her story. i was sorry. but polly had promised to beg me and i dared all i told dennis to hold his peace under all circumstances and sent him down. there were a thousand people. they became impatient. he came in direct from the train at last really ignorant of the object of the meeting. the audience were disappointed but waited. but the look was enough. my best friends stared. alas it was i and dennis now completely lost tried as his last shot no. no we left town at seven the next morning. i came to no. i am the first settled minister in no. we raise corn enough to live on in summer. he then threw open the double gates for us to ride through. said my friend. said my friend. iii. we both confessed ignorance. we all nodded. here are a few of them
    times. post. stop world. dr. owl. read all o th pay. o the    o o my the mention of several new york papers led to two or three questions. really we tried but couldnt guess. he said. here again the class failed. he exclaimed pointing to the outside prospect. why is a a a like a a a  give it up he smiled a pleasant smile as if it were all plain enough. if that was the design it succeeded. i let him go on in his own way and never interrupted him once. any way that suited the other man would suit him any way just sos he got a bet he was satisfied. and you bet you he did learn him too. him pretty near up to his chin and set him on the floor. he did not kiss her. many very good men never kiss their wives. this was all that remained of the elders wedding suit of forty years ago. the trousers had soon parted company with their friends. but elder browns eyes were half closed and he was singing at the top of his voice. he was shocked again. never before in all the long years it had served him had he seen it in such shape. the truth is elder brown had never before tried to stand on his head in it. he did his best pulling pressing and pushing but the hat did not look natural when he had finished. elder brown was not however a man for tears. he was a man of action. the minute passed and four more joined it. then the desk man turned. the elder was not in the best of humor when he arrived and his state of mind had not improved. i did not recognize you at once. the man of business had already lost interest. wait till later in the season and come again. money is very tight now. the papers were drawn. what would the old lady say alas elder brown knew too well. what she would not say was what puzzled him. to turn back and search for the lost paper would have been worse than useless. only one course was open to him and at it went the leader of his people. to the suggestion of the slave whom he had in charge for the time being that the articles be laid aside until he had finished he would not listen. as elder brown paid his small score he was at peace with the world. elder brown paused at the door as he was about to leave. what a singular power is habit then a brilliant idea rose in his mind. he entered a store near at hand. was it chance or fate that brought elder brown in front of a bar elder brown beheld for an instant the familiar scene within. but he did not speak. the girl laughed. she could not help it. no maam. he laughed again and so did the girls. how could you indeed sir. i think you did wrong. he only saw reproach. again the elders face shone with delight. now here is one pink silk with delicate pale blue feathers. just the thing for the season. the old man laughed until his cheeks were wet. he thrust his change somewhere into his clothes and beat a retreat. it had occurred to him that he was nearly drunk. he found himself utterly unable to walk straight. he had made an early start that day and for hours he stood in the sun awaiting relief. he lifted up his honest voice and cried aloud for joy. then he passed from view. the next instant she had seized him. as i live if the man aint drunk elder brown elder brown for the life of me cant i make you hear the elder made an effort to wave her off. hey hole on you hannah by this time she was turning his pockets wrong side out. oh elder elder elder what did you do it for well now i reckon youll laugh for some cause you will. a black boy darted round the corner from behind which with several others he had beheld the brief but stirring scene. the elder was silent. then he rode on. his early mornings fall had begun to make itself felt. he was sore and uncomfortable. besides his stomach was empty and called for two meals it had missed for the first time in years. the city slept that is the better portion of it did. here and there however the lower lights flashed out into the night. the animal he rode also recognized it and replied until the silence of the city was destroyed. positively he was in the worst humor possible. he yielded again. gloom vanished. he became one of the boys. the fun increased. again elder brown fell into his beloved hat. again he seized the nearest weapon and sought satisfaction. what next well i hardly know. sleep would not come. she had frequently read it in anger page after page without knowing what was contained in the lines. and so on this occasion when she closed the book the fierce anger was gone. she was not a hard woman naturally. fate had brought her conditions which covered up the woman heart within her but though it lay deep it was there still. as she sat with folded hands her eyes fell upon what reaching out her hand she checked the beast. the elder had been asleep. the woman laughed till her eyes ran water. on the day after his marriage he had asked with a look at those who had often said that he was too little to have a wife. now was a chance to rise mr. pike thought. all he wanted he had often said was a start. but this remark i make only in passing. we cant lose much by that. aint that so you know that. every saturday of the world he sent in something or other to his sister. then he looked around for his hat discovered it in time took it into his hands turned it around two or three times then bidding goodbye without shaking hands took himself off. what for look straight at me. the last week of the third month came. the very last day came. whats the news in the country hows your health got a little matter with pink here first. for the lords sake then catching him by his heels he dragged him out of the house into the street. my wife looked at me with a serious expression. asked my wife. i could not deny it. she might have been twentyfive you guessed that she was prettier than she was at twenty and that she would be prettier still at forty. my wife and i exchanged glances. a cloud floated overhead throwing its great shadow over the field where we lay. my wife and i exchanged glances once more. i did. i went up to my wifes room. she asked me. but i was troubled none the less. there are only two. cried my wife. said my wife. it did. it was a small thing. but it looked queer very queer. i think it was a chance shot but it told all the same. do you know each of us had had one the major had had three. but where were they where is yours i shall leave by the six oclock train. my wife and i went out for our mornings walk. there were heavy rings about her pretty black eyes. my wife took a step toward her. but going they were. they moved toward the steps. remarks similar to these had been made by thomas buller and william podington at least once a year for some five years. they were warmly attached to each other and each was the best friend which the other had in this world. but during all these years neither of them had visited the other in his country home. podington was very fond of horses and always drove himself while buller was more afraid of horses than he was of elephants or lions. at last this state of things grew awkward. mr. podington put his hand to his brow and for a few moments closed his eyes. one of these was getting on very well that was buller. buller had been sailing many years and had never been upset. mr. buller rose and stretched out his hand. buller was the first to make the promised country visit. he had not mentioned the subject of horses to his friend but he knew through mrs. buller that podington still continued to be his own driver. in fact i might almost call it beautiful. cried mr. buller. william you seem to have everything exclaimed buller as the train came nearer and nearer. podington laughed. just stop a minute william and let me get out. mr. podington smiled with a superior smile. screamed buller. he cried and not thinking of what he was about he laid hold of his friends arm. cried mr. buller. the wagon had no sooner floated away from the shore than he felt himself at home. he stood up and gazed about him. podington obeyed and the horse slightly changed his direction. cried podington now finding his voice. the water rapidly rose toward the top of its sides. cried podington suddenly rising. exclaimed buller. the poor man was dreadfully frightened he had never even imagined it possible that he should be drowned in his own wagon. cried buller as the water rose over the sides. and the next moment the wagon body sunk out of sight. but it did not go down very far. at this moment the horse made a slight movement. having recovered his breath he now thought it was time to move on. there was no help for it down sat mr. podington and as with a great splash he came heavily upon the seat the water rose to his waist. said he. well get out all right. and the horse stopped. exclaimed podington. mr. buller took off his hat and asked his friend to hold it. he thought of his watch and other contents of his pockets but there was no place to put them so he gave them no more consideration. in a few seconds the upper part of mr. buller rose from the water. asked podington. said he holding up a strip of wet leather. i would have found them sooner if his tail had not got into my eyes. at first mr.
podington held his hands above the water as he drove but he soon found this awkward and dropped them to their usual position so that nothing was visible above the water but the head and neck of a horse and the heads and shoulders of two men. said podington. i wish i hadnt lost my whip. podington was now full of life and energy his wheels were on the hard road and he was himself again. when he found his head was turned toward his home the horse set off at a great rate. cried podington. isnt he a fine horse dont you think it would be wiser for me to walk home william he went to look at bullers boat. he asked the fisherman. replied the man. you could go anywhere in that boat the information that it would be impossible to upset the little vessel had greatly cheered him and he could laugh. i dont want to shock you or make you nervous so i am not going to take you out today on the bay in my boat. about three miles back of us there is a very pretty lake several miles long. if he had to sail at all this kind of sailing suited mr. podington. a canal a quiet lake and a boat which could not be upset. when they reached the town the boat was in the canal ready for them. you know i am not used to any kind of vessel and i am clumsy. i want you to feel perfectly safe. a long rope with a horse attached to the other end of it was speedily made fast to the boat and with a boy at the head of the horse they started up the canal. do you know william that although i did not plan it there could not have been a better way to begin your sailing education. mr. podington smiled and leaning backward he looked up at the beautiful blue sky. cried mr. buller. it was of no use to him. replied podington. stick to your seat my boy he cant keep this up much longer. mr. podington was greatly excited but he was not frightened as buller was. but mr. buller was rapidly losing his wits. the horse seemed to be going faster than ever. suddenly a thought struck him. mr. podington looked about him and almost under his feet saw the anchor. instantly mr. podington was on the shore and running at the top of his speed toward the horse. he cried waving his hat above his head. presently mr. buller approached very much shaken up. he said. that is the thing to do. william cast him loose from the boat before you let him up here comes the boy. now approached the boy. said he. mr. podington agreed with his friend that walking home was the best thing they could do. mr. buller and mr. podington walked back toward the town. he asked. that is a beautiful country you live in. exclaimed podington. you come to my house and you will never so much as hear of it. said mr. buller. i came to see you along o that speech of yours. i was in court. i am relieved my dear madam yes certainly the jury. but er my dear lady need we go as far as that cannot this affair be settled er out of court we must make him pay the colonel bit his lip. ye see thats jest it and thats where you come in. youve got to show what it is tell the whole story your own way. lord he asked politely. she walked to the door. the young girl however broke the silence without looking up. the girl lifted her eyes. they were the eyes of an experienced woman of thirty fixed in the face of a child. what else the colonel saw there heaven only knows said his fair client softly. at least as she gave it. he gravely made her repeat it. there was a long pause. she turned to go. the next day he was at his office at the same hour. no pardon me the colonel did not move. he caught up the colonels stick which was lying on the table. at the same moment the colonel without any apparent effort grasped it by the handle. do you mean you have taken her case perhaps there was something else due possibly to the ladys wonderful eyes of which he had thought much. she said. she put her knees comfortably together and leaned forward for a reply. she dragged her chair nearer his desk. youll tell the whole story your own way youll give him fits and youll make him pay she caught his fat white hand which was lying on the table between her own and lifted it to her lips. just you talk for me as ye did for his old ditch company and youll fetch it every time she laughed with her face glowing although her strange eyes were cast down. did he er give any reason for it at which she rose the colonel rising also. she answered his request with another intelligent look and a nod. he accompanied her to the door. it is unnecessary to say that these words were not reported to the colonel. a murmur ran round the court. it was this he continued which lifted his heart as he approached the building. and yet he had entered it with an uncertain he might almost say a timid step. and why there was a strong sensation. no gentlemen yes gentlemen the words i love you i shall call your attention to one of them. he regarded him seriously. picture to yourself gentlemen the lonely moonlight road beside the widows humble cottage. thats what you owe to him. he wont eat you though hes killed many a better man. the negro flew to the closet joyfully and brought out the bottle. such clothes were surely never made within fifty years. their board money for the month would be due in three days. said he with a surprised look. that evening at dark he returned. i am told that the south has very fair treatment in the play. he laid both shaking hands upon the arms of his chair to rise. before he could rise she pulled him back into his seat. so they remained to the end. the way the audience caught on shows that. in my profession all life belongs to me. now if you will lets let it go at that. i came in to see you about something else. ive been there often enough myself. deliverance came from an entirely unexpected source. the major asked that he be sent up to his study. the major rose and came forward at the old familiar style of address. he loved to recall everything connected with those beloved days. yes i remember now. im glad to see you. whatd i tell you and she was. and so was the major. the major inquired what the old man was doing so far from his home. three hundred dollars. there is something else i wanted you to know. he refused to let me so i did it anyhow. i could easily spare the three hundred. he asked. exclaimed the pretty daughter. the pretty daughter bit her lip. the driver bent suddenly forward. thus commanded the young man swung out and asked the driver about it. the bridge is tore out behind us an were stuck here till that water runs out. who could tell what might or might not happen but this was better much better. the coach might be quickly mended but not the flood. it seemed awful. she was pale but collected. her husband was pink but collected. there being no space left for his address he put none down. he interrupted. uncle billy drew a deep breath. there it was out he wished margaret had stayed to hear him say it. the guest did not seem to be seriously shocked and uncle billy was beginning to be sorry he had not said three dollars when mr. van kamp stopped the landlords own breath. ill be up and make on a fire in a minute. it was not to be borne they would not submit to it ralph too started off for a walk but naturally not in the same direction. no task seemed impossible. he walked in to see the landlord. he asked. he sat down on the porch and lit a strong cigar. his wife did not bother him. getting impossible things was his business in life and she had confidence in him. uncle billy had made one mistake in not asking this sort of folks enough and he reflected in perplexity. retorted uncle billy. uncle billy gravely handed it back. how should she ralph admired the picture very much. the fool he decided that he really had no excuse for coming any nearer. he had not been noticing her at all and yet he had started to her side before she had even cried out which was strange. he anxiously inquired. this was not his first season out either. she had noticed that smile as he stooped. it would be so good for him. he asked. in spite of the sly smile that he had permitted to himself he was unusually interested. he exclaimed making one more brave effort as they came in sight of the hotel. the smile was glowing cheerfully away inside though. he could feel it if he could not see it and he laughed aloud. he really was a clever sort of a fellow in spite of that smile. mrs. van kamp gasped and clutched the arm of her husband. there was no need. she smiled as she thought of ralph. she always managed to get them paid principal and interest. mr. van kamp tore it open and drew out a note. you are quite welcome to make use as my guest of the small room over the kitchen. mr. van kamp passed the note to his wife and sat down or a large chair. mrs. van kamp read the note and the tip of her nose became white. she also sat down but she was the first to find her voice. she exclaimed. this is a house of public entertainment. his wife declared. he shook his head decidedly. he went in to talk with uncle billy. replied uncle billy. roared uncle billy. mr. van kamp promptly counted out the money. all was not yet lost. uncle billy belongs to a large family. uncle billy assured him. they were waiting for ralph to come out and join his parents. ralph it seemed however had decided not to take a walk. it was not there but ralph was. he exclaimed. he laughed lightly. he followed her slowly and was met at the door by her father. ralph scratched his head in amused perplexity. suddenly her lips parted with a smile that revealed a double row of most beautiful teeth. he suggested. there was nothing else that he could do. she gasped. she cried. however this was a time for action. they both stopped stock still then seeing that it was too late to retreat both laughed and advanced. he was quite anxious to know. he cried. she asked. she exclaimed. a fourth hand was needed however. he made out then a dim figure on the other side of ralph. it did not in this case. the two travelers were quite well acquainted when ralph put his head in at the door. exclaimed his father in pleased surprise. mr. van kamp allow me to introduce my son ralph. mr. van kamp and myself ralph have found out that we shall be considerably thrown together in a business way from now on. some one seemed to be waiting for him. suggested mr. van kamp. gasped mr. van kamp. exclaimed aunt margaret when they appeared at the kitchen door. would it do would it do the boy in the road stopped short in his dusty tracks. you can put it on while im getting ready. but it did not come. say maybe that would fill up some. whatd i say whatd i do his knees gave way and he sat down without intending it. dead men tell no tales. he could do that. he found a dry soil. name yours. ask her what piece of music she likes best. name yours. echoed ross. just walk across it like anybody. i ordered em by mail. you can write your name on my card. even retreat was cut off. he sat on his cap. he bent down to his companion. but the needs of babe were instant. he whispered back. if it had been glorious to call upon her how very terrible she would make it should they attempt calling fail and the failure come to her knowledge some things were easier to endure than others he resolved to stay till the call was made. the old man read on and on. the sun sank lower. he wouldnt care what the lamps said then. they did not rise. they did not thunder out anything. the family evidently taking it for granted that the boys would follow went in. demanded ross fiercely. he groaned. i thought you two would be in there ahead of us. there were many things on the table that boys like. they all stared at him. inquired ross in a fairly natural tone. presently both girls quietly disappeared. they sat as though bound in their chairs while the old man read in silence for a while. well be going now. their feet were lead their tongues stiff and too large for their mouths. worn out with misery the boys slept heavily. he turned it. im just that way when i get thrown off the track. he said. there goes the second bell. but ross paying no attention walked swiftly toward the gate. he would never be afraid again. the excitement and curiosity of the society were almost more than could be borne but never a sister let on that she knew the deacon was at the gate waiting. i told him id go if he would bring me around here to let you know what had become of me and so he did. now goodby and ill be sure to be present at the next meeting. the deacon would get good ones but somehow never could he find one that the squire didnt get a better. the squire had also in the early days beaten the deacon in the race for a certain pretty girl he dreamed about. laughed the widow. the deacon looked at her sharply. but the deacon never thought of that. the squire followed suit and the deacon. the road was wide and the snow was worn down smooth. the track couldnt have been in better condition. why didnt he wait till another time when the deacon was alone as he was the fruit of his desire had turned to ashes in his mouth. but no. what of the widow a deep bed of drifted snow lay close by the side of the road not far in front. it was soft and safe and she smiled as she looked at it as though waiting for her. presently an idea struck him and he looked around for the widow. she was not where he had seen her last. where was she he did not care. with her all was lost without her all was won and the deacons greatest ambition was to win. and why simply to make it possible for him to win. the deacon now had forgotten the squire as he had only so shortly before forgotten the widow. shouted the widow tossing her shawl into the air. i know you did. didnt you i saw you pulling ahead at the turn yonder. he repeated anxiously though she looked anything but a hurt woman. now dont you worry about me. and the deacon he always enjoyed his story and himself in the telling. some eye what he ate a bit less he had begun to move in a restless way and worst of all he laughed less frequently. his sense of his position was strong in him he was proud of it. is that the best you can think of i know what you mean though. what you need is let me see yes a nice bottle of wine. ill go with you. he said. how much do you want gideon did not answer he looked very gloomy. wait a minute and i will get it for you. that was all. presently he came to a window before which he paused in delighted wonder. there was more but he had no heart for it he was disappointed and puzzled. this picture had after all nothing to do with him. it was a chance and yet what a strange chance it troubled and upset him. easy childish tears came into his eyes and ran over his shining cheeks. he heard his name being passed from mouth to mouth and came partly to his senses. he was naturally honest. he must content himself with the reflection that he was at that moment wearing his best. gideon stretched himself and looked out of the window and emotion seized him. for all his journey the south had seemed to welcome him but here at last was the country he knew. the train had evidently been there for some time and there were no signs of an immediate departure. what was the hurry there was plenty of time. it was sufficient to have come to his own land the actual walls of home could wait. the question had been a mere matter of form. gideon had made up his mind and if he had been told that they started in five minutes he would not have changed it. the river was not far away. he would get into loose shoes again old ones if money could buy them and old clothes too. as long as he moved at all he was satisfied. his conscience did not trouble him at all. once he awoke. once ashore again however he began to prepare his breakfast with some haste. for the first time in his journey he was feeling a sense of loneliness and a longing for his kind. he was still happy but his laughter began to seem strange to him in the solitude. it was human beyond a doubt. the leaves parted and a smiling face as black as gideons own regarded him in shy amusement. she was merely trying its sound. gideon followed her slowly. her romantic coming and her romantic name pleased him and too he thought her beautiful. a womans voice sounded thin and far away. asked gideon. the girl shook her head. she moved off a step or so and glanced back at him. gideon leaped to his feet. with a bound he was after her one hand catching her lightly by the shoulder. he felt suddenly that he must not lose sight of her. the girl was still laughing but evidently troubled. she screamed and struck at him as he kissed her for now she was really in terror. he took a great breath or so and leaned over and picked her up in his arms where she screamed and struck and scratched at him. presently however he saw her face raised a face still shining with tears. she shook her head not looking at him. again she shook her head. gideon felt very tender very important at peace with himself and all the world. sometimes he took his three boys with him and now and then as a special treat his two little girls were allowed to trot along beside him. this will show you what a kind father he was and you will be very sorry for him when you hear about his troubles. each of the boys had his own little axe at last and each of the girls had a little pair of scissors to cut off twigs and very proud they all were when they brought some wood home to their mother to use in the house. one day however their father told them they could none of them come with him for he meant to go a very long way into the forest to see if he could find better wood there than nearer home. of course they expected their father would come back the day he started for the depths of the forest although they knew he would be late. what then was their surprise when darkness came and there was no sign of him again and again their mother went to the door to look for him expecting every moment to see him coming along the beaten path which led to their door. she was obliged at last to go to bed with a heavy heart fearing some wild beast had killed him and that she would never see him again. he looked up and there quite close to him in a little clearing where the trees had been cut down by some other woodcutter he saw four beautiful young girls looking like fairies in their thin summer dresses and with their long hair flowing down their backs dancing round and round holding each others hands. it isnt even necessary for us to go where your dear ones are. we shall just wish them everything they want and they will get it. and the first thing to be done is to give you some food. he began by cutting a branch from a tree and with it he swept the floor of what was to be the diningroom. then he looked about for the food but he could see nothing but a great big pitcher standing in the shade of a tree the branches of which hung over the clearing. you see that big pitcher. well we get all our food and everything else we want out of it. we just have to wish as we put our hands in and there it is. its a magic pitcher the only one there is in the whole wide world. down he threw his axe and hastened to put his hand in the pitcher wishing for the food he was used to. the fairies often went off together leaving him alone only coming back to the clearing when they wanted something out of the pitcher. the woodcutter got all kinds of things he fancied for himself but presently he began to wish he had his wife and children with him to share his wonderful meals. he began to miss them terribly and he missed his work too. sometimes he thought he would slip off home when the fairies were away but when he looked at the pitcher he could not bear the thought of leaving it. suppose they were hungry when he had plenty to eat it even came into his head that he might steal the pitcher and take it home with him when the fairies were away. but he had not after all the courage to do this for even when the beautiful girls were not in sight he had a feeling that they would know if he tried to go off with the pitcher and that they would be able to punish him in some terrible way. one night he had a dream that troubled him very much. he saw his wife sitting crying bitterly in the little home he used to love holding the youngest child on her knee whilst the other three stood beside her looking at her very very sadly. he started up from the ground on which he lay determined to go home at once but at a little distance off he saw the fairies dancing in the moonlight and somehow he felt again he could not leave them and the pitcher. we dont care to keep unhappy people here. now and then he felt restless but on the whole the time passed pleasantly and the pitcher was a daily delight to him. meanwhile his poor wife was at her wits end how to feed her dear children. when their father did not come back and all their efforts to find him were in vain these boys set to work to help their mother. these neighbours were touched by the courage they showed and not only paid them well for the wood but often gave them milk and rice and other little things to help them. little did they dream of the change that was soon to come into their lives. and if it was a bad thing why you think it was then he had another dream in which he saw his wife and children in the old home with plenty of food and evidently so happy without him that he felt quite determined to go and show them he was still alive. you can just imagine what a shock this was to the fairies you know of course that fairies always keep their word. they all tried all they could to persuade the woodcutter to choose something else. piled up on the floor were sparkling stones worth a great deal of gold and silver money and on the walls hung beautiful robes. no no the pitcher the pitcher he said and at last they had to give it up. they bound his eyes again and led him back to the clearing and the pitcher. even when they were all back again in the clearing the fairies did not quite give up hope of keeping their pitcher. but if you take some of the money you can buy anything you like with it. no cried the woodcutter. the pitcher so they all left off crying and went away hand in hand. fairies do not want very much to eat. he did not bring the pitcher with him but had hidden it in a hollow tree in the wood near his cottage for he did not mean any one to know that he had it. he told his wife that he had lost his way in the forest and had been afraid he would never see her or his children again but he said nothing about the fairies. when his wife asked him how he had got food he told her a long story about the fruits he had found and she believed all he said and determined to make up to him now for all she thought he had suffered. ive brought something back with me. the children too wanted of course to go with their father but he ordered them to stop where they were. very soon he was back again with his basket full of all sorts of good things the very names of which his wife and children had no idea of. am i not a clever father to have found all that in the forest if not why was it not a good thing life was now of course completely changed for the family in the forest. every day their father fetched food for them all and the greatest desire of each one of the family was to find out where it came from. the secret he kept from the wife to whom he used to tell everything soon began to spoil the happiness of the home. she really did mean to do this but something soon happened to change everything again. now the whole family had plenty to eat every day though none of them knew where it all came from. if he had only been content with getting food out of his pitcher and drinking pure water all would most likely have been well with him. but that was just what he could not do. till he had his pitcher he had never drunk anything but water but now he often took too much wine. it was this which led to the misfortune of losing his beloved pitcher. this was the chance his guests wanted. he got angry and at last was actually silly enough to tell them all to come with him and he would show them he was no robber. when his wife heard this she was half pleased to think that now at last the secret would come out of where the food came from and half afraid that something terrible would happen. back they all had to go the woodcutter watching till they were out of sight. when the woodcutter was quite sure that every one was gone and nobody could see where he had hidden the pitcher he took it from the hole in which it lay and carried it carefully to his home. you can imagine how everybody rushed out to meet him when he came in sight and crowded round him so that there was danger of the pitcher being thrown to the ground and broken. am i a robber then getting more and more excited he picked up the pitcher and holding it on his shoulder began to dance wildly about. but he paid no attention to her. it was broken to pieces and a great cry of sorrow went up from all who saw the accident. he was going to pick up the pieces to see if they could be stuck together but to his very great surprise lie could not touch them. could it all have been a dream no for there on the ground were the fruits and cakes that had been in the pitcher and there were his wife his children and his friends all looking sadly and angrily at him. the mouse was in constant fear of the cat and the owl. he knew that both of them could see in the dark and he would have no chance of escape if they once caught sight of him. she was quite wrong in thinking herself so safe for that path got her into very serious trouble. ha exactly what the hunter expected happened. the cat came as usual to watch for the mouse and caught sight of him running across the end of the path. what was his delight when he saw his enemy in such trouble and quite unable to do him any harm the owl flew quietly to a tree hard by to watch what would happen feeling so sure of having the mouse for his dinner that he was in no hurry to catch him. the mouse small and helpless though he was was a wise little creature. he saw the owl fly up into the tree and knew quite well that if he did not take care he would serve as dinner to that great strong bird. he knew too that if he went within reach of the claws of the cat he would suffer for it. as he thought and thought his eyes got brighter and brighter and at last he decided what he would do. he had you see kept his presence of mind that is to say he did not let his fright of the cat or the owl prevent him from thinking clearly. it is true we have never been exactly friends but i have always looked up to you as a strong and noble enemy. if you will promise never to do me any harm i will do my best to help you. when the cat heard what the mouse said she could hardly believe her ears. the owl would certainly not attack him there he thought and the cat could not possibly hurt him. hearing this the mouse pretended to bite the string but took care not to do so really and the cat waited and waited getting more miserable every minute. again and again she entreated the mouse to be quick promising that if only he would set her at liberty she would never never never forget it or do any harm to her beloved friend. it was not until the moon had set and the light of the dawn had put out that of the stars that the mouse made any real effort to help the cat. full well he knew that all the cats promises would be forgotten and that she would eat him up if she could catch him. he had a good look round and then went home without having found out anything. on second thoughts however she decided to try and keep friends with him because he might help her again if she got caught a second time. so she took no notice of the mouse until the next day when she climbed down the tree and went to the roots in which she knew the mouse was hidden. he stayed quietly in his hole and only ventured forth after he had heard the cat climb up into the tree again. for instance can you call it cruel for a cat or an owl to kill and eat a mouse he was a brahman that is to say a man who devoted his whole life to prayer and had promised to give up everything for the sake of pleasing the god in whom he believed and to care nothing for comfort for riches or for good food. he was however willing to take money and when the people who wished to help him found that out they brought him a good many silver and gold pieces. some who had no money to spare gave him jewels and other things which could be sold for money. those who wanted him to tell them what to do paid him for his advice and as some of them had plenty of money and were glad to help him he soon became quite rich. he might have done a great deal of good with all this money by helping the poor and suffering but unfortunately he never thought of doing so. instead of that he got to love the money for its own sake. at night when all those who had come to see him had gone to rest and there was no fear of his being found out he used to steal away into the forest and there he dug a deep hole at the root of a great tree to which he took all his money and jewels. if so what other things eagerly he knelt down full of fear of exactly what had actually happened. the poor man could not at first believe his own eyes. he rubbed them hard thinking that there was something the matter with them. then he felt round and round the hole hoping that after all he was mistaken and when at last he was obliged to believe the terrible truth that there really was not a sign of his money and jewels he became almost mad with misery. then he wept and tore at his hair stamped about and cried aloud to all the gods he believed in making all kinds of promises of what he would do if only they would give him back his treasures. no answer came and he began to wonder who could have done such a terrible thing. as he thought in this way he got more and more angry until he became quite worn out with giving way to his rage. soon he was pouring out all his grief to them and they did all they could to comfort him telling him that he would very soon have plenty more money and jewels. they let him see however that they thought it was mean of him to hide away his riches instead of using them to help the poor and suffering and this added very much to his rage. there was great distress in the town because the people thought the brahman would go away and they did not want him to do that. they were proud of having a man they thought so holy living amongst them and ashamed that he should have been robbed whilst he was with them. they said they would all do everything they possibly could to get it back for him. in spite of all that any one could say to him the brahman was quite determined that he would not live any longer. at first a number of people followed him but by degrees they left off doing so and soon he was quite alone. presently however he could not help noticing a man approaching from the direction in which he was going. very tall very handsome very dignified this man was one whom no one could fail to admire even if he had been only an ordinary person. everybody even the brahman loved the king because he took such a very great interest in his people and was always trying to do them good. he had heard all about the loss of the money and was very much vexed that such a thing should have happened in his land. he had also heard that the brahman meant to kill himself and this distressed him more than anything else because he thought it a very wicked and terrible thing to do. the king stood so exactly in the path of the brahman that it was impossible to pass him by without taking any notice of him and the unhappy man stood still hanging down his head and looking very miserable. i will find your treasure for you and give it back to you or if i fail to do so i will pay you as much as it was worth out of my own purse for i cannot bear to think of your killing yourself. the brahman was greatly delighted to hear this because he knew full well that the king would keep his word and that even if his own treasure was never found he would have plenty of money given to him by the king. the king agreed to go with him at once and he and the brahman went straight away to the big hole in the forest the attendants following them a little way behind. after the king had seen the big empty hole and noticed exactly where it was and the nearest way to it from the town he returned to his palace first telling the brahman to go back to the house he lived in and wait there till he received a message from him. very glad that after all he was not going to die the brahman obeyed willingly and for the next few days he was taken care of by the merchant who supplied him with plenty of food. all the doctors in the place at once hastened to obey each of them hoping that he would be the one to cure the king and win a great reward. one at a time they were taken to the kings private room but very much to their surprise and disappointment he seemed quite well and in no need of help from them. then the attendants led the visitor out. at last however a doctor came who said something which led the king to keep him longer than he had kept any of the others. the merchant knew then for certain that something was seriously wrong and he consented to go to the palace with his servant partly out of curiosity and partly out of fear for himself. when the two got to the palace the attendants at once led the servant to the presence of the king but they would not let the master go with him. the servant who really had taken the money and jewels was so terrified when he found that the king knew the truth that he had not a word to say at first but just remained lying on the ground trembling all over. when the silence had lasted about ten minutes the thief raised his head from the ground and looked at the king who still said not a word. something in his face however made the wicked servant hope that he would not be punished by death in spite of the great wrong he had done. the king looked very stern it is true but not enraged against him. or had ordered him to be beaten. he had put it in another hole in the very depths of the forest and it was a long time before he got back to the palace with it for it was very heavy. he had thought the king would send some guards with him to see that he did not run away and that they would have helped him to carry the sack full of gold and jewels but nobody followed him. it was hard work to drag the heavy load all the way alone but at last quite late in the evening he was back at the palace gates. the soldiers standing there let him pass without a word and soon he was once more in the room in which the king had received him. how his heart did beat as he waited for what the king would say take it away and make a better use of it than before. the brahman glad as he was to have his money and jewels restored did not like to be told by the king to make a better use of them. he would have said more but the king made a sign to his attendants two of whom dragged the sack to the entrance of the palace and left it there so that there was nothing for the brahman to do but to take it away with him. the magic shoes and staff. each was married to a wife he loved and for many years they were all as happy as the day was long. was there any excuse for their leaving their wives behind them the wives were at first very sad and lonely but presently a great joy came to one of them which made the other two very happy as well. one of the other wise things putraka did when he became king was to make great friends with his brahman subjects. if they did they were to say how anxious he was to see them and promise them everything they wanted if only they would return. just what the young king hoped came to pass. only when they heard the name of his mother did they guess the truth. putrakas father knew when he deserted his wife that god was going to give her a child soon which made it even more wicked of him to leave her. now however he forgot all about that only thinking how he could make as much use as possible of the son who had become a king. they meant to get all they could out of putraka too and the three selfish men who were now quite old set off together for the land they had left so long ago. presently they became jealous of putraka and began to wish to get rid of him. he thought and thought how best to manage this and did not at first mean to tell his brothers anything about it but in the end he decided he had better have them on his side. so he invited them to go with him to a secret place to talk the matter over. it was not very difficult to find a man bad enough to take money for such an evil purpose and the next thing to do was to decide where and when the deed was to be done. putraka had been very well brought up by his mother and he often went to a beautiful temple near his palace to pray alone. the murderer was told to wait in this temple and when the young king was absorbed in prayer to fall suddenly upon him and kill him. then when putraka was dead he was to take his body and bury it far away in the depths of the forest where it could never be found. at first it seemed likely that this cruel plot would succeed. to make quite sure the murderer got two other men as wicked as himself to come and help him promising to give them a share in the reward. but the god who had taken care of putraka ever since he was born did not forget him now. as he gazed at the men the guardian faded away and he was left alone with them. putraka looked at them quietly and sadly. he spoke to the men very sternly asking them why they wished to harm him and the chief murderer told him who had sent them. he then gave them some money and told them to leave him. when putraka was alone he threw himself upon the ground and wept very bitterly. he felt that he could never be happy again never trust anyone again. it had been such a joy to him to give them pleasure and yet they hated him and wished to kill him. he wondered whether he was himself to blame for what had happened and began to think he was not worthy to be king if he could make such a mistake as he now feared he had made in being so generous to those who could have such hard thoughts of him as to want to take his life. perhaps after all it would be better for his country to have another king. never in all his life had he thought it possible to be so miserable as he was now. everything seemed changed and he felt as if he were himself a different person. the only thing that comforted him at all was the thought of his mother whose love had never failed him but even that was spoiled by the remembrance that it was her husband who had wished to kill him. she must never know that for it would break her heart
yet how could he keep it from her then the idea came to him that the best thing he could do would be to go away and never see his own people again. as soon as it was light he wandered off into the forest feeling it is true very lonely but at the same time taking a certain pleasure in being entirely his own master which a king can never really be because he has to consider so many other people and to keep so many rules. the men were greatly surprised to hear putrakas voice for they thought that they were quite alone. asked putraka. cried the king laughing as he looked at the things which seemed to him worth very little. exclaimed one of the men angrily. they are worth more than their weight in gold. when putraka heard the wonders which could be done with what he had thought not worth having he determined to get possession of the three treasures for himself not considering that it would he very wrong to take what did not belong to him. putraka agreed and directly they were off he lost not a moment but picked up the bowl and the staff put on the shoes and flew straight up into the air with the treasures. on and on flew putraka full of eager delight in the new power of flight. all he wanted to make him perfectly happy was someone to enjoy his new powers with him. he gave her some money and told her he would like to live with her if she would let him do so. she was only too glad to consent for she was very lonely and the two lived happily together for a long time. she was so anxious that he should be happy that she became afraid he would become tired of living alone with her. i know the very one for you the only one really worthy of you. she is so very lovely that every man who sees her falls in love with her and wants to carry her off. when putraka heard this he was all eagerness to see the princess and at once determined to go forth to seek her. he was more than ever glad now that he had stolen the shoes because he knew that they would carry him even to the top of the highest mountains. the very evening of the day when putraka heard about the princess he started on his journey taking with him his bowl and staff. the old woman gave him very careful instructions which way to go and begged him to come back to tell her how he had got on. he promised he would thanked her for all she had done for him and flew away in a great state of excitement. she watched him till he was quite out of sight and then went sadly into her lonely home wondering if she would ever see him again. it was not long before putraka came in sight of the palace. it was a beautiful night and the moon was shining full upon the room in which the princess was asleep. this woke the princess who started up and was about to scream out aloud in her terror at seeing a man looking in at the window when putraka with the aid of his magic staff made himself invisible. so she gave her consent and immediately afterwards the young king stood within the room looking so noble and so handsome that she too fell in love at first sight. putraka told her all about his life and adventures which interested her very much. she was glad she said that he was a king but she would have loved him just as well whoever he might have been. it was very difficult to persuade putraka to go but at last he flew away. alas he forgot all about the dear old woman to whom he owed all his happiness and she slowly gave up hope of ever seeing him again. so that one night he was discovered by a guardian of the palace. the matter was at once reported to the king who could not at first believe such a thing was possible. the man must have seen a big bird that was all. the princess too was tired because she had lain awake talking to her lover so many nights running that she had had hardly any rest. she noticed how handsome he was and that he was dressed in beautiful clothes. what shall i do now this done she went back to listen at the door. she entreated putraka to make himself invisible and fly away at once. he did so and as usual wandered about until the time should come to go back to the palace. the lady who had been on guard had half a mind to tell her mistress that her secret was discovered. but before she could get a chance to do so she was sent for by the king who asked her if she had seen or heard anything during the night. he was so taken by surprise that though he had his staff in his hand and his shoes and bowl in the pocket of his robes he had no time to write his wishes with the staff or to put on the shoes so he was obliged to submit to be dragged to the palace. he did all he could to persuade those who had found him to let him go telling them he was a king and would reward them well. so he stood quietly at the foot of the throne and looked bravely into the face of his dear ones father. this only made the king more angry and he began calling putraka all manner of names and asking him how he dared to enter the room of his daughter. he was himself a king and would give her all she had been used to. but it was all no good for it only made the king more angry. then putraka with his staff wrote rapidly on the ground his wish that no one should be able to touch him and stooping down slipped on his magic shoes. the king the courtiers and the soldiers all remained exactly as they were staring at him in astonishment as he rose up in the air and flew out of one of the windows. but in the end her lover got his own way and just as those who were seeking him were heard approaching he seized his dear one in his arms and flew off with her. by the banks of the sacred stream the lovers rested and with the aid of his magic bowl putraka soon had a good and delicious meal ready which they both enjoyed very much. amongst the attendants on those children was the old woman who had shown kindness to putraka in his loneliness and trouble. she made him feel quite ashamed of himself and he flew away and brought the dear old lady back with him to her very great delight. they wanted to have everything their own way and they were very jealous indeed of their fathers love for him. it was very much the same with the kings wives. so he in his turn made up a story thinking by its means to find out how she felt for him. the poor queen could hardly believe that she had heard rightly. she knew she had done no wrong and could not understand how putting her in prison could help anybody. she was quite sure that her husband loved her and no words could have expressed her pain at the thought of being sent away from him and her dear son. he longed to take his wife in his arms and tell her he would never let her go and perhaps if she had looked at him then he would have seen all her love for him in her eyes but she remained perfectly still with bowed head waiting to hear what her fate was to be. so the king summoned his guards and ordered them to take his wife to a strong prison and leave her there. great then was his disappointment when the wicked woman told him she had discovered a plot against his life. for all that he could not get the matter out of his head. this was what made him uneasy. this distressed him very much and after seeking it in vain he summoned all those who were employed in the palace to his presence and asked if any of them knew anything about the arrow. he promised that he would forgive any one who helped him to get it back even if it were the thief himself but added that if it was not found in three days he would have all the servants beaten until the one who had stolen it confessed. now i will help you to prevent this by getting rid of sringabhuja. the king himself and all his court were watching the scene from the walls and it was difficult for the guards to keep the course clear. now as very often happens something no one in the least expected upset the carefully planned plot. where is your youngest brother sringabhuja then sringabhuja told the maiden all about himself and why he was wandering so far from home. she said. he returned home but yesterday and i drew the arrow from his wound and dressed the hurt myself. she too felt drawn towards him and did not like to think of his going away. besides this she had much to fear from her father who was as cruel as he was mighty and had caused the death already of many lovers who had wished to marry her. no no cried the prince. if only you will promise to do exactly as i tell you i think i may be able to save you and perhaps even become your wife. i am the youngest of a large family and my fathers favourite. i will go and tell him that a great and mighty prince hearing of his wonderful gifts has come to our land to ask for an interview with him. then i will tell him that i have seen you fallen in love with you and want to marry you. i will lead you to his presence and leave you with him alone. if you really love me you will find the way to win his consent but you must keep out of his sight till i have prepared the way for you. steps cut in the inside of the trunk led down to a wide space underground and there the magicians daughter told her lover to wait for her return. as i was gathering herbs in the forest i met a man i had never seen before a tall handsome young fellow looking like a prince who told me he was seeking the palace of a great and wonderful magician of whose marvellous deeds he had heard. she found her lover anxiously awaiting her and quickly explained how matters stood. if only you could get him to like you and want to keep you with him it would help us very much. so he at once went with her to the palace. on every side he saw signs of the strength and power of the magician. he knew full well that if he had tried to pass alone they would have prevented him from doing so. at last the two came to the great hall where the magician was walking backwards and forwards working himself into a rage at being kept waiting. he was too cunning to let sringabhuja guess that he knew him and pretended to be very glad to see him. she guessed however that her father had some evil purpose in what he said and looked earnestly at sringabhuja in the hope of making him understand. cried the magician and he clapped his hands together. my father will bid you choose your bride from amongst us and if you make a mistake all will be over for us. but i will wear my necklace on my head instead of round my neck and thus will you know your own true love. she waited quietly beside her lover till the magician bade all the sisters but herself leave the hall. great was the dismay of sringabhuja when he heard this. so he was about to begin to guide the oxen across the field when behold all was suddenly changed. this time sringabhuja felt no fear or hesitation for he was sure of the power and will to help him of his promised bride. come without delay when sringabhuja left the palace he knew not where to seek a horse to bear him on this new errand. you must go straight to the temple and when you have called out your message turn without a moments delay and ride for your life as swiftly as your steed will go looking behind you all the time. the next moment the magician was close upon him. whether his enemy ever got back to his temple sringabhuja never knew. if i ever am your wife he will try to punish you through me. but have no fear i shall know how to manage him. you have not bid my brother to the wedding. and he quietly turned his horse round and rode slowly home again. for when he got back to his palace and the servants hastened out to take his horse he guessed that a trick had been played on him. yes they shall suffer for it. this was altogether too much for the magician who became sure that there was something very wrong about him. when the news was brought to him that two strangers a handsome young man and a beautiful woman who appeared to be husband and wife had entered his capital he hastened forth to meet them hoping that perhaps they could give him news of sringabhuja. great was the rejoicing over sringabhujas return and hearty was the welcome given to his beautiful bride who quickly won all hearts but those of the wicked wives and sons who had tried to harm her husband and his mother. they feared the anger of the king when he found out how they had deceived him and they were right to fear. she could not be quite happy till her beloved husband said he knew she had never loved any one but him. his brothers however never ceased to hate him and when he came to the throne they gave him a great deal of trouble. he would never listen to a word of explanation or own that he had been mistaken even when he knew full well that he was in the wrong. it turned out that he was right. the guards were at first afraid to touch the vizier remembering how others had been punished for only speaking against him. the guards were relieved to find they need not drag the vizier away for they admired his courage and felt sure that the raja would soon find he could not get on without him. it might go hardly with them if he suffered harm at their hands. in his heart however he knew full well that it would need all his skill to escape with his life. she guessed at once that something had gone wrong and set forth to try and find out what had happened. do not for one moment suppose that i am in despair. now listen to me. and so on. but her husband checked her. it took her a good while to choose the beetle. exactly at the time fixed the faithful wife appeared at the foot of the tower with all the things she had been told to bring with her. she whispered as she gazed up through the darkness. first of all tie the end of the silken thread round the middle of the beetle leaving all its legs quite free. she obeyed fully understanding now what all these preparations were for. it had done its duty well and he would not throw it away. the rest of the day he spent quietly in his own home with his wife keeping out of sight of his servants lest they should report his return to his master. all this time the raja was feeling very unhappy for he thought he had himself caused the death of the one man he could trust. what then was his relief and surprise when a message was brought to him that the vizier was at the door of the palace and begged for an interview. the attendants looked on eager to know how he had got down from the tower some of them anything but glad to see him back. he grew richer and richer but he was never really happy again remembering the lie he had told to the master to whom he owed so much. she kept her promise never to tell anyone what really happened but the secret came out for all that. his wife was dead and all his children were getting their own living so he had nothing to do but to look after himself. he led a very easy existence but took a great interest in the affairs of his neighbours. then he hid himself behind the trunk of the tree from which the crow was watching evidently intending to stop there and see what would happen. he was quite right and it was not long before just what he expected came to pass. alas their joy was short lived the crow and the man behind the tree kept very quiet watching them the man with his stick ready to beat the poor helpless birds to death the crow watching out of mere curiosity. now a very strange and wonderful thing came to pass. he stood gazing up after his vanished net for a little time and then went away muttering to himself whilst the wise old crow laughed at him. he very soon learnt the reason and got so excited watching what was going on that he hopped out of his nest and perched upon a branch where he could see better. thought the crow. i have no wish to be your friend. never would i harm you at least give me a trial. so the two at once began their meal and before it was over they had become good friends. not a day passed without a meeting and when all the rice was eaten up each of the two would bring something to the feast. i am rather tired of this bit of the forest every inch of which we both know well. i should like to introduce you to him. i cant walk for miles and miles. after flying along for several hours the crow began to feel very tired. he was seized too with a great desire to hear his own voice again. the three had a long talk together and agreed never to part again. look how different it is for me it is almost impossible for any of the wild creatures who live near this river to hurt me and they know it full well. strange to say the hunters did not follow the deer and it was evident that they had not noticed the way he had gone. the tortoise the crow and the mouse were all very sorry for the deer and as was always the case the crow was the first to speak. he asked. when you have had a good meal and a drink from the river you will feel a different creature. the deer was so touched by the kind way in which he had been received that he agreed to stop with the three friends and for some weeks after his arrival all went well. the crow always had the most to say and was very useful to the deer in warning him of the presence of hunters in the forest. one beautiful moonlight night the deer did not come back as usual and the other three became very anxious about him. the crow flew up to the highest tree near and eagerly sought for some sign of his lost friend of whom he had grown very fond. he praised the mouse and declared that he would never again look down upon him. great was his rage when he found the net lying on the ground but not exactly where he had left it. he guessed at once that some animal had been caught in it and escaped after a long struggle. so he suspected just what had happened and began to search about for any creature who could have done the mischief. when the tortoise in his turn did not come home the deer the crow and the mouse were very much concerned. they talked the matter over together and decided that however great the risk to themselves they must go back and see what had become of their friend. once more the little mouse showed his wisdom. the hunter rushed after him and the two were soon out of sight. that evening the four friends met once more and talked over all they had gone through together. he is small and weak it is true but he has better brains than any of the rest of us and i for one admire him with all my heart. they once more agreed never to part and lived happily together for many years as they had done ever since they first met. a certain man named harisarman who lived in a little village in india where there were no rich people and everyone had to work hard to get his daily bread got very weary of the life he had to lead. unfortunately he was not a bit industrious but very lazy and so was his wife. neither of them made any attempt to teach their boys and girls to earn their own living and if the other poor people in the village had not helped them they would have starved. in course of time they came to a big town and harisarman went boldly to the chief house in it leaving his wife and children outside. he asked to see the master and was taken into his presence. he said that he would find work for him and his wife and that the children could be sent to a farm he had in the country where they could be made very useful. she became in fact quite a different creature and began to wish she had been a better mother to her children. on the other hand she forgot all about her husband and scarcely ever saw him. it was all very different with harisarman himself. he had no special duties to perform and nobody seemed to want him. if he went into the kitchen the busy servants ordered him to get out of their way and he was not made welcome by the owner of the house or his guests. the merchant too forgot all about him and he felt very lonely and miserable. all of a sudden an idea came into his head. now what can i take that is sure to be missed this was what harisarman decided to do. ah ah what a clever fellow i am it turned out that he was right. he took the beautiful creature far into the depths of the forest tied her up there and got safely back to his own room without being seen. but to her surprise harisarman refused to go back with her. she had to go back and tell the merchant that he would not come. i have treated him badly. she could not understand him and wished she had not left him to himself for so long. harisarman now thought it was time to take a different tone. so he put his hand in his pocket and brought out a map he had got ready whilst waiting to be sent for as he had felt sure he would be. his wife of course thought he would forgive her now for having neglected him. all went well with harisarman for a long time. but presently something happened which seemed likely to get him into very great trouble. poor harisarman did not know what to say or do. hearing this harisarman though more terrified than ever saw that his only chance of gaining time to make up some story was to get the king to believe in him. and turning to the guards he ordered them to take harisarman to prison and shut him up there without food or drink till he came to his senses. the man was dragged away and very soon he found himself alone in a dark and gloomy room from which he saw no hope of escape. he was in despair and walked up and down trying in vain to think of some way of escape. he tried the bars of the window but they were very strong he could not hope to move them. and he beat against the door but no notice was taken of that. when it got quite dark in the prison harisarman began to talk to himself aloud. it is all my foolish tongue which has got me into this trouble. tongue now a very strange thing happened. why didst thou behave in such a foolish manner just for the sake of the good things of this life not to tell the king what she had done. the man hesitated at first but in the end she persuaded him to consent by promising him a large reward. but he soon realized that it was a stranger. even now harisarman pretended to be unwilling to speak. and there sure enough deep down in the ground was all that had been lost. they sent for the man who had been on guard at the prison and asked him many questions. he might easily have found out where the treasure was hidden without any special power. never can i find out what is in it. the king was delighted to find that after all he had made no mistake and all the people who had been allowed to come in to see the trial were greatly excited. shouting for joy the king called harisarman to come to the foot of the throne and told him he would never never doubt him again. nobody was more surprised than harisarman himself. he guessed of course that there was a frog in the pitcher. his request was of course granted and he went off with the pitcher under his arm full of rejoicing over his narrow escape. at the same time he was also full of fear for the future. before they came from the farm their father had disappeared and nobody ever found out what had become of him but the king let his family keep what had been given to him and to the end believed he really had been what he had pretended to be. they loved her and she loved them. the birds were so tame that they would eat out of her hand and the deer used to follow her about in the hope of getting the bread she carried in her pocket for them. her father taught her all she knew and that was a great deal for she could read quite learned books in the ancient language of her native land. she was just as happy as the day was long and never wished for any change. but when she was about sixteen something happened which quite altered her whole life. one day her father had gone into the forest to cut wood and had left her alone. he looked at her without speaking and she looked back at him with her big black eyes full of surprise at his sudden appearance. he had been hunting and had got separated from his attendants. jumping up she ran to meet him glad that he had come for she had never before seen a young man and was as shy as any of the wild creatures of the woods. asked the king. it is a great honour for his little girl to be chosen by the king for his bride. but when she reached the door of her home she looked back and knew in her heart that she already loved the king and did not want him to go away. it did not take long for the matter of the marriage to be settled. she learnt to love him so much that she became as eager as he was for the wedding to be soon. now amongst these ladies was a very wise woman who could see what was going to happen and she knew that there would be troubles for the young queen in the palace because many would be jealous of her happiness. she was so happy she could not believe she would want to come home again so soon. but for all that she took the packet of seeds and hid it in her dress. after the wedding was over the king mounted his beautiful horse and bending down took his young wife up before him. the king spent many hours a day with her and was never tired of listening to all she had to tell him about her life in the forest with her father. every day he gave her some fresh proof of his love and he never refused to do anything she asked him to do. but presently a change came. she asked first one powerful person and then another to help her but everybody loved the queen and the wicked woman began to be afraid that those she had told about her wish to harm her would warn the king. she went to this woman one night and told her a long story in which there was not one word of truth. the young queen she said did not really love the king and with the help of her father who was a magician she meant to poison him. but she loved money very much. the wicked woman promised all this at once. but be very careful to give some proof of your story. at last an idea came into her head. she knew that the queen loved to wander in the forest and that she was not afraid of the wild creatures but seemed to understand their language. but he too liked money very much and in the end he promised to see what he could do if he was well paid for it. he was as the wicked woman had said clever enough and he knew from long experience just how to talk to his master. then he went on to say that it was easy to see that the lady was as clever as she was beautiful for she knew not only all about animals but also about plants. the king listened and a tiny little doubt crept into his mind about his wife. my father taught me. the wicked man was delighted and made up a long story. he said one of the waiting women had told him of what she had seen. the woman he said had followed the lady home one day and that home was not far from the palace. he remembered that he really did not know who she was or who her father was. he had loved her directly he saw her just because she was so beautiful. what was he to do now he would watch her himself in future and say nothing to her that would make her think he was doing so. the first thing she noticed was that one of the ladies of the court always followed her when she went into the forest. she did not like this because she so dearly loved to be alone with the wild creatures and they did not come to her when any one else was near. she told the lady to go away and she pretended to do so but she only kept a little further off. and though the queen could no longer see her she knew she was there and so did the birds and the deer. there are wild beasts in the depths of the wood who might hurt you. all would perhaps have been well even now if he had told her of the story he had heard about her because then she could have proved that it was not true. why not be content with the lovely gardens all round the palace for no birds or animals would come near me if one of their enemies were with me. the queen went away very sadly wondering to herself what she could do to prove to her dear lord that she loved him as much as ever. she took care never to go outside the palace gardens but she longed very much for her old freedom and began to grow pale and thin. presently the king too woke up and finding that his wife was no longer beside him he became very uneasy and was about to go and seek her when she came back. he asked her where she had been and she told him exactly what had happened but she did not explain why she could not sleep. he hurried to his wifes private room but she was not there and her ladies told him she had not been seen by them that day. this troubled him terribly and he roused the whole palace to seek her. he would neither eat nor drink and he ordered all the ladies whose duty it was to wait on the queen to be locked up till she was found. so she determined to go to him. you know not dear child i have never wished you to know that i am a magician and can make the very beasts of the field and the winds of heaven obey me. as for the third person in the plot the old witch of the cave not a word was said about her by anybody. i hope you will never again listen to stories against your wife. later when the queen had some children of her own their greatest treat was to go to the little home in the depths of the wood. a mouse call the cat the continual noise upstairs made him so nervous that he dropped a plate. his appetite failed he felt faint. would you rather go to bed the sofa pillow had a hole in it. but the sofa smelt of cat. it was just the same next day. he had nearly forgotten his visit to town. he started violently. but he did. one place suits one person another place suits another person. a busy little body was she one day the little red hen found a seed. carrying it about she made many inquiries as to what it might be. she found it was a wheat seed and that if planted it would grow up and when ripe it could be made into flour and then into bread. when she discovered that she knew it ought to be planted. she was so busy hunting food for herself and her family that naturally she thought she ought not to take time to plant it. and she did. and she did. poor little red hen she felt quite bewildered and hardly knew where to turn. and she did. and she did. there she ordered the wheat ground into beautiful white flour. so after her children were fed and made sweet and fresh for the day she hunted up the pig the cat and the rat. alas for the little red hen once more her hopes were dashed at last the great moment arrived. and she did. there they all sat round the fire busy with this thing and that. then the father went out to see what was the matter and when he got out of doors what should he see but a great big white bear. said the white bear. said the man. well the man would not be at all sorry to be so rich but still he thought he must have a bit of a talk with his daughter first so he went in and told them how there was a great white bear waiting outside who had given his word to make them so rich if he could only have the youngest daughter. meantime he talked his daughter over and kept on telling her of all the riches they would get and how well off she would be herself and so at last she thought better of it and washed and mended her rags made herself as smart as she could and was ready to start. so she rode a long long way till they came to a great steep hill. there on the face of it the white bear gave a knock and a door opened and they came into a castle where there were many rooms all lit up rooms gleaming with silver and gold and there too was a table ready laid and it was all as grand as grand could be. then the white bear gave her a silver bell and when she wanted anything she was only to ring it and she would get it at once. all that was in the room was gold or silver but when she had gone to bed and put out the light a man came and laid himself alongside her. so things went on happily for a while but at last she began to get silent and sorrowful for there she went about all day alone and she longed to go home to see her father and mother and brothers and sisters. so one sunday the white bear came and said now they could set off to see her father and mother. well off they started she sitting on his back and they went far and long. at last they came to a grand house and there her brothers and sisters were running about out of doors at play and everything was so pretty twas a joy to see. then when she went in to see her father and mother there was such joy there was no end to it. none of them thought they could thank her enough for all she had done for them. now they had everything they wished as good as good could be and they all wanted to know how she got on where she lived. well she said it was very good to live where she did she had all she wished. what she said beside i dont know but i dont think any of them had the right end of the stick or that they got much out of her. but so in the afternoon after they had done dinner all happened as the white bear had said. she said and put her mother off. but somehow or other her mother got round her at last and she had to tell her the whole story. but now ill teach you a lesson how to set eyes on him. yes she took the candle and hid it in her bosom and as night drew on the white bear came and fetched her away. but when they had gone a bit of the way the white bear asked if all hadnt happened as he had said. so when she reached home and had gone to bed it was the old story over again. for i have a stepmother who has bewitched me so that i am a white bear by day and a man by night. she wept and took it ill but there was no help for it go he must. then she asked if she mightnt go with him. no she mightnt. under it sat an old hag and played with a gold apple which she tossed about. yes she was. said the old hag. here the lassie asked if she knew the way to the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon and she answered like the first old hag that she knew nothing about it except it was east of the sun and west of the moon. her too she asked if she knew the way to the prince and where the castle was that lay east of the sun and west of the moon. so it was the same thing over again. said the old hag. yes it was. but she too didnt know the way a bit better than the other two. then on she rode many many days a weary time before she got to the east winds house but at last she did reach it and then she asked the east wind if he could tell her the way to the prince who dwelt east of the sun and west of the moon. yes the east wind had often heard tell of it the prince and the castle but he couldnt tell the way for he had never blown so far. so when they got there they went into the west winds house and the east wind said the lassie he had brought was the one who ought to have had the prince who lived in the castle east of the sun and west of the moon and so she had set out to seek him and how he had come with her and would be glad to know if the west wind knew how to get to the castle. maybe hell tell you. yes she got on his back and so they travelled to the south wind and werent so very long on the way i should think. when they got there the west wind asked him if he could tell her the way to the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon for it was she who ought to have had the prince who lived there. said the south wind. yes she got on his back and away he went from his house at a fine rate. and this time too she wasnt long on her way. yes said the north wind. she wasnt. but they werent very far from land and the north wind had still so much strength left in him that he managed to throw her up on the shore under the windows of the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon but then he was so weak and worn out he had to stay there and rest many days before he could get home again. yes she might that could be done. next morning as soon as day broke came the princess with the long nose and drove her out again. the princess asked what she wanted for it and she said it wasnt for sale for gold or money but if she might get leave to go up to the prince and be with him that night the princess should have it. but when she went up she found him fast asleep again and all she called and all she shook and wept and prayed she couldnt get life into him and as soon as the first gray peep of day came then came the princess with the long nose and chased her out again. so she threw up the window and asked what she wanted for it. the lassie said as she had said twice before it wasnt for sale for gold or money but if she might go up to the prince who was there and be with him alone that night she might have it. yes she might do that and welcome. but now you must know there were some christian folk who had been carried off thither and as they sat in their room which was next the prince they had heard how a woman had been in there and wept and prayed and called to him two nights running and they told that to the prince. that evening when the princess came with her sleepy drink the prince made as if he drank but threw it over his shoulder for he could guess it was a sleepy drink. so when the lassie came in she found the prince wide awake and then she told him the whole story how she had come thither. so there was great joy and love between them all that night. said the stepmother with all her heart. he shouted. well in she came. said he. she had a little lad with her and when she had got her bag full she struck across the hills towards her own home. but the lad was a long time gone for as soon as he got so far into the wood that the old dame could not see him he ran off to where the belt lay took it up tied it round his waist and lo he felt as strong as if he could lift the whole hill. when he got back the old dame was in a great rage and wanted to know what he had been doing all that while. yes he might do that so when he had got to the top he saw a light shining from the north. so he ran down and told his mother. dont you see that we are close to a house but they went on and in a little while they came to a great house which was all painted red. said the old dame. said the lad. then the lad sat down by the mans side and began to talk to him as if they had been old friends. so the lad went and took hold of the old dame and dragged her up the hall along the floor. after a while the lad asked if they could spend the night there. so they went on talking again but the lad soon got hungry and wanted to know if they could get food as well as lodging. this made the old hag still more afraid. said the old dame. in a little while back came the man with an ox so fat and big the lad had never seen its like and he gave it one blow with his fist under the ear and down it fell dead on the floor. after that he went to a cupboard and took out a great silver dish and laid the ox on it and the dish was so big that none of the ox hung over on any side. this he put on the table and then he went down into the cellar and fetched a cask of wine knocked out the head and put the cask on the table together with two knives which were each six feet long. when this was done he bade them go and sit down to supper and eat. as for the old dame she had to follow the man who showed her to bed though she was out of her wits for fear. said she. all this the lad lay and listened to. when the night wore on the troll began to talk to the old dame again and to wonder how ever they could be rid of the lad. so the old dame said it would be easy enough to get him there. all that the lad lay and listened to and when he got up in the morning his mother said she was worse than she looked and she thought she should never be right again unless she could get some lions milk. but the troll as he lay in bed swore it was all a lie. he was sure the lad was not the man to milk lions. when the lad heard that he forced the troll to get out of bed threw open the door and all the lions rose up and seized the troll and at last the lad had to make them leave their hold. that night the troll began to talk to the old dame again. all this the lad lay and listened to. oh the lad was ready to go that instant but the eleven lions went with him. the third day came the trolls brothers but they did not come in mans shape. the lad did not wake till late in the afternoon and when he got on his knees and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes he began to wonder what had been going on when he saw the marks of hoofs. i lose my life so she begged him to come in that she might talk with him for she hadnt seen a christian soul ever since she came there. but when she opened the door the lions wanted to go in too but she got so frightened that she began to scream and so the lad let them lie outside. she never wished it she said twas quite against her will. so they talked on and at last she asked him what he would do whether she should go back home or whether he would have her to wife. of course he would have her and she shouldnt go home. said the lad. after he had thus got down he thrust the sword under his arm and carried it about with him. so when they had lived a little while in the castle the princess thought she ought to go home to her parents and let them know what had become of her so they loaded a ship and she set sail from the castle. so he went and found both the man and his mother quite fresh and hearty. well they were both ready to go and on the way his mother talked to him and asked how it was he had got so strong. asked she. it was tied round his waist. then she seized it with both hands tore it off and twisted it round her fist. when it came out of the spring it saw its way quite plain and so saved its life. thought the lion and went and dragged the lad to the spring and dipped him over head and ears in it. so he crept softly in across the floor for there was no one there but as soon as he had got hold of the belt he began to kick and stamp about as though he were mad. now the lad was all alone and he went about longing and longing for the princess at last he could bear it no longer he must set out to seek her his heart was so bent on having her. so they began to knock it about with large stones but after all they couldnt crack the shell. then the lad came up with his sword to see what all the noise was about and when he saw the egg he thought it a trifle to crack it so he gave it one blow and the egg split and out came a chicken as big as an elephant. yes in a little while came a great bird flying with an island in its claws and let it fall down on the fleet and sunk every ship. so a messenger came to say the bear must come to the castle at once for the king wanted to see its tricks. so when it got to the castle every one was afraid for such a beast they had never seen before but the captain said there was no danger unless they laughed at it. they mustnt do that else it would tear them to pieces. when the king heard that he warned all the court not to laugh. when the show was over it was late at night. but at midnight the king came with a lamp in his hand and a big bunch of keys and carried off the white bear. there he kept his daughter for she was so dear to him that he had hid her so that no one could find her out. she said she was afraid and dared not look at it but he talked her over saying there was no danger if she only wouldnt laugh. so they brought the bear in and locked the door and it danced and played its tricks but just when the fun was at its height the princesss maid began to laugh. ill get you just as good a one again. but just then the bear curled himself up and lay down by the stove and it was settled at last that the princess should sleep there too with a light burning. but the lad would not hear of it he would earn her once more he said. the king asked. when they got up to the castle again the captain took the bear and led it away and then the lad threw off the hide and went to a tailor and ordered clothes fit for a prince and when they were fitted on he went to the king and said he wanted to find the princess. yes the lad knew all that. and so he went on dancing till there was only one hour left. then he said he would begin to search. at last he said he hadnt any key. they were exceedingly happy all but for one thing they had no children. and this often made them both sad because the queen wanted a dear little child to play with and the king wanted an heir to the kingdom. one day the queen went out for a walk by herself and she met an ugly old woman. listen. if you eat the red rose a little boy will be born to you if you eat the white rose a little girl will be sent. but whatever you do you mustnt eat both the roses or youll be sorry that i warn you and she wanted to give the old woman her gold ring but the old woman wouldnt take it. she was surprised for indeed she had hardly expected to see anything. but there were the two roses underneath it one red and one white. and now she was dreadfully puzzled for she did not know which to choose. but if i choose the white one and have a little girl she will stay at home awhile with us but later on she will get married and go away and leave us. however at last she decided on the white rose and she ate it. and it tasted so sweet that she took and ate the red one too without ever remembering the old womans solemn warning. the baby prince was so beautiful and so healthy the queen was full of joy and likewise as you may suppose was the king when he came home and found his son and heir. many days and years passed by and the baby grew up into a handsome young prince and it was time that he got married. then the prince made the coach turn round and try another road but it was all no use. for he was really the eldest of her twins and so he ought to have a wedding first. so the king wrote to a distant country and asked for a princess to marry his son but of course he didnt say which son and presently a princess arrived. but she wasnt allowed to see her bridegroom until he stood by her side in the great hall and was married to her and then of course it was too late for her to say she wouldnt have him. but next morning the princess had disappeared. and off he drove in the royal chariot with the six white horses. so the carriage tried another road and the same thing happened and they had to turn back again this time just as formerly. and the king wrote to several foreign countries to know if anyone would marry his son. at last another princess arrived this time from a very far distant land. and of course she was not allowed to see her future husband before the wedding took place and then lo and behold now down in a little cottage near a wood there lived the kings shepherd an old man with his only daughter. she is my only child and i want her to take care of me when i am old. he has already married two beautiful princesses and devoured them and he will eat me too so the girl said she would. said he. said she. but the girl was not afraid and once more she commanded him to do as she bade. and she fell fast asleep that very moment. they wanted to know what had become of the girl but none of them dared enter the room. no bride was ever so beloved by a king and queen as this peasant maid from the shepherds cottage. the lassie and her godmother 
once on a time a poor couple lived far far away in a great wood. and again as he went home towards evening the same lovely lady met him who looked so sweet and good and she made him the same offer. out flew a star. out flew the moon. but the lassie wept so bitterly and prayed so heartily for forgiveness that this time too she got leave to stay. out flew the sun. so she became all at once wondrous fair but from that day forth she was dumb. close by lay a castle and from that castle came early every morning a maid to draw water to make the princes tea from the spring over which the lassie was sitting. so another maid had to go for the water but the same thing happened to her she went back and said she was far too pretty and too good to fetch water from the spring for the prince. then the prince went himself for he had a mind to see what all this could mean. but the prince could not be content till he got her. but when those who were on the watch woke they thought the queen had eaten her own child and the old queen was all for burning her alive but the prince was so fond of her that at last he begged her off but he had hard work to set her free. and now the old queen said she must be burnt but the prince found means to beg her off. but when the third child was to be born a watch was set three times as strong as the first but just the same thing happened. and now the prince could not save her any longer. she must and should be burnt. how glad the queen and prince now were all may easily think but no one can tell. after that they were always happy and from that day even the princes mother was very fond of the young queen. yes the husband thought that would do very well. he was quite willing he said. so he got up on the house to tie her up. at last she thought shed waited long enough and went home. but as she did this down came her husband out of the chimney and so when his old dame came inside the kitchen there she found him standing on his head in the porridge pot. at this the lad got very angry and as he thought it hard that the north wind should behave so he thought hed just look him up and ask him to give up his meal. so off he went but the way was long and he walked and walked but at last he came to the north winds house. with this the lad was well content. so when the lad woke he took his cloth and went off with it and that day he got home to his mother. but never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve up. so he came to where the north wind lived late in the afternoon. said the lad. said the north wind. so the lad thought this a fine thing but as it was too far to get home that day he turned in for the night to the same inn where he had slept before. said the lad but if the ram made anything it wasnt money. so the lad went back again to the north wind and blew him up and said the ram was worth nothing and he must have his rights for the meal. lay on oh my then he took the cloth and put it into his pocket and went home with his stick in his hand leading the ram by a cord round its horns and so he got his rights for the meal he had lost. one day when he was out fishing he just caught nothing. after that as was like enough he caught plenty of fish of all kinds. well the story soon spread and came up to the castle and when the king heard the womans grief and its cause he sent down to say he would take care of the child and see if he couldnt save it. so the months went on and on and when her time came the fishers wife had a boy so the king took it at once and brought it up as his own son until the lad grew up. then he begged leave one day to go out fishing with his father he had such a mind to go he said. at first the king wouldnt hear of it but at last the lad had his way and went. so he and his father were out the whole day and all went right and well till they landed at night. there he went ashore and when he had walked about a bit an old old man met him with a long white beard. asked the lad. so the lad told him all. in the same way he passed by the second but to the third he went straight up. well the lad said he was ready to try. then go straight on into a little dark room and make your bed. yes he did as the princess told him he passed in the midst between the lions as if he hadnt seen them and went straight into the little room and there he lay down to sleep. so he took the youngest for his queen and lived well and happily with her for some time. at last he began to long to go home for a little to see his parents. then she gave him a ring which was of that kind that any one who wore it might wish two wishes. so he wished himself home and when he got home his parents could not wonder enough what a grand man their son had become. now when he had been at home some days his mother wished him to go up to the palace and show the king what a fine fellow he had come to be. but it was no good the mother begged and prayed so long that at last he went. and that instant there she stood before them. then the young king was cut to the heart and went day out day in thinking and thinking how he should get back to his queen. but there was no beast that knew. ask him. so when the king reached the house he turned the shoes as the lord of the beasts had said and away they went home of themselves. now long long after the rest of the birds came an old eagle which had been away ten round years but he couldnt tell any more than the rest. the king was full of thanks got on the shoes and when he came to the man who was lord over the fish of the sea he turned the toes round and so off they went home like the other pair. so the man called the fish with a blast but no fish could tell where it lay. at last came an old pike which they had great work to call home he was such a way off. i should think i did yes the king thanked the man and went and did as he told him. he said to the brothers. so as he went along up in the air he came up with the north wind. roared the north wind. well the king did as the north wind said. yes halvor would like that very much so he wasnt long in getting himself ready. how long they sailed im sure i cant tell but the end of it was they fell into a great storm and when it was blown over and it got still again they couldnt tell where they were for they had been driven away to a strange coast which none of them knew anything about. but halvor stuck to his own and so at last he got leave but he was to be sure and come back as soon as ever it began to blow. well it began to blow but halvor thought he hadnt seen enough yet and he wanted to walk a little farther just to see if he couldnt meet any folk. so after a while he came to a broad high road so smooth and even you might easily roll an egg along it. so as he had now walked the whole day and hadnt taken a bit to eat with him he was as hungry as a hunter but still the nearer he came to the castle the more afraid he got. in the castle kitchen a great fire was blazing and halvor went into it but such a kitchen he had never seen in all his born days. it was so grand and fine there were vessels of silver and vessels of gold but still never a living soul. as for going i wont go at all. halvor jumped behind the door. asked halvor. well she told him all about it one was taken away by a troll to his castle which lay fifty miles off and the other by another troll to his castle which was fifty miles further still. so they had a good and happy time of it and next morning he set off at peep of grey dawn he could take no rest by the way but ran and walked the whole day. so halvor went into the kitchen and didnt stop there either but went straight further on into the house. i dont know im sure how long it is since i came here but in all that time i havent seen a christian man. but it was no good halvor wouldnt go he wasnt at all afraid of the troll but meat and drink he must have for he was half starved after his long journey. well he got as much of that as he wished but then the princess wanted him to be off again. just then back came the troll and he was both stout and big so that he had to go sideways to get through the door. this time he wasnt the least afraid but walked straight through the kitchen and into the castle. she too like the others told him there hadnt been christian folk there ever since she came thither and bade him go away again else the troll would swallow him alive and do you know she said he has nine heads. but there after a while halvor went about and was so strange and dull and silent. yes he did for they had enough and to spare and he was well off in every way but still somehow or other he did so long to go home for his father and mother were alive and them he had such a great wish to see. well they thought that might be done easily enough. yes hed be sure to mind all they said. then stood halvor at his fathers cottage door before he knew a word about it. then halvor asked if he couldnt stay there and have a lodging there that night. no that he couldnt. halvor wouldnt hear of it he wanted to stop but the old couple stuck to their own that he had better go to the farmers there he would get both meat and drink as for them they hadnt even a chair to offer him to sit down on. yes yes they had once a lad whose name was halvor but they didnt know whither he had wandered they couldnt even tell whether he were dead or alive. said halvor. and off she went first and halvor followed after. he had scarce uttered these words before there they stood but then he felt so sorry for now what they had said came into his mind. up at the farm there was a great feast got ready for the princesses and much was made of them but they wouldnt stop there. so he went down with them and they came to a great lake just outside the farm. close by the water was such a lovely green bank here the princesses said they would sit and rest a while they thought it so sweet to sit down and look over the water. in spite of all his father and mother said he wouldnt stop there but took farewell of them and said he was safe not to see them again for if he couldnt find the princesses again he thought it not worth while to live. well he had still about sixty pounds left so he put them into his pocket and set out on his way. asked halvor. at last they agreed on the price and halvor laid the knapsack on him and so he walked a bit and rode a bit turn and turn about. at night he came to a green plain where stood a great tree at the roots of which he sat down. there he let the horse loose but he didnt lie down to sleep but opened his knapsack and took a meal. at peep of day off he set again for he could take no rest. so he went on walking and riding by turns and as for the wood there seemed to be no end to it. but at dusk the next day he saw a light gleaming away through the trees. when he got up to it he saw the light came from a wretched little hut and through the window he saw an old old couple inside. as for halvor he had no rest and wanted to be off at once but the old wife said there was no hurry. out ran the old wife. out ran halvor. so off he set over field and hedge and hill and fell and halvor had hard work to keep up. then up rose the princess from the board at once. the giant who had no heart in his body 
once on a time there was a king who had seven sons and he loved them so much that he could never bear to be without them all at once but one must always be with him. so the king gave the six the finest clothes you ever set eyes on so fine that the light gleamed from them a long way off and each had his horse which cost many many hundred pounds and so they set off. now the king waited and waited for his six sons but the more he waited the longer they stayed away so he fell into great trouble and said he should never know what it was to be glad again. but boots had set his heart upon it go he would and he begged and prayed so long that the king was forced to let him go. so he gave the raven some of the food he had brought with him. so when the wolf had eaten the horse boots took the bit and put it into the wolfs jaw and laid the saddle on his back and now the wolf was so strong after what he had got inside that he set off with the prince like nothing. so after a while they came to it. well boots went in but truth to say he was very much afraid. when he came in the giant was away but in one of the rooms sat the princess just as the wolf had said and so lovely a princess boots had never yet set eyes on. heaven help you just creep under the bed yonder and mind and listen to what he and i talk about. so he crept under the bed and he had scarce got well underneath it before the giant came. so the giant said no more about it and when night came they went to bed. asked the giant. just as he was well under back came the giant. so the giant held his peace and said no more about it. said the giant. so when they went to bed again in the evening the princess asked the giant again where his heart was for she said she would so like to know. next morning the giant was away early and strode off to the wood and so soon as he was gone boots and the princess were in the cupboard hunting for his heart but the more they sought for it the less they found it. then back came the giant. who could it be but the princess asked the giant. said the giant. said the princess. in the morning early while it was still grey dawn the giant strode off to the wood. he took a long long farewell of the princess and when he got out of the giants door there stood the wolf waiting for him. so boots told him all that had happened inside the house and said now he wished to ride to the well in the church if he only knew the way. after they had travelled many many days they came at last to the lake. then the prince did not know how to get over it but the wolf bade him only not be afraid but stick on and so he jumped into the lake with the prince on his back and swam over to the island. so they came to the church but the church keys hung high high up on the top of the tower and at first the prince did not know how to get them down. but when he came to the well there lay the duck and swam about backwards and forwards just as the giant had said. then the wolf told him to squeeze the egg and as soon as ever he squeezed it the giant screamed out. so boots squeezed the egg to pieces and the giant burst at once. well the eldest son was ready to go and watch the meadow trust him for looking after the grass so he got on its back and rode off with it to a place which no one knew of and there he put up the horse. now when the third st. johns eve came the two elder brothers still hadnt the heart to lie out in the barn and watch the grass for they had got so scared at heart the nights they lay there before that they couldnt get over the fright but boots he dared to go and to make a very long story short the very same thing happened this time as had happened twice before. upon the tip top of the hill the kings daughter was to sit with three golden apples in her lap and the man who could ride up and carry off the three golden apples was to have half the kingdom and the princess to wife. now this princess was so lovely that all who set eyes on her fell over head and ears in love with her whether they would or no. but all were eager to have the princess and half the kingdom. so they rode and slipped and slipped and rode and still it was the same story over again. then all the others called out to him he might just as well spare himself the trouble of riding at the hill for it would lead to no good but he gave no heed to them and put his horse at the hill and went up it like nothing for a good way about a third of the height and when he had got so far he turned his horse round and rode down again. and when she saw him turning back she threw down one of the golden apples after him and it rolled down into his shoe. but when he got to the bottom of the hill he rode off so fast that no one could tell what had become of him. one after the other they all came but not a man of them could show the apple. at even the brothers of boots came home too and had such a long story to tell about the riding up the hill. he was a chap to ride just next day the brothers were all for setting off again and boots begged them this time too to let him go with them and see the riding but no they wouldnt have him at any price he was too ugly and nasty they said. so when the brothers got to the hill of glass all the princes and knights began to ride again and you may fancy they had taken care to shoe their horses sharp but it was no good they rode and slipped and slipped and rode just as they had done the day before and there was not one who could get so far as a yard up the hill. and when they had worn out their horses so that they could not stir a leg they were all forced to give it up as a bad job. to tell the truth the princess liked him still better than the knight in brass and she sat and wished he might only be able to come right up to the top and down the other side but when she saw him turning back she threw the second apple after him and it rolled down and fell into his shoe. but as soon as ever he had come down from the hill of glass he rode off so fast that no one could see what became of him. the third day everything happened as it had happened the two days before. boots begged to go and see the sight but the two wouldnt hear of his going with them. when they got to the hill there was no one who could get so much as a yard up it and now all waited for the knight in silver mail but they neither saw nor heard of him. the other knights and princes could not find time to call out to him not to try his luck for they were amazed to see how grand he was. so he rode right at the hill and tore up it like nothing so that the princess hadnt even time to wish that he might get up the whole way. as soon as ever he reached the top he took the third golden apple from the princess lap and then turned his horse and rode down again. as soon as he got down he rode off at full speed and was out of sight in no time. now when the brothers got home at even you may fancy what long stories they told how the riding had gone off that day and amongst other things they had a deal to say about the knight in golden mail. next day all the knights and princes were to pass before the king and the princess it was too late to do so the night before i suppose that he who had the gold apple might bring it forth but one came after another first the princes and then the knights and still no one could show the gold apple. so he commanded that every man who was in the kingdom should come up to the palace and see if they could show the apple. well they all came one after another but no one had the golden apple and after a long time the two brothers of boots came. they were the last of all so the king asked them if there was no one else in the kingdom who hadnt come. so boots had to go up to the palace. the widows son 
once on a time there was a poor poor widow who had an only son. so the lad wandered out into the world and when he had walked a day or so a strange man met him. asked the man. asked the man. said the man. so the lad stopped with him and lived on the fat of the land both in meat and drink and had little or nothing to do but he never saw a living soul in that mans house. well indeed and when it was over they were as good friends as ever. well it was the same story over again except that the lad stood out eight days before he went in. in this room too he saw nothing but a shelf over the door and a big stone and a pitcher of water on it. well after all theres not much to be afraid of my seeing here thought the lad. but when the man came back he asked if he had been into any of the rooms. no the lad hadnt done anything of the kind. but when he got sound and well again he led just as easy a life as ever and he and the man were just as good friends. it was gilded all over. after that the man took down a pot from the wall and rubbed him over with some stuff out of it and so the lad was as sound and fresh as ever. so after a while the man started off again and this time he was to be away a month. but before he went he said to the lad if he went into the fourth room he might give up all hope of saving his life. well the lad stood out for two or three weeks but then he couldnt hold out any longer he must and would go into that room and so in he stole. then the lad thought this all wrong so he changed them about and put the hay at his head. so the lad did all that but it was a heavy load for him to carry them all down at once. asked the horse. oh yes so when the lad had got on the horse off they went at such a rate he couldnt at all tell how they went. so they rode on a while until those who followed were close behind them. and as soon as the lad did what the horse said up rose a great black hill of rock behind him. so the troll had to be off home to fetch something to mine his way through the rock and while the troll did that the lad rode a good bit further on. so it became a great deep lake and because of that one drop the horse found himself far out in it but still he swam safe to land. yes the lad did all his horse told him and as soon as ever he put on the wig of moss he became so ugly and pale and miserable to look at no one would have known him again. off with it. but when the coachman begged him to take his wig off he got the same answer and he wouldnt have him either. so when he had been some time at the palace it happened one morning just as the sun rose that the lad had taken off his wig and stood and washed himself and then he was so handsome it was a joy to look at him. so the princess saw from her window the lovely gardeners boy and thought she had never seen any one so handsome. then she asked the gardener why he lay out there under the steps. so the gardener told that to the lad. said the lad. after that the lad slept every night in the princess bedroom. he didnt do that however but he threw him into the prison tower and as for his daughter he shut her up in her own room whence she never got leave to stir day or night. all that she begged and all that she prayed for the lad and herself was no good. and all the rest had their fun out of this and laughed and made game of the lad as they rode past him. the king and his men wondered and wondered who it could be who had come to help them but none of them got so near him as to be able to talk to him and as soon as the fight was over he was gone. when they went out to battle the third day the lad still sat there. and then they rode on and laughed at him till they were fit to fall from their horses. when the battle was over the king caught sight of his handkerchief which the strange warrior had bound round his leg and so it wasnt hard to find him out. so they took him with great joy between them to the palace and the princess who saw him from her window got so glad no one can believe it. so he got the princess to wife but when he went down into the stable where his horse was on the day the wedding was to be there it stood so dull and heavy and hung its ears down and wouldnt eat its corn. so the king had to do what he asked but when he swung the sword and was to cut his head off he was so sorry he turned away his face for he would not see the stroke fall. asked the king. he it was who threw this trolls shape over me and sold me to the troll. and they didnt either for they were friends as long as they lived and each paid the other very many visits. went the bridge. roared the troll. pray dont take me. trip trap went the bridge. roared the troll. trip trap roared the troll. the three princesses in the blue mountain 
there were once upon a time a king and queen who had no children and they took it so much to heart that they hardly ever had a happy moment. but he felt he could have no enjoyment out of it all since he did not know what would become of it after his time. when the time came the queen had a beautiful baby girl the year after she had another and the third year she also had a girl. the king and queen were glad beyond all measure but although the king was very happy he did not forget to set a watch at the palace door so that the princesses should not get out. as they grew up they became both fair and beautiful and all went well with them in every way. their only sorrow was that they were not allowed to go out and play like other children. the sun was shining and everything looked so green and beautiful that they felt that they must go out happen what might. well he didnt think it looked much like it either and if they must go they had better go the soldier said but it must only be for a minute and he himself would go with them and look after them. it was many times prettier than any they had gathered so they must have that also. you can well understand there were plenty who wanted to gain half the kingdom and a princess into the bargain so there were people of both high and low degree who set out for all parts of the country. the king fitted them out both with silver and gold and wished them success on their journey. then came a soldier who lived with his mother in a little cottage some way from the palace. and the next two nights the same thing happened he had the same dream and he felt he must go. yes that he might have if that was all he wanted. when they had gone awhile the soldier left the high road and took a path into the forest. he kept to the path and when the others saw this they turned round and followed him. but on that bridge a bear stood on guard. he rose on his hind legs and came towards them as if he wanted to eat them. said the captain. but when they reached the other end of the bridge they saw a lion which came roaring towards them with open jaws as if he wanted to swallow them. in the evening they came to a fine big house. they helped themselves of what he had as if they had never tasted food before. the next day the captain said they would have to go out shooting and try to get something to live upon. in the meantime the captain and the soldier shot so much game that they were hardly able to carry it home. said the captain. said the captain. in a little while the old man came in and asked for a penny. he let it fall as soon as he got it gone it was and could not be found. so he asked the captain to help him to find it and the captain without giving a thought bent down to look for it. when the others came home in the evening he still lay on the same spot and could neither see nor speak. the third day the soldier was to remain at home while the other two went out shooting. they were no sooner outside the door than the old man came in and asked for a penny again. the old man was not sufficiently cunning and did as he was told he lay down and looked steadily along the log. said the old man. under that there is a deep hole through which you must let yourself down and youll then come to another world where you will find the princesses. when the soldier got to know this he released the old man who was not long in making off. he told them what had happened from first to last where the princesses were and how they should find them. they then began to measure how deep it was they joined on ropes both two and three times but they were no nearer the bottom the last time than the first. at last they had to join all the ropes they had both the coarse and fine and then they found it reached the bottom. he found the way both dark and unpleasant but he thought he would go on as long as it became no worse. at last he discovered a gleam of light far far away like the dawn of day and he went on in that direction. when he had gone a bit it began to grow light around him and before long he saw a golden sun rising in the sky and everything around him became as bright and beautiful as if in a fairy world. he walked through many rooms without meeting anybody. said the princess. no it was too heavy he could not even move it. at last he took a right big draught and he could swing the sword as easily as anything. all at once the troll came home he walked so heavily that the palace shook. the soldier then stole into the room with the sword and with one blow cut all the three heads off the troll. first of all they went across a courtyard and then through many long rooms till they came to a big door. she said. first of all he had to try if he was able to swing the trolls sword which lay on the table it was much larger and heavier than the first one he was hardly able to move it. she was no less glad than her elder sister as you may imagine and danced and sang but in the midst of their joy they remembered their youngest sister. they went with the soldier across a large courtyard and after walking through many many rooms he came to the hall of gold where the third sister was. said the princess. the princess cried and wept but it was all of no use he must and would remain. since there was no help for it he would have to try if he could use the trolls sword on the table in the front hall. but he was only just able to move it it was still larger and heavier than the other two swords. the princess then settled with the soldier to do the same as her sisters had done. as soon as the troll was well asleep she would call the hens and he must then make haste and come in and put an end to the troll. just now a raven flew past here and dropped a human bone down the chimney. they then took with them as much gold and silver as they thought they could carry and set off on their way home. but when they were safely up the soldier thought it was foolish of him not to have gone up before the princesses for he had not very much belief in his comrades. he thought he would first try them so he put a heavy lump of gold in the basket and got out of the way. they were forced to agree to this much against their will and especially the youngest princess but life was precious and so the two who were strongest had their way. the king was so glad he didnt know which leg to stand on he brought out his best wine from his cupboard and wished the two officers welcome. they both wanted the youngest princess but for all they prayed and threatened her it was of no use she would not hear or listen to either. they then asked the king if they might have twelve men to watch over her she was so sad and melancholy since she had been in the mountain that they were afraid she might do something to herself. yes that they might have and the king himself told the watch they must look well after her and follow her wherever she went and stood. they asked. if he were their master the soldier said he would like to know if they could tell him how to get up to the earth again. so he asked her if she knew any means by which he could get away from the world in which they were. he did as she asked him and hung two large bags of meat round her neck and seated himself among her feathers. it was as much as the soldier could do to hold on and it was with the greatest difficulty he managed to throw the pieces of flesh into the eagles mouth every time she opened it. then she gained strength and brought him up to earth. close to the palace the soldier got off and the eagle flew home again but first she told him that if he at any time should want her he need only blow the whistle and she would be there at once. at last the king asked what was the matter with them he thought it was very strange that they were not merry and happy now that they were saved and had been set free and were going to be married. for all they tried there was no one who could make them. he asked. said the king. this he got and thanks into the bargain. but when the night came on the soldier opened the window and blew his whistle. the eagle then came and asked what he wanted. the soldier then put them under his bed and lay down to sleep. early next morning the goldsmith came and knocked at his door. asked the soldier. said he. she asked. and then she pulled off his cap and showed them the ring she had tied in his hair. but the soldier got the golden crown and half the kingdom and married the youngest princess. then the white bear rose up and growled and hunted the whole pack of them out of doors both great and small. among the forest people 

mr. red squirrel comes to live in the forest 
life in the forest is very different from life in the meadow and the forest people have many ways of doing which are not known in the world outside. they are a quiet people and do not often talk or sing when there are strangers near. then if you were to live among them and speak their language you would find that there are many things about which it is not polite to talk. and there is a reason for all this. it is not because they are cross or selfish or bad. it is just because of the way in which they have to live and hunt and they cannot help it any more than you could help having eyes of a certain color. when people are born there they learn these things without thinking about it but when they come there from some other place it is very hard for everybody thinks it stupid in strangers to ask about such simple matters. when mr. red squirrel first came to the forest he knew nothing of the way in which they do and he afterward said that learning forest manners was even harder than running away from his old home. you see mr. red squirrel was born in the forest but was carried away from there when he was only a baby. one day he saw another squirrel outside a dainty little one who looked as though she had never a sad thought. the next day mr. red squirrel pretended to be sick. he would not run in the wheel or taste the food in his cage. the window was up and when he saw his chance mr. red squirrel leaped into the open air and was away to the forest. his poor legs were weak from living in such a small cage but how he ran the forest was a new world to him and he asked many questions of a fat old gray squirrel. the gray squirrel was one of those people who know a great deal and think that they know a great great deal and want others to think so too. asked mr. red squirrel. asked mr. red squirrel. why because they are not in our set. and the gray squirrel sat up very straight indeed. we never speak to each other. you will get into trouble if you talk such things aloud. she cant help it. why all day long. so mr. red squirrel being a wise little fellow stopped asking and thought by using his eyes and ears he would in time learn all that he needed to know. he had a very happy life among the forest people and perhaps that was one reason. and after all you know it would have been very foolish to ask questions which nobody could answer and worse than foolish to ask about matters which he could find out for himself. it is in the forest as in the world outside. we can know that many things are but we never know why they are. indeed he is much the more powerful of the two for he is king of air and earth alike and can go wherever he wishes while the snake can only rule over those who live near the ground or who are so careless as to come to him there. they are such hungry fellows that they swallow their food with the bones in it. his whole body was covered with brown dull yellow and white feathers. his wife who was the queen of the forest at night looked exactly like him only she was larger than he. mrs. owl could not be gone very long at a time for there were two large round white eggs in the nest which must not get cold. her husband was on the wing most of the night and he often flew home with some tender morsel for her. i am so sorry for you. he was always proud of his children and he thought himself a very good husband. perhaps he was still he had never taken his place on the nest while his wife went hunting. one night after they had both been flying through forest and over field he came back to the hollow tree to rest. he expected to find mrs.
owl for she had started home before he did. she was not there and he grew quite impatient. after a while he looked into the nest and saw the two big white eggs. you see even then he did not seem to think that he could do anything to keep them warm. it fairly made his head feathers stand on end to think of it and he was so frightened that he forgot to be cross and stepped right in and covered them with his own breast. would mrs. owl ever forgive him for being so stupid he began to wonder if any of the other fellows would see him. the night seemed so long too. how he did laugh said he. i am very sorry for you. who who perhaps he hadnt been acting very well after all he knew that even when he told her he was sorry he had been thinking she made a great fuss. now if this were just a story one could say that mrs. owl came back and that they were all happy together but the truth is she never did come and nobody ever knew what became of her. he said. those who have been away have also much to say and it sometimes seems as though they were all talking at once. then he will want to hear the first part of it and make such a fuss that they have to tell it all over again just for him. he wanted to look so handsome that a certain miss crow a sister of one of his friends would like him better than she did any of the others. that was all very well if he had been at all polite about it. then he went away. each time it was a bigger story until at last he made them think that the other crow hadnt a tail feather left. the next day a number of crows went to a farm not far from the forest. miss crow was in the party. on their way they stopped in a field where there stood a figure of a man with a dreadful stick in his hand. everybody was frightened except mr. crow. he wanted to show how much courage he had so he flew right up to it. they all thought him very brave. they didnt know that down in his heart he was a great coward. he wasnt afraid of this figure because he knew all about it. he knew that instead of having two good legs with which to run this figure had only the end of a pole stuck into the ground. of course he might have told them all and then they could have gathered corn from the broken ground around but he didnt want to do that. and he looked tenderly at her with his little round eyes. he had heard from the hens how rude mr. crow had been and he thought that as the head of the house he ought to see about it. well the next morning mr. crow flew over the forest and far away. he did not want to go back there again. he heard voices as he passed a tall tree by the edge of the forest. miss crow was out with the crow whom he had beaten and they were looking for a good place in which to build. she hopped to one side of her nest and stood looking at the four white eggs that lay there. she did not even touch a piece of the shell until he was well out of it for she knew that it is always better for children to help themselves when they can. it makes them strong and fits them for life. and that would have been very sad for the babies. even if it had been whole once more he could not have been packed into it for he had been stretching and growing every minute since he left it. they were a young couple and this was their first child. but who can tell what the other three children who had not cracked the shell were thinking could they remember the time when they began to be could they think at all ah but they must leave it for they were healthy and growing and when they had done so they would forget all about it. that is why you can never get a bird to tell you what he thought about while in the egg. when they had their eyes open there was much to be seen. at least they thought so. was there not the hollow in their dear dry old tree a hollow four or five times as high as they could reach it was an exciting time when their feathers began to grow. now too the eldest of the family began to show a great fault. he was very vain. you can imagine how sorry his parents were. every morning when he awakened he looked first of all at his feathers. those on his breast were white and he had a white band on his wings. his head neck and throat were crimson. the sisters were getting their new suits at the same time and there was just as much reason why they should be vain but they were not. they were glad as who would not be he was not contented to let his feathers grow as the grass and the leaves grow without watching. no indeed he looked at each one every day and a great many times every day. then if he thought they were not growing as fast as they should he worried about it. he wanted to hurry them along and sometimes when his sisters did not seem to be looking he took hold of them with his bill and pulled. of course this did not make them grow any faster and it did make his skin very sore but how was he to know he had not been out of the shell long enough to be wise. it troubled him too because he could not see his red feathers. she looked out of the doorway as she spoke but he knew that she meant him. things went on in this way until the children were ready to fly. that is something many people would like to know but it is a forest secret and no bird will tell anyone who cannot fly. he was speaking of an old tree where he had spent the last winter. the father and mother are fine people and they have charming daughters but their son must be a great trial to them. this puzzled his father. said he. how his father did laugh if it were intended you should look at yourself all the time your eyes would have been one under your chin and the other in the back of your head. no he was wondering at that minute how his tail looked but he was determined not to turn his head. and he was as good as his word. his mother sighed when she heard of the change. if they were dressed in yellow or red any passing bird would see them and there is no telling what might happen. as it is their brown wings are so nearly the color of dead leaves or bark that you might often look right at them without seeing them. he cried. she had been thinking of that when she first spoke but she hoped he had forgotten. during the long winter she had regretted this. when i get my wings i may meet people who are better off than he. now i shall have to be polite to him for the sake of old friendship. those of her friend she was troubled to see were not what they should have been. one of them was all right the other was small and crooked. he did not mind it much. he thought about other things than looks. cried he. her friend flew over to her just as she raised her wings for flight. cried one of them as he alighted beside her. while they were fighting another of the strangers flew to her. he asked. said the stranger. oh oh you have a bad temper havent you he said. he asked as he felt of one of his wings now broken and bare. there are some people you know who can change their minds in such a sweet and easy way that we almost love them the better for it. they had done that once but it was long ago before she had laid an egg and while she was still quite young. they would say. sometimes lazy people eat even more than others and pick for the best too. they clung to the walls and to each other and made wax. it took much patience to make wax. the great trouble with them was that if you once began to talk they did not like to have you leave and go to work. it would not do for them to laugh at their brother. when one gave the signal they dashed out as nearly together as possible. what does he look like then they went about their work as usual. she said. the next morning they peeped out and then rushed away to the flowers for their breakfast. they stayed out all day and when they returned at night they rushed swiftly into the tree again. silly fellow at any rate there was no use in getting cross about it because that was something she would have to expect. she was a lazy creature in spite of her stirring ways and she wished to find a nice little nest in which to lay an egg. what an easy way this is to bring up ones family it is really no work at all and i am sure that my children will get along well because i am always careful to choose the nests of small birds for them. i did once and such a time as i had we will put another floor in our nest right over this egg and then by adding a bit all around the sides we can have plenty of room for our own children. they went to work once more and it was not so very long before the new floor was done and the new walls raised. then oh wonder of wonders she is not so very strong. how lucky i am to have such a bright wife it is nothing but a few twigs and sticks laid together. now of course the rabbit was mistaken when he said anybody had told him that those two eggs were broken just as much mistaken as the grouse was when she said somebody had told her that the eggs had fallen. they cried. your poor babies mrs. mourning dove looked from one to another as though she did not know what to make of it. then it was the turn of the other birds to be surprised. see him open his bill the dear and did you ever see such a neck as she has it was very kind of you to be so sorry for me when you heard i was in trouble. mr. mourning dove seems to think her perfect. that is the best thing that you can say about them. this always has been so and it always will be so. it is in the summer that they become bad neighbors. they are doing sly things and they do not want to be found out. the wee babies grow fast and their mouths are always open for more food. they visit the nests of their bird neighbors and then something very sad happens. and because he was the largest and the strongest he usually got it. sometimes too the first bite was so big that there was nothing left for anyone else to bite at. he was a very greedy fellow and he had no right to take more than his share just because he happened to be the first of the family to break open the shell or because he grew fast. after a while his chance came. one afternoon they went to a part of the forest where the ground was damp and all was strange. the father and mother told their children to keep close together and they would take care of them but the foolish young blue jay wanted a chance to go alone so he hid behind a tree until the others were far ahead and then he started off another way. he wondered if this one had a rattle and he made up his mind to see how it was fastened on. the young blue jay saw that his eyes were very bright. then the young blue jay tried to move and found that he couldnt. it was not a good season for a stranger who had no hidden store of nuts and seeds to draw upon. poor mr. red squirrel began to wish that he had eaten breakfast before he ran away. he said to himself and he was so much in earnest that he spoke quite loudly. but whoever it was did not mean to be caught and such a chase as he had he ran up and down the tree on which he last saw her and found a little hollow in one of its large branches. he looked in and there she was the same dainty creature whom he had so often watched from his cage. perhaps she now thought that she had been too bold in giving him food and so wanted him to think that it had been somebody else. said he. said she. he answered. he asked. he asked quickly. you may have some whenever you wish. she cried starting up. you should have seen mr. red squirrel then at him and made fun of him for being a stranger but they left at last and mr. red squirrel turned to his friend. she said. and he sighed again. he asked coming nearer to her. no indeed they were still there when the gray squirrel happened along in the afternoon. pleasant society here. you must meet some of our young people. exclaimed the gray squirrel. she cried. he exclaimed. you poor fellow i felt so sorry for you. they were a very happy couple and the next fall the gray squirrel watched them and their children gathering nuts for their winter stores. mr. red squirrel as the head of the family planned the work yet each did his share. what makes you smile when you say it cried the young red squirrels all in a breath. but she looked so happy as she spoke that the children knew there was more to the story. said he. the young red squirrels whispered to each other. life was very easy for them and they were contented. the first thing that they remembered was lying on their bed of fur hay and dried leaves and feeling a great warm soft something close beside them. after a while they learned that this something was their mamma rabbit. she didnt care so much about looking beautiful as she did about making her babies comfortable. she used to tell them about this food and they wondered and wondered how it would taste. they began to feel very big and strong now. it was growing inside their cheeks too and that made them feel important for papa rabbit said that he did not know any other animals that had fur inside their cheeks. he said it was something to be very proud of so they were very proud although why one should want fur inside of ones cheeks it would be hard to say. it almost scared him at first for he had never before felt anything at all like it. then he guessed what it meant. for the rabbit children are always blind when they are babies. exclaimed his mother who was tired of having questions asked which could not be answered. and what is the sky and why does it let the cloud come and now his eyes were surely opening and he should see ah then he looked at his brothers and sisters as they lay beside him. he would not have known what they were if he had not felt of them at the same time. he cried. im ahead of you that was not a very kind thing to say but in a minute more his brothers and sisters had reason to be glad that they couldnt see. even while he was speaking and looking toward the light he saw a brown head with two round eyes look in at him and then a great creature that he thought must surely be a dog ran in toward him. how frightened he was then he pushed his nose in among his blind brothers and sisters and tried to hide himself among them. he thought something dreadful was about to happen. the biggest little rabbit opened his eyes and there was the creature who had frightened him so and it was his own mother you can imagine how glad she was to see that one of her children had his eyes open. it was not so very long afterward that the rabbit family went out to dine in the forest and this was the first time that the children had seen their father. said the biggest little rabbit. asked the biggest little rabbit. asked the biggest little rabbit. his father gave one look upward. he said. indeed mamma bat would have been ashamed if children of hers flew against anything in the dark. and now the night was over and their mother had called them to go home. he had never seen the sun rise and he wanted to do that. he didnt believe what his father and mother said that he wouldnt have a good time if he did stay up. but now he just wouldnt go to bed so there said his father. and she looked very anxious. papa and mamma bat looked at each other without speaking. said the little bat. the little bat flew away feeling very brave. he guessed he knew how to take care of himself even in daylight. he felt sorry for his brothers who were in the cave but he made up his mind that he would tell them all about it the next night. it was very interesting but he thought they sang too loudly. the forest at night is a quiet place and he didnt see the sense of shouting so even if the sun were coming up. i wish i could see him more plainly. he cried. how warm it is i dont like that. he started to fly. just what was the matter he never knew. come to his friends. jay to add to the excitement. and last of all the ground hog appeared coming slowly and with dignity as a person who can remember his grandfather should do. he asked. and then they would have understood him at once but he was too haughty for that. he thought he had to use big words once in a while to show that he could. if people didnt understand them he was willing to explain what he meant. he must come of a very common family. and he walked away with his nose in the air. now the other forest people would have liked to watch the bat longer but after the ground hog had gone off in this way they thought it would show too much curiosity if they stayed. so one after another went away and the little bat was left alone. he fluttered around until he reached the branch where the blue jay had been and there he hung himself up to wait until night. i am hot and blind and sleepy and if any more of the forest people come and talk about me i dont know what i shall do. i only wish i could see what they look like. and then because he was a very tired little bat and cross as people always are when they have done wrong he began to blame somebody else for all his trouble. there were many things to make her so. she never laid any queen eggs. that is a law among the bees. and this was easy enough. and she began walking back and forth as fast as she could and talked a great deal and acted almost wild with impatience. you must stay with us. and she had to go for she knew in her heart that queens have to obey the law as well as other people. they knew that she was right and after all she was their queen even if she did have to obey the laws. you know how the comb looks and you know how they get the wax from which to make it but unless you are acquainted with the bees and have seen them at work you have no idea what busy creatures they are. said she kindly. asked the queen. and then you know it is not always the same kind of egg and that makes a pleasant change for me. when work is no longer a pleasure life is indeed sad. the little rabbits were fond of him and liked to listen to his stories. he was too dignified to do that. he came of an old family and he could remember who his grandfather was. perhaps if the ground hog had not belonged to so old a family he might have had a better time. however that may have been the ground hog was certainly a haughty fellow and if he had not been so gentle and kind a neighbor people would not have liked him. we do not like the name. it was not very long after this that he told the wondering young rabbits about his grandfather. ah he was a ground hog worth seeing he was clever too. and then he had such fine manners the ground hog slowly turned his head to look at her as she flew away. she should know better than to disturb those who are talking. so i was i must tell you how my grandfather came to know the world so well. but that is the way asked the smallest little rabbit. said the smallest little rabbit. i am sorry to say that my grandfather did not find out exactly what day it is that they watch for us so i have to guess at that. it is worth a great deal to belong to such a family. you might better go to see. and he waved his paw politely. she wasnt even there and when they went back they couldnt find the ground hog. they wondered how he happened to make such a mistake. it must be that she had a careless mother who did not bring her up in the right way. if that were so one should indeed be sorry for her. still even that would be no real excuse for was she not old enough now to train herself in fact she had grown children of her own and if it had not been that they took after their father they would have been a most helpless family. fortunately for them their father was a very decided snake. yes it was exceedingly lucky for them. it may not have been so good a thing for him. he did not very often ask her opinion and there were people in the forest who said he would never have talked matters over with her if he had not known that she would leave the decision to him. now this is a bad way in which to have things go in any family and it happened here as it would anywhere. he grew more and more selfish from having his own way all of the time and his wife became less and less able to take care of herself. most people thought him a very devoted husband. perhaps he was. it is easy to be a devoted husband if you always have your own way. nobody ever knew what had become of him. it was very trying. young snakes will be young snakes. then if he comes back he can find you easily. i would do that. and her friend went home thinking it was all settled. they all told her to move and she decided to do it. a fourth day was spent in finding just the right place for her home and on the fifth day she began work. when she returned she found herself obliged to cast her skin which had been growing tight and dry for some time. she said. one could not tell all the things that happened that fall or how very very very tired her friends became of having her ask their advice. when there was food in sight she did not stop for anybodys advice. she ate it as fast as she could and if she had any doubts about the wisdom of doing so she kept them to herself. when winter came she had just got her new home ready and after all she went when invited to spend the winter with a cave party of other snakes. the other was just her own age. still he beat the other one and drove him away. when he came back for his bride he found her crying. said he quite sternly. she sobbed. you will marry me and never speak to him again. and they lived most happily together. none of them had ever been acquainted with a mole. if that were so somebody should call upon him and get acquainted but how could they call said mrs. red squirrel who was like some other people in not wishing to give up her own ideas. perhaps he was angry. the little rabbits were sure of it. they said they knew by the expression of his tail. that was really a very clever thing for mr. ground hog to say. and now mrs. red squirrel was pleased and happy although her plan was not used. admire her he and i have business together. but for my part i prefer more flesh. and this also shows how clever a fellow mr.
ground hog was. mr. ground hog saw him and made his acquaintance. he began to wonder what kind of fellow the mole was. he did not like to hear him say such unkind things before a new acquaintance. sometimes unpleasant things have to be said but it was not so now. said the mole. we are always glad to meet them in the ground but they do not seem so glad to meet us. friendship is all very well but when a fellows stomach is empty he cant let that stand in the way of a good dinner. asked the ground hog. and that was the worst of it. as though id be likely to believe that i cant endure them. i guess i taught him one good lesson though. said the ground hog. i had a perfect right to dig wherever i wished and i would tell them so and they would have to go elsewhere. and he trotted away. not long afterward this highly respectable couple were feeding together in the moonlight. said she. and she gave a sigh that shook her fat sides. answered his wife. and she looked very solemn. said his wife. but it is always so. the wild turkeys come 
the wild turkeys are a wandering people and stay in one place only long enough to rear their young. it is always an exciting time when the turkeys are seen gathering on the farther side of the river and making ready to fly over. it was so this year. on the farther side of the water were a great many turkeys. when they stood in the shadow one might think that they wore no color but the brilliant red of their heads and necks where there were no feathers to cover their wrinkled skin. he cried. it is always so. they start from the highest point they can find. it will be some time before they come over and i will take a short nap. and the ground hog curled himself up beside a log and went to sleep. the rabbit wandered around and ate all the good things he could find. then he fell to wondering how it would feel to be a bird. he thought it would be great fun to fly. he had a good mind to try it. there was nobody to watch him and he crept up the trunk of a fallen tree which leaned over against its neighbors. it was a foolish thing to do and he knew it but young rabbits are too full of mischief to always be wise. he cried to the ground hog. but the ground hog never moved. still the turkeys came nearer. the rabbit could see that the fat old ones were getting ahead of the others and that here and there a young or weak turkey had to drop into the river and swim because his wings were tired. after that the rabbit left him alone. next came the mother turkeys and their young and last of all came the weak ones who swam across. it was a fine sight to see them come in. the young rabbit could hear a group of mothers talking together. the loud talking had awakened him. he did not look very dignified just now. there was a dry leaf caught on one of his ears too that made him look very odd. the rabbit wanted to laugh but he did not dare to do so. make yourselves perfectly at home. and my grandfather used to say that if a ground hog didnt love his own home he was a very poor hog indeed. and he trotted happily away followed by the rabbit. you may be sure that the forest people noticed it at once. her husband did not answer but began to arrange his new coat of feathers. perhaps too mr. robin was a trifle contrary and was all the more slow and quiet because his wife was uneasy. in that case one could hardly blame her for talking over the family plans with the neighbors. now he did not sing at all and slipped silently from bush to bush only speaking when he had to. now that she did not care to lay any more eggs the other birds were quite friendly with her. i wish i knew how many there were but i forgot to count. i have been watching and watching for my little birds to join our flock i was sure i should know them if i saw them. as though she had any right to say that they had spoken so before and rather sadly. then all the birds began to talk about dress. they seem to be a little longer and they hook together so well. the next day the wild turkeys came and there was great excitement in the forest. as though there were any danger dont think that i was asleep please. the dear old fellow really never knew how he had been nodding. life went on in this way for many days and the birds had all stopped singing. all could see that they were busily thinking and had no time for music. it was something they could not see or hear and yet it was drawing drawing drawing all day and all night. they spoke of it often to each other and the older birds told the young ones how before long they would all start south and fly over land and water until they reached their winter home. asked the children. they asked. then we cannot see which way to go but still we feel that we are drawn south and we only have to think about that and fly onward. the mothers and daughters come a few days later. the very next morning the forest people awakened to find a silvery frost on the grass and feel the still air stirred by the soft dropping of damp red brown and yellow leaves from the trees. and then the travellers went. sighed the ground hog and his wife. they will be back in the spring and we have plenty to eat. what is the use of feeling sad jay she often thought of them with longing. how lovely it would have been to have fourteen children the white things didnt say a word but they came so fast that we think they must be alive. tell us what to do. exclaimed their mother. asked her husband. it always makes one feel so very knowing when he has told his wife exactly what will happen. asked one of his children. said mr. grouse. said mrs. grouse and each little grouse hid under the leaves so quickly that nobody could see how it was done. one might almost think that a strong wind had blown them away. when she had led him far from her children she too made a quick run and hid herself and although the man hunted everywhere he could not find a single bird. you know that is always the way in grouse families and even if the mans foot had stirred the leaves under which a little one was hiding the grouse would not have moved or made a sound. the children are brought up to mind without asking any questions. it is no wonder that the older ones are proud of their children. any mother would be made happy by having one child obey like that and think of having twelve at last the whole family reached the bushes where they were to stay and then they began to feed near by. we each have a new pair every year and when they are grown we can walk easily over the soft snow. it was hard for the little ones to keep quiet long and to amuse them mr. grouse told how he first met their mother in the spring. interrupted one of the little grouse. cried the little grouse. ah what happy days we had together all spring it was rather hard to be driven off in that way but you know it is the custom among grouse. we poor fellows had to amuse ourselves and each other until our wives called us home to help take care of the children. said one of the young grouse. that made them all feel very solemn and mr. grouse couldnt answer and mrs. grouse couldnt answer and none of the little grouse could answer because you see it is one of the questions that hasnt any answer. there was food everywhere but just as i flew down to eat it turned into pieces of ice. the beautiful round moon was shining down upon him and in the western sky the clouds were still red from the rays of the setting sun. when they came back they did not dream about food. then the older people of the group began to talk of the cares of life and many other things which did not interest their children so the younger ones wandered away from them. and he turned to a crow near by. replied the blue jay. they answered for they wanted their visitors to understand that the forest was a most wonderful place and they really thought the ground hog very large. now the blue jay was afraid that the birds from the north were getting the better of him and he felt very sure that they would leave before the ground hog had finished his winter sleep so he did what no honest bird would have even thought of doing. they did not want to look at the birds from the north. he thought it would seem good to have an early spring after such a cold winter so he decided to take a walk and make the weather as his grandfather had done. he cried. they cried. then they remembered and were ashamed again because of what the blue jay had said. big as that rock is he i meant to tell you after a while. before long he and the crow were glad enough to get away from the rest and go away together. yet even then they were not happy for each began to blame the other and they had a most dreadful fight. my grandfather told us once that a lie was always a lie and that calling it a joke didnt make it any better. so they became firm friends of the ground hog even if he were not so large as the rock. the end. one day charles and two of his friends had to climb into the tall oak to avoid being caught. here he hid for a time and then went on to try and escape from the country. this time so that he might not be discovered he was dressed as a servant and rode on horseback with a lady sitting on a cushion behind him as was then the fashion. the young prince tried to win the crown back again. once he stayed for three weeks with a band of robbers who were very kind to him and though the king offered a large sum of money to anyone who would give him up not one of his poor friends was false to him. then she took him with her away from the place where the soldiers were searching and after a time he reached the sea and got safely away to france. he was a small man and his clothes were shabby. he lay dying for several hours but in spite of his great pain his one thought was of the battle. he was not a strong child and could not always run and play with other boys but had often to amuse himself at home. one holiday afternoon little james amused himself in this way. he asked his aunt to explain it but she only told him not to waste his time. he was sure it could be made of great service to men. often he sat by the fire watching the lid of the kettle as it was made to dance by the steam and thinking of many plans and at last a happy thought came to him. a great number of white people were slain before the british troops could come to their rescue but in some places they managed to hold out until help reached them. many others and especially the little children fell sick and died for the heat was very great and there was no good water to be had. then after many days a small body of white soldiers fought their way into the city and brought help and hope to the rest of the party. they were only just in time. but alas for two months longer they held out. she roused her father but they could see nothing in the darkness. it was hard work pulling against the strong sea and several times the small boat was almost sunk. but they were mistaken. he also saw that these people were often seized by strangers and taken away to be sold as slaves. for some years he was quite alone with his black servants in the midst of this wild land. but he would not return to england. he said his work was not yet done and he set out once more on his travels. it was his last journey. one morning his servants found him dead upon his bed. but he was mistaken. such was the order given during a great battle to the leader of a band of six hundred british soldiers. forward the smoke of the enemys fire closed round and hid them from their watching comrades but now and again the scarlet lines could be seen cutting down those who tried to stop their charge. alas there were not then six hundred. the rest of the noble band lay dead or dying in the valley of death. o the wild charge they made all the world wonderd. honour the charge they made war. but the boy was resolved. a shout went up from the passengers on the train. ah his struggle this time was harder for his precious load was heavy. when charles had landed the babe in safety and returned again for the girl he found her still unconscious on the floor and the water was fast flowing in at the door. in another minute she would have been drowned. a cats extraordinary leap. her husband the king was dead but she had two daughters whom she loved very much. they were tall and strong with blue eyes and yellow hair. they had been told that it was a good country and they hoped to take it for themselves. thousands were killed and the rest ran away to their ships. then she got into her chariot and with her daughters lying at her feet drove to and fro so that all might see them. and the soldiers shouted and promised to fight to the end for their brave queen. in this wood there was a small cottage and alfred asked the woman who lived there if he might go in and rest. now the woman did not know the king but she saw that he was an english soldier and that he was very tired so she let him come in and sit in her kitchen. then she went away to do her work. at first king alfred watched the cakes carefully when they were well cooked on one side he turned the other to the fire. but after a time he began to think of his country and of his poor people and then he forgot his task. when the woman came back the cakes were black and burnt. he knew king alfred. cried he. when the woman heard this she was much afraid and she begged alfred to forgive her. among these slaves were some pretty boys with long yellow hair and blue eyes and white skin. asked he of a man who was standing by. while they were eating it the english soldiers came quietly from the boats and killed most of them before they could get their swords to defend themselves. but he had many lords in his court who were very foolish. so they praised him every day and told him that all he did and all he said was good. they said he was the greatest king on earth and there was nothing in the world too hard for him to do if he chose. the chair was brought and set upon the sand and the king sat down and spoke to the waves. then the king rose and went to his lords who were standing a little way off staring at their master and talking in low tones about his strange conduct. he could not take it by force for the walls were very strong but he succeeded by another plan. he placed his soldiers all round the walls and would let no one go into the town to take food to the people. so the governor sent word to king edward that he would give up the city and begged him to have mercy on the people. but edward was angry. at this sad news the poor starving people cried aloud. but the king would not listen. and when his nobles begged him to spare such brave enemies he would not listen to them. this was hard and it made the people very angry. the nobles were much alarmed. with young king richard at their head they rode out to meet this army and to ask the people what they wanted. arms were raised and the crowd began to press forward. boldly riding to meet the angry people he put himself at their head. cried he. his mind was full of anxious thoughts for he was hiding from the english soldiers who sought to take him alive or dead to their king. just then a spider hanging from the roof of the cave by a long thread swung before the kings eyes and he left his gloomy thoughts to see what the little creature would do. the spider began to climb its thread slowly pulling itself up little by little but it had gone only a short way when it slipped and fell to the end once more. again and again it started to climb and again and again it slipped back until it had fallen six times. but the spider did no such thing. it started on its upward journey yet a seventh time and this time it did not fall. up it went inch by inch higher and higher until at last it reached the roof and was safely at home. cried the king. and now poor richard could fight no more nor could he see the blue sky and the green fields which he loved. one day as he sat sad and lonely in his prison he heard a voice singing beneath the window. he started. when the song was ended the king sang it again in a low voice. then there was a joyful cry from the man outside and richard knew that it was indeed his friend. now he hastened to england and told the people where to find their king and very soon richard was set free and went back to his own land. prince william of england and his sister and their young friends were going back to their own land after a visit to the french king. the english king henry i with his courtiers had sailed earlier and had now almost reached home. but the prince would not go with them he wished to make merry before starting. there had been eating and drinking and dancing and singing on board the white ship and everyone was merry. soon there was a crash and the ship trembled. it had struck a rock and was sinking. but he had not gone far when he heard his sister crying to him to save her. shouted he. soon the white ship sank also and of all the gay company upon it only one man was saved. when king henry heard that his only son was dead he was very sorrowful and it is said that no man ever again saw a smile upon his face. asked they. but the king would not let her go. she died as bravely as she had lived and her name will never be forgotten. twice we made for the tops of hills that showed themselves above water but on approaching them we found that they had been taken possession of by wild animals. queen margaret and the robbers. there were once two kings of england at the same time. the other was young edward duke of york called edward iv. he was made king by some of the nobles who grew weary of henry and his foolish deeds. his wife queen margaret with her little son prince edward escaped after the battle and hid themselves in a wild forest. as they wandered among the trees seeking some place where they might be safe from their enemies they met a band of robbers. these rough men took away the queens money and her jewels tearing her necklace from her neck and her rings from her fingers. they wandered on knowing not where to go hoping much to meet some of their friends and fearing still more to be found by their enemies the soldiers of the white rose. but alas they saw no kind face and night came on. the poor queen was much afraid that this robber who looked very fierce would kill her and the prince because she had no riches left to give him. he took the boy in his arms and led the way to a cave in the forest where he lived with his wife. and in this poor shelter the queen and her son stayed for two days listening to every sound and fearing that their enemies would find them. on the third day however the friendly robber met some of the lords of the red rose in the forest and led them to the cave. this took a long time to do so there were not many books and they were so dear that only the rich could buy them. he says his hand grew tired with writing and his eyes became dim with much looking on white paper. he set it up in a little shop in london and then he began to print books. in the time which it had formerly taken him to write one book he could now print thousands. many of them took written books with them which they wished to have put into print. the queen was brave and clever herself so she liked to have brave and clever people around her. but alas he went out to die. in one battle a small band of the english bravely attacked a large army of their enemies. but his friend was brave and went through the danger. then he found some water and brought it to him. this man was dying he could not speak but he looked with longing eyes at the water. sometimes the english ships met the spanish ones and robbed them of their gold for it was thought quite right and fair in those days to take every chance of doing harm to the enemies of england. once a small ship called the revenge was sailing home to england when it met with fifty great spanish vessels. there was no time to escape from the spanish ships which soon surrounded the little revenge. sir richard made up his mind to fight. then it was found that all the powder was gone and all the english were dead or dying. this was very hard and when james i was king a little band of brave people who found that they could not obey the king left their country to make a new home across the sea where they could be free. they suffered from hunger and sickness and the wild indians who lived in that land came down upon them and tried to drive them away. they were free and they worked hard and waited in patience for brighter days. by and by other ships from england brought food to keep them alive and more people to help them. he did not care at all for the good of his country and his people but thought only of his own pleasure. he took away mens money and lands and if they offended him he took their lives too. but at last a great leader arose among the people. in this way they did much harm to the enemy. then their powder and shot failed and a storm arose so they had to go back. and so england was saved. she replied that she would rather set fire to the castle and die with her children in the flames than give it up to the kings enemies. then began a fight which lasted many weeks. an old story tells us of the way he won her favour. the queen stopped in dismay for she did not like getting her feet wet and dirty. as she was thinking how best to step through the mud a young man in a rich suit came along the road. it is said that his ships first brought potatoes and tobacco to england from america and that he was the first man in this country to smoke. well so they were married. but not one word did he say about em and she thought hed wholly forgotten em. however the last day of the last month he takes her to a room shed never set eyes on before. she sat down on a stool in the kitchen and law how she did cry however all of a sudden she heard a sort of a knocking low down on the door. well the next day her husband took her into the room and there was the flax and the days food. hed hardly gone when there was a knocking against the window. and she gave it to him. well come the evening a knocking came again to the window. and all the day the girl sat trying to think of names to say to it when it came at night. but she never hit on the right one. at last it came to the last day but one. well she felt that horrid. however she heard the king coming along the passage. well they began to wonder upstairs how it was that she was so long drawing the beer and her mother went down to see after her and she found her sitting on the settle crying and the beer running over the floor. and he ran straight and turned the tap. well he set out and he travelled a long way and at last he came to a womans cottage that had some grass growing on the roof. so the gentleman asked the woman what she was doing. im going to get the cow on to the roof to eat it. well that was one big silly. at last he stopped and wiped his face with his handkerchief. i cant think who could have invented such things. it takes me the best part of an hour to get into mine every morning and i get so hot so that was another big silly. then the gentleman went on his travels again and he came to a village and outside the village there was a pond and round the pond was a crowd of people. so the gentleman turned back home again and married the farmers daughter and if they didnt live happy for ever after thats nothing to do with you or me. her hair was like golden silk and it hung to the ground. her brother loved her dearly but her wicked stepmother hated her. up came a dog and ran off with the candles. up came the dog and ran off with the candles. the stepmother was angry but she pretended not to mind the loss. down came the axe and it was off. so the mother wiped the axe and laughed. the husband tasted them and shook his head. he said they tasted very strangely. she gave some to the little boy but he would not eat. it was spring and there among the flowers was a white bird and it sang and sang and sang like an angel out of heaven. it sang the song and then flew home. the old woman and her pig 
an old woman was sweeping her house and she found a little crooked sixpence. she went a little further and she met a dog. she went a little further and she met a stick. stick beat dog she went a little further and she met a fire. fire she went a little further and she met some water. she went a little further and she met an ox. ox she went a little further and she met a butcher. butcher she went a little further and she met a rope. rope she went a little further and she met a rat. rat she went a little further and she met a cat. cat how jack went to seek his fortune 
once on a time there was a boy named jack and one morning he started to go and seek his fortune. he hadnt gone very far before he met a cat. they went a little further and they met a dog. they went a little further and they met a goat. they went a little further and they met a bull. well they went on till it was about dark and they began to think of some place where they could spend the night. about this time they came in sight of a house and jack told them to keep still while he went up and looked in through the window. and there were some robbers counting over their money. then jack went back and told them to wait till he gave the word and then to make all the noise they could. and then they went in and took possession of the house. byandby the robbers saw it was all dark and they sent one man back to the house to look after their money. before long he came back in a great fright and told them his story. in an agony of grief she rushed forth to meet her husband. he then scrambled out of the tree and went to lift up the door. when he arrived he walked up and down and at length saw a beautiful red cow. so the bargain was made and he got the cow and he drove it backwards and forwards to show it. at last he grew very tired when he saw a man coming towards him with a good stout stick in his hand. the poor king was in a terrible case. he travelled till he came to a big stone and there he sat down to rest. so he went back in a tower of a temper and this time they gave him the gardeners boy. he went off with him on his back till they got to the stone again when the giant sat down to rest. the giants daughter said she would help him and she cried all the beasts in the field and all the fowls of the air and in a minute they all came and carried away everything that was in the stable and made it all clean before the giant came home. and they hadnt got but three fields away when they looked back and saw the giant walking along at top speed after them. the giant had to tread very cautiously to get through all this and meanwhile the young lovers ran on and on and on till they were nearly out of sight. but at last the giant was through and it wasnt long before he was like to catch them up. so he goes out of the story. but the giants daughter was so weary that she couldnt move a step further. so when he asked his way to the castle she put a spell upon him and when he got to the castle no sooner was he let in than he fell down dead asleep upon a bench in the hall. the king and queen tried all they could do to wake him up but all in vain. so the king promised that if any lady could wake him up she should marry him. meanwhile the giants daughter was waiting and waiting for him to come back. and she went up into a tree to watch for him. meanwhile the gardener went down to draw water from the well and saw the shadow of the lady in the water. so he looks up and finds her and he brought the lady from the tree and led her into his house. then they took her in their arms and kissed her and said she should now be their daughter for their son should marry her. and they lived happy all their days. the wife of the farmer was a very foolish woman who had been a widow when he married her the farmer was foolish enough too and it is hard to say which of the two was the more foolish. when youve heard my tale you may decide. it was not long that jack waited after receiving the money he went off as fast as he could walk. presently the farmer came home and asked for his money. the farmer was very angry and he swore that he had never met with such a fool as his wife. but the wife said that her husband was a greater fool for letting her have the money. the farmer walked home without his horse. and when they got to the rivers bank the youngest got upon a stone to watch for the coming of the boats. now the millers daughter was cooking that day and needed water for her cooking. father and then they took out the princess and laid her on the bank. fair and beautiful she looked as she lay there. but she was drowned drowned but then all he could find of her where they had put her to rest were her bones and her golden hair. that night they were all gathered in the castle hall to hear the great harper king and queen their daughter and son sir william and all their court. mouse. what are you doing my lady my lady what are you doing

well there was once a very rich gentleman and hed three daughters and he thought hed see how fond they were of him. well he was that angry. and then she went on and on till she came to a great house. well who should be there but her masters son and what should he do but fall in love with her the minute he set eyes on her. he wouldnt dance with any one else. and when the other maids came back she was pretending to be asleep with her cap o rushes on. he danced with none but her and never took his eyes off her. when she wouldnt tell him her name nor where she came from he gave her a ring and told her if he didnt see her again he should die. the masters son he tried every way to find out where the lady was gone but go where he might and ask whom he might he never heard anything about her. and he got worse and worse for the love of her till he had to keep his bed. and when she had made it she slipped the ring into it on the sly before the cook took it upstairs. the young man he drank it and then he saw the ring at the bottom. so up she comes. so cap o rushes came. well the masters son he got well very soon and they were to be married in a little time. it was to be a very grand wedding and every one was asked far and near. and cap o rushes father was asked. but she never told anybody who she was. and after they were married all the company sat down to the dinner. and i asked her how much she loved me. and i turned her from my door for i thought she didnt love me. and now i see she loved me best of all. and she goes up to him and puts her arms round him. and so they were happy ever after. teenytiny 
once upon a time there was a teenytiny woman lived in a teenytiny house in a teenytiny village. now one day this teenytiny woman put on her teenytiny bonnet and went out of her teenytiny house to take a teenytiny walk. now when the teenytiny woman got home to her teenytiny house she was a teenytiny bit tired so she went up her teenytiny stairs to her teenytiny bed and put the teenytiny bone into a teenytiny cupboard. and all they had to live on was the milk the cow gave every morning which they carried to the market and sold. back goes jack home and as he hadnt gone very far it wasnt dusk by the time he got to his door. good boy take that take that take that and as for your precious beans here they go out of the window. and now off with you to bed. at last he dropped off to sleep. when he woke up the room looked so funny. so jack jumped up and dressed himself and went to the window. and what do you think he saw so the man spoke truth after all. so jack climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed till at last he reached the sky. the whole house began to tremble with the noise of someone coming. he was a big one to be sure. ah whats this i smell or perhaps you smell the scraps of that little boy you liked so much for yesterdays dinner. all happened as it did before. but this time he knew better than to go straight to the ogres house. as before and in come the ogre and his wife. by this time jack had climbed down and climbed down and climbed down till he was very nearly home. mother are you here before me then he could not tell what to do. he went to the little pigs house and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him. when the little pig saw what he was about he hung on the pot full of water and made up a blazing fire and just as the wolf was coming down took off the cover and in fell the wolf so the little pig put on the cover again in an instant boiled him up and ate him for supper and lived happy ever afterwards. now the master had a pupil who was but a foolish lad and he acted as servant to the great master but never was he suffered to look into the black book hardly to enter the private room. the boy only trembled and his hair stood up. then the evil spirit stepped towards him and putting forth his hands touched his throat. the fingers burned his flesh. it rose to the boys knees and still more water was poured. it still rose it reached his breast. and their son never saw any other people in his life but he knew that there was some more in the world besides his own father and mother because he had lots of books and he used to read every day about them. and when he read about some pretty young women he used to go mad to see some of them till one day when his father was out cutting wood he told his mother that he wished to go away to look for his living in some other country and to see some other people besides them two. he said that night was on him and he wanted to get some place to sleep. jack said the silly fellow that he could do anything. he meant that he could do any foolish bit of work that would be wanted about the house. by this time jack dressed himself and said his prayers and came down laughing for he was proud he was because the thing was done so well. but oh dear there is worse to come yet. and by this time jack has a beautiful horse and a scarlet dress to go with them. and that man opened the little box and there hopped the three little red men out and asked him what he wanted with them. that poor silly jack is threatened by taking his beautiful young wife from him for taking them in in the way he did. until at last he comes up to the place where lives the king of all the little mice in the world. and all the little mice said no there was none of them had seen it. the king came out and asked him his business and jack told him all from beginning to end. jack refused him for a bit but at last he told him to jump up and jack put him in his other waistcoat pocket. and jack passed him and he never said a word to him and he talked with the king and told him everything all about the castle. and when he got up in the morning the king and he went on to some field and there the king made some funny noise and there came all the fowls that were in all the world. the king asked the great bird did he see the great castle now when they came in sight of the castle they did not know what to do to get the little golden box. he came running out with it laughing his best. and he told them no. and the king is very proud to see them and has a hearty welcome and a long conversation. and there was no one left behind there only the cook and another maid with her and the little red men asked them which would they rather go or stop behind and poor thing through them not going on with what they begun with they very near came to danger as the castle was once very near sinking in the middle of the sea. at length after a merry journey they come again to jack and the king. the king was quite struck with the sight of the castle and going up the golden stairs went to see the inside. jack takes a farewell of the king and thanks him very much for his hospitality. away went jack and his castle again and stopped one night in that place and away they went again to the third place and there left the castle under his care. as jack had to leave the castle behind he had to take to his own horse which he left there when he first started. but that did not stop long. and off they went and were not long before they reached their journeys end when out comes the young wife to meet him with a fine lump of a young son and they all lived happy ever afterwards. the story of the three bears 
once upon a time there were three bears who lived together in a house of their own in a wood. and while they were walking a little old woman came to the house. the door was not fastened because the bears were good bears who did nobody any harm and never suspected that anybody would harm them. so the little old woman opened the door and went in and well pleased she was when she saw the porridge on the table. so first she tasted the porridge of the great huge bear and that was too hot for her and she said a bad word about that. and then she tasted the porridge of the middle bear and that was too cold for her and she said a bad word about that too. and the naughty old woman said a wicked word about that too. and first she lay down upon the bed of the great huge bear but that was too high at the head for her. and next she lay down upon the bed of the middle bear and that was too high at the foot for her. and then she lay down upon the bed of the little small wee bear and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot but just right. so she covered herself up comfortably and lay there till she fell fast asleep. by this time the three bears thought their porridge would be cool enough so they came home to breakfast. now the little old woman had left the spoon of the great huge bear standing in his porridge. and when the middle bear looked at his he saw that the spoon was standing in it too. upon this the three bears seeing that some one had entered their house and eaten up the little small wee bears breakfast began to look about them. now the little old woman had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the great huge bear. and you know what the little old woman had done to the third chair. now the little old woman had pulled the pillow of the great huge bear out of its place. and she had heard the middle voice of the middle bear but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. but when she heard the little small wee voice of the little small wee bear it was so sharp and so shrill that it awakened her at once. up she started and when she saw the three bears on one side of the bed she tumbled herself out at the other and ran to the window. but the three bears never saw anything more of her. you shall pay dearly for this. jack then filled up the pit with earth and went to search the cave which he found contained much treasure. after this the giant locked poor jack in an immense chamber leaving him there while he went to fetch another giant his brother living in the same wood who might share in the meal on jack. the next morning jack laughing in his sleeve gave him hearty thanks for his nights lodging. the king did his best to persuade his son from it but in vain so at last gave way and the prince set out with two horses one loaded with money the other for himself to ride upon. early in the morning jack furnished his master with a fresh supply of gold and silver and then sent him three miles forward on his journey at which time the prince was pretty well out of the smell of the giant. the prince went to bed in great sorrow but jacks cap of knowledge informed him how it was to be obtained. on that day she gave the prince a kiss and told him he must show her the lips tomorrow morning that she kissed last night or lose his head. this broke the enchantment and the evil spirit left her and she appeared in all her beauty. are you there through many woods he passed and came at length to the foot of a high mountain. then the enchantment was broken and all the lords and ladies who had so long been transformed into birds and beasts returned to their proper shapes and the castle vanished away in a cloud of smoke. so married they were and the whole kingdom was filled with joy at the wedding. something hit her upon the head. so they went along and they went along and they went along till they came to a narrow and dark hole. but she would not at first for he was the last of her children she now had and if he was lost all would be lost. but he begged and he begged till at last the good queen let him go and gave him his fathers good brand that never struck in vain. one thing to do and one thing not to do. these he knew by their fiery eyes and knew that he was at last in the land of fairy. open door and let me come in. open door and let me come in. there were neither windows nor candles and he could not make out where the twilight came from if not through the walls and roof. and when he opened them there he saw a most wonderful and glorious sight. had you a hundred thousand lives   ye couldnt spare any a one. so she rose up and went out and soon brought back a golden basin full of bread and milk. they travelled and travelled and could see never a house. it began to be dark and they were hungry. at last they saw a light and made for it it turned out to be a house. and in the middle of the night up rose the giant armed with a great club and felt for the necks with the straw. it was dark. they all got out safe and they ran and ran and never stopped until morning when they saw a grand house before them. so she went back and managed to slip into the giants house and crept in below the bed. the giant came home and ate up a great supper and went to bed. and she had two sons and byandby it was time for the wife to send them away to seek their fortune. so she told her eldest son one day to take a can and bring her water from the well that she might bake a cake for him and however much or however little water he might bring the cake would be great or small accordingly and that cake was to be all that she could give him when he went on his travels. the lad went away with the can to the well and filled it with water and then came away home again but the can being broken the most part of the water had run out before he got back. so his cake was very small yet small as it was his mother asked him if he was willing to take the half of it with her blessing telling him that if he chose rather to take the whole he would only get it with her curse. so the young man went to seek his fortune. and he went all that day and all the next day and on the third day in the afternoon he came up to where a shepherd was sitting with a flock of sheep. so the young man went on and byandby he saw a multitude of very dreadful beasts with two heads and on every head four horns. and he went into the castle for shelter and there he saw an old wife sitting beside the kitchen fire. he thought if he could put over the night he might get away in the morning without meeting with the beasts and so escape. and when he had got him out he told him that if he could answer him three questions his life should be spared. he told his mother that the time was now come for him to go away upon his travels also so she requested him to take the can to the well for water that she might make a cake for him. and he went and as he was bringing home the water a raven over his head cried to him to look and he would see that the water was running out. then the old woman who was a fairy told him a great deal that would happen to him and what he ought to do in all circumstances and after that she vanished in an instant out of his sight. and then he put the three questions to him but the young man had been told everything by the good fairy so he was able to answer all the questions. next day they all set out for the kings court and a gallant company they made. and the king married his daughter to the young man that had delivered her and gave a nobles daughter to his brother and so they all lived happily all the rest of their days. the golden arm 
here was once a man who travelled the land all over in search of a wife. he saw young and old rich and poor pretty and plain and could not meet with one to his mind. at last he found a woman young fair and rich who possessed a right arm of solid gold. he married her at once and thought no man so fortunate as he was. at last she died. he hurried home to hide his treasure and thought no one would know. the following night he put the golden arm under his pillow and was just falling asleep when the ghost of his dead wife glided into the room. he therefore asked them why they were so melancholy and learned that they were miserable because they had no children. was not a bit bigger than his fathers thumb. the queen of the fairies wishing to see the little fellow came in at the window while the mother was sitting up in the bed admiring him. he roared out with pain and begged to be let out promising never to steal again. soon after the adventure of the pudding toms mother went to milk her cow in the meadow and she took him along with her. fortunately his mother caught him in her apron as he was falling to the ground or he would have been dreadfully hurt. she then put tom in her bosom and ran home with him. a raven which was flying over picked him up and flew with him over the sea and there dropped him. a large fish swallowed tom the moment he fell into the sea which was soon after caught and bought for the table of king arthur. when they opened the fish in order to cook it every one was astonished at finding such a little boy and tom was quite delighted at being free again. king arthur one day asked tom about his parents wishing to know if they were as small as he was and whether they were well off. tom told the king that his father and mother were as tall as anybody about the court but in rather poor circumstances. our little hero had some difficulty in lifting the burden upon his back but he at last succeeded in getting it placed to his mind and set forward on his journey. however without meeting with any accident and after resting himself more than a hundred times by the way in two days and two nights he reached his fathers house in safety. but he soon returned to court. he also gave him a coach drawn by six small mice. alive he filled the court with mirth   his death to sorrow soon gave birth. tom thumb is dead mr. fox 
lady mary was young and lady mary was fair. she had two brothers and more lovers than she could count. no one knew who mr. fox was but he was certainly brave and surely rich and of all her lovers lady mary cared for him alone. at last it was agreed upon between them that they should be married. lady mary asked mr. fox where they should live and he described to her his castle and where it was but strange to say did not ask her or her brothers to come and see it. but as the gate was open she went through it and found no one there. so she went up to the doorway and over it she found written
be bold be bold but not too bold. still she went on till she came into the hall and went up the broad stairs till she came to a door in the gallery over which was written
be bold be bold but not too bold lest that your hearts blood should run cold. but lady mary was a brave one she was and she opened the door and what do you think she saw just as he got near lady mary mr. fox saw a diamond ring glittering on the finger of the young lady he was dragging and he tried to pull it off. the sword cut off the hand which jumped up into the air and fell of all places in the world into lady marys lap. and when mr. fox was seated at table opposite lady mary he looked at her. at once her brothers and her friends drew their swords and cut mr. fox into a thousand pieces. lazy jack 
once upon a time there was a boy whose name was jack and he lived with his mother on a common. so they called him lazy jack. his mother could not get him to do anything for her and at last told him one monday that if he did not begin to work for his porridge she would turn him out to get his living as he could. in the evening jack took the cheese and went home with it on his head. now she had never laughed in her life and the doctors said she would never speak till somebody made her laugh. they lived in a large house and jacks mother lived with them in great happiness until she died. then she took it home to her own room. she was startled for the door had been locked for hours. today i crossed the sea and saw you for the first time and i was glad to be a bird that i could come near you. seven years passed thus and then a great trouble came to them. and he flew and he flew till he was over the deep deep sea and yet on he flew till he came to his mothers castle. alas surely a wedding party was never so disturbed in this world. but body o me ive forgot the herbs and its bitter youll taste without herbs. well you shant do it again. ill watch over you myself. for it was a leg of the sofa that he had put out. at last a goodnatured looking gentleman saw how hungry he looked. so the kind merchant ordered him to be taken into the house and have a good dinner given him and be kept to do what work he was able to do for the cook. his bed stood in a garret where there were so many holes in the floor and the walls that every night he was tormented with rats and mice. soon after this his master had a ship ready to sail and as it was the custom that all his servants should have some chance for good fortune as well as himself he called them all into the parlour and asked them what they would send out. they all had something that they were willing to venture except poor dick who had neither money nor goods and therefore could send nothing. for this reason he did not come into the parlour with the rest but miss alice guessed what was the matter and ordered him to be called in. the king and queen were seated at the upper end of the room and a number of dishes were brought in for dinner. they had not sat long when a vast number of rats and mice rushed in and devoured all the meat in an instant. he put puss under his arm and arrived at the place just in time to see the table full of rats. when the cat saw them she did not wait for bidding but jumped out of the captains arms and in a few minutes laid almost all the rats and mice dead at her feet. the captain then took leave of the royal party and set sail with a fair wind for england and after a happy voyage arrived safe in london. they then told the story of the cat and showed the rich present that the king and queen had sent for her to poor dick. he begged his master to take what part of it he pleased since he owed it all to his kindness. they had several children. in came a huge huge head and sat down on the small small neck. and at the appointed day came down to the castle gate with the keys all ready to hand over to her stepmother. soon the procession drew near and the new queen came towards princess margaret who bowed low and handed her the keys of the castle. so back they came to the queen witch who knew not what to do. he wrapped his cloak about her and then went up to the castle with her. so one day when his little boy was four years old he looked into the book of fate to see what would happen to him. now the baron knew the father of the little girl was very very poor and he had five children already. there the fisherman found her and took pity on the poor little thing and took her into his house and she lived there till she was fifteen years old and a fine handsome girl. now that very night a band of robbers broke into the inn and searched the girl who had no money and only the letter. so they opened this and read it and thought it a shame. when she gave the letter to his brother he gave orders for the wedding to be prepared at once and they were married that very day. and when he got her all alone he took her by the arms and was going to throw her over. but she begged hard for her life. now one day who should she see coming up to the nobles house but the baron and his brother and his son her husband. she didnt know what to do but thought they would not see her in the castle kitchen. she was right glad to see it you may be sure. then she cooked the fish as nicely as she could and served it up. well when the fish came on the table the guests liked it so well that they asked the noble who cooked it. but the baron was in a tower of a temper and started up as if he would do her some violence. so the girl went up to him with her hand before her with the ring on it and she put it down before him on the table. then at last the baron saw that no one could fight against fate and he handed her to a seat and announced to all the company that this was his sons true wife and he took her and his son home to his castle and they all lived as happy as could be ever afterwards. so she put all the birds round her and began to show them how to do it. first of all she took some mud and made a sort of round cake with it. so it went on every bird taking away some knowledge of how to build nests but none of them waiting to the end. so the queen was now quite satisfied and went back home. her own daughter kate however took a fine linen cloth and wrapped it round her sisters head and took her by the hand and they both went out to seek their fortune. they went on and they went on and they went on till they came to a castle. kate knocked at the door and asked for a nights lodging for herself and a sick sister. and the curious thing was that whoever watched him at night was never seen any more. so the king had offered a peck of silver to anyone who would stop up with him. till midnight all goes well. kate followed but he didnt seem to notice her. they rode on and on till they came to a green hill. the prince entered a magnificent hall brightly lighted up and many beautiful fairies surrounded the prince and led him off to the dance. meanwhile kate without being noticed hid herself behind the door. at last the cock crew and the prince made all haste to get on horseback kate jumped up behind and home they rode. kate said the prince had a good night but she would not sit up another night unless she was to get a peck of gold. the second night passed as the first had done. the prince got up at midnight and rode away to the green hill and the fairy ball and kate went with him gathering nuts as they rode through the forest. this time she did not watch the prince for she knew he would dance and dance and dance. the third night kate consented to watch only if she should marry the sick prince. all went on as on the first two nights. but sometimes it would be in a good temper and then what ah me where was i woes me woes me he ran and he ran till he could run no longer and then he ran right up against a little old woman who was gathering sticks. he was too much out of breath to beg pardon but the woman was goodnatured and she said he seemed to be a likely lad so she would take him to be her servant and would pay him well. when the year had passed she called him to her and said she had good wages for him. so jack without knowing that any change had been made rode away next morning to his fathers house. now i must tell you that near his home dwelt a poor widow with an only daughter. i promise you he ran. ah that night he fetched down from his attic a table very like that of jack and exchanged the two. the lad set it in the middle of the room and bade it be covered but all in vain the table remained bare. a man picked him out and bade him assist him in making a bridge over the river and how do you think he was doing it then he galloped home on the ass with the table on his shoulders and the stick in his hand. it was soon known through the town that jack had returned rolling in wealth and accordingly all the girls in the place set their caps at him. they rode and they rode till at last they stopped before a cottage door. after a while it began to open its eyes. but she couldnt help wondering what it was for as she had never seen such a thing done before. no sooner had she done so than everything seemed changed about her. the mother in the bed was a beautiful lady dressed up in white silk. but she said nothing to nobody and as soon as the lady was well enough to mind the baby she asked the old fellow to take her back home. and what do you think he was doing the well of the worlds end 
once upon a time and a very good time it was though it wasnt in my time nor in your time nor any one elses time there was a girl whose mother had died and her father had married again. and her stepmother hated her because she was more beautiful than herself and she was very cruel to her. she used to make her do all the servants work and never let her have any peace. well the girl started off and asked every one she met to tell her where was the well of the worlds end. but nobody knew and she didnt know what to do when a queer little old woman all bent double told her where it was and how she could get to it. so she did what the old woman told her and at last arrived at the well of the worlds end. the stepmother was fine and angry but she said nothing at all. so the girl went and opened the door and there was the frog from the well of the worlds end. when she got there he told her that he had something to teach her for that in his house he had his own names for things. in the midst of all his glory his queen died leaving behind her an only daughter about fifteen years of age who for her beauty and kindness was the wonder of all that knew her. then up came a second and a third head saying the same as the former. she had not travelled long before she saw a king hunting in the park with his nobles. the king her father was at first astonished that his daughter had been so fortunate till the young king let him know of all that had happened. being now all over blood she searched for water to wash herself and looking round she saw the well. he said that he flew in the air and lived in the trees. the judge therefore decided in favour of the owl. arrived there she found the dead man but the ring was difficult to remove so she drew it off with her teeth. he gave no reason for having thus said and returned to his home. the young girl called her parents and told them the message of the crows. these became a man and a woman. the real mother 
there was once a rajah who had seven wives six of these were rich and dwelt in his palace but the seventh was poor and lived apart in a little mud hut by herself. the rajah had one great sorrow and that was that he had no children. he did not know that the fakir had been asleep for twelve years so he pressed his hands and feet and the old man awoke. no sooner had they done this when all seven fell down and died. the poor potter and his wife found them thus when they came to search for them some hours later and although the woman wept the man at once set out in search of the old fakir and as soon as he found him he told him what had happened. this the potter did and lo he too tried to gather flowers but found he could not do so. when this happened the old fakirs grave opened and he came back to life and brought the brothers and sisters with him. so one day he ran away and made himself a house above ground. now at this time there was a girl living in that place who had a very cruel stepmother and this woman made her spend the whole day picking up sticks in the forest. but the girl was afraid for who would marry a snake this the girl told him and he readily agreed. but he came not and she was very unhappy. together they ran away and escaped to the upper world and found their former home where they lived happily ever after. the power of fate 
there was once a rajah who had six daughters none of whom were married although all were grown up. one day he called them to him and asked each in turn whether she was satisfied with her lot in life and what fate had given to her. now the princess was very religious so she spent her time in reading and said her prayers five times a day believing that if it were her fate to die she would die but if not some help would be sent to her. after she had eaten and drunk she washed the brass vessels in which her food had come and continued to pray and give thanks to god. one day the king her father riding by that way was greatly surprised when he saw what a beautiful house and garden had been made in the midst of the jungle. the rajah was indeed surprised and hastened to find out for himself whether or not the news were true. when the princess met him she reminded him of what she had said about fate and her belief that what was to be would be in spite of all efforts to prevent it so that the rajah also was convinced that she was right. not long afterwards the rajah made up his mind to travel and asked each of his five children what they would like him to bring her on his return. they all wanted something different and he had almost forgotten to ask his youngest daughter what she wanted as she already had all that heart could wish but he felt ashamed to leave her out so he asked her also. this seemed a large sum to pay for so small and as it appeared to him common a thing yet rather than return without it the rajah paid the price and returned to his own country. his five daughters were delighted with their gifts and he sent the box to the youngest princess. no sooner had she done so when a fine handsome prince stood in her presence but when she waved in the opposite direction from herself he disappeared. the five sisters soon came to show their youngest sister their presents and laughed when they saw a simple little box asking what made her choose such a plain common thing. at first her servants would not consent and declared they would follow wherever she went but after a time the princess had her way and set out on her journey. began the parrot. this conversation was eagerly listened to by the princess and afterwards she carefully gathered the refuse beside the eagles nest and again started with all haste on her journey. or doctor and was instantly summoned to the kings palace for he had promised even to give up his kingdom to any one who would save his son. at last he got well and was able to leave his room so the princess went to the rajah and begged permission to return to her own country. why need you do that such is the power of fate. so the children crossed over and waited for him but soon to their grief they saw the umbrella floating down the stream and then they knew that their father had been drowned. after this they wandered about for many days and passed through many cities. at last they came to a house in the woods where a woman was sitting. next day she told them to go and fetch wood but kept back the eldest to sweep the house and to keep her company. in the evening when the other sisters returned they found their eldest sister was missing and the witch who did not wish them to know that she had eaten the child told them that she had run back to her parents. at last the old witch told her to stay at home that day to sweep the house and look after it while she went out. the child swept the room and then out of curiosity opened a box which stood in the corner and to her horror she saw inside it the four heads of her sisters the poor child was much alarmed and asked what she could do to escape. the child quickly did as the heads told her tied the bundle and ran away. there was only a broom left in the room and when the old witch returned she mounted upon it and flew through the air in hot pursuit. and the tree opened and she was hidden within it all but her little finger which remained outside as the tree closed. this the old witch saw and promptly bit off
while she ate it she regretted more than once that such a dainty morsel had escaped but she knew there was no getting out the child so she went away disappointed. the girl came out and walked up to a brahmin this decided the question of her birth and that she was fitted to become the wife of a prince. note. she is now a fine healthy child and very devoted. this she did but while giving the fire to the man he seized her and placing her upon his horse rode away. but the dog knew her and that evening he spoke to his master and asked him if he too had seen his wife. when they arrived at the robbers house and made themselves known the woman was greatly vexed for the robber was rich and gave her a very comfortable home but she pretended to be friendly and invited her husband to dine there that night telling him that afterwards when he had the chance he could kill the robber. he was a wise dog and knew the woman was wicked so she hated him and made up her mind that she would neither eat nor drink until he was dead. this the man refused to do but after a while he consented. all were surprised when he stood before the judge and asked leave to speak. one day it entered her head to deceive the rajah so she told him that before the end of the year an heir would be born in the palace. the poor little squirrel was indeed at her wits end how to perform the task for how could so small an animal make so difficult a dish then she told him all that had happened. this was the first time the rajah had seen or kissed his daughter and he was indeed pleased to find she was so beautiful. the viziers son and the rajahs son 
the viziers and the rajahs son were great friends and always together. this made the rajah very jealous and he called an old woman whom he knew and asked her to separate the two. this was a difficult task as they were such fast friends but the old woman was anxious to gain a reward and said she would do it so she called the viziers son and when he asked her what she required remained silent. then she called the rajahs son and did the same. then the man confessed everything and went and searched for the lad and brought him back. so they set out to seek her and soon found the palace in which she lived and outside a girl making a wreath of flowers for the princess. at the first opportunity he called to the eldest who was the viziers son and pretended to whisper in his ear. then the friends went together to discover what the woman meant nor was the viziers son long in finding the meaning. this was an unexpected turn of affairs so the viziers son quickly dressed himself as a beautiful woman and asked to see his friend in the prison. the thieves did not know what to make of it and ran away leaving their stolen property behind. one day the rajah of that place heard some enemies were coming in force to attack his capital. so when darkness fell he crept out and caught his donkey by the ear and led it to its stable and there tied it to a post to wait till he was ready to get on its back but when he returned with a light what was his surprise to find it was not his donkey but the tiger that he had led by the ear and tied to a post. a little further on he saw an old woman pulling grass with her hands. as soon as they were ready he picked them up and ran away. said the rabbit gaily. so the man got on and the rabbit ran off with the bride but her husband ran after and advised his wife to kill the rabbit. thus ended the adventures of the rabbit. after some years the woman had two sons and when they had grown to be big boys she died. her husband had forgotten her conversation about the birds and he married another wife. one day the eldest boy was playing with a ball when it fell into his stepmothers room. they talked on many subjects. on hearing this the youngest brother crept out of bed and taking his gun shot both birds and cooked them. in the morning his elder brother awoke and found a meal prepared for him so he ate the bird and then tried to wake his companion but soon discovered that the boy was dead. close to this place a rajah had just died and his people placed his crown in the trunk of an elephant leaving it to him to place it upon the head of any man there and that man would be their future king. at such times it was necessary to kill a man and then the sand was pleased at the sacrifice and let the ship go. as soon as he did this the ship moved on and so the merchant would not part with him or kill him but kept him during the whole voyage and brought him back to the town. in order to get news of him he sent out a notice that he would pay any one who would come daily and talk with him for he hoped in the course of conversation that some one would mention the circumstance of the boy who was found dead in a tree in the forest. so the lad began. thus saying he took out the tigers ears and whiskers and as his eyes met his brothers they recognised each other and fell upon each others necks. as he walked he kept thinking of the future. she awoke with a scream and the robbers ran away. when he got outside he saw a camel laden with all sorts of treasure. after this his mother advised him to return to his wife who must wonder what had become of him. on this his wife was exceedingly vexed and turned him out of the house. he returned to his mother who asked him what had happened. ah ha this is indeed sad news. so she turned him out. the monkey the tiger and the princess 
once upon a time there was a king who had seven sons and he made up his mind that he would not let them marry unless they married seven sisters so he sent his brahmin to seek a rajah who had seven daughters and to bring him word. after a time the brahmin succeeded and found a rajah who had seven daughters so arrangements were speedily made for their marriage. his father thought this a very wise suggestion so they set out leaving the youngest brother at home. at night the tigers formed a ring round the camp and said they would eat every one in it unless one of the princesses was given up to them. none of the six princes would give up his wife. at last they decided to leave the seventh princess to the tigers. at last an old man told him what had happened and the young prince who was very angry and disappointed with his brothers at once set out to seek his bride. no sooner did they agree than they carried out their plan. the rat ate all the clothes worn by the prince and the jackal ate his horse so that when he awoke it was to find himself alone in the forest without either horse or clothes. just then a monkey came down from the tree and asked him what was the matter. then the two mounted the horse and rode into the forest where they soon found the princess sitting tied up in a den with an old blind tiger in charge of her. the blind tiger held two strings one was attached to the girl and the other to a large tiger who had gone out with the rest of the tigers but who at the slightest pull of the string was ready to return to give any assistance required of him. the monkey whispered to the girl to try and free herself and meantime he began to sweep the room and busy himself so that the old blind tiger might think the girl was busy at her household work. asked the tiger. by this time both the prince and the princess had escaped in safety and the monkey joined them. so one day he determined to make the princess so angry that she would herself turn him out. he awaited his opportunity and broke all the thread as she was spinning. then they all came home and let the monkey sport in the forest as before. this made the jackal wild with anger so he ran after the go to kill it and caught its tail in his teeth just as the go was getting into a hole. and in order to say it had to open his mouth so the go escaped the story of the black cow 
there was a certain brahmin whose wife died leaving him one little son. each day the two children went out together to attend to the cattle and at night they returned home to eat their food. the boy told her everything and presently she beat her hoofs upon the ground. that day when the brahmin came home his wife begged him to sell the black cow and said she would neither sleep nor eat until this was done. the poor boy was sad indeed when he heard this and went at once to his favourite where throwing himself on the black cows neck he wept bitterly. so they escaped to a forest and there lived in peace and security for many days. this wish the snake readily granted but both cow and boy afterwards regretted their request for they feared robbers. this fish was caught by a fisherman and taken for sale to the kings palace. when they cut it open all present admired the lovely golden hair and when the princess saw it she said she would never be happy again until she met the owner. at first the brahmins son would not listen but after a time he came up to the boat when to his surprise he was at once seized tied up and carried away. arrived at the kings palace he met the princess who was very beautiful and when he saw her he forgot everything else and thought only of her. the brahmin and the wild geese 
there was once a brahmin who had a large family and was very poor. now this made his wife very angry for she thought that the longer he begged the more he should gain. his conduct attracted the attention of a couple of wild geese who had their nest near by. yet he would not listen and going up to the brahmin asked him the reason of his strange conduct. this the brahmin gladly consented to do and returned to his home a rich man. that very day the rajah sent for the brahmin and told him to go without delay and fetch him a wild goose when he would reward him greatly. the geese watched him with much concern for they wondered what had caused this fresh trouble after all that had been done for him. so the foolish bird came nearer and no sooner had he done so than the brahmin seized him and put him in a bag with only his head out. as they went along the poor goose shed bitter tears of reproach and each tear became a beautiful pearl. the rajahs son chanced to come that way saw the pearls and followed in their track until he came to the spot where the brahmin sat. this made the prince very angry and he at once released the goose who gladly flew away. this went on for some time and then the geese decided to find a wife for their visitor. now a lovely princess lived in a palace close to that place and one night while she slept the two geese joined wings under her bed and carried her to the river. in the morning when she awoke she was surprised to find herself in this lonely place. the wild geese gave them many beautiful and valuable gifts and they went to live in the former home of the princess. this being the case he began to make preparations to leave and to make over his kingdom to her but as he was about to do this his servants who knew of the bet advised him not to be so foolish but to take another wife and to do away with this one rather than part with the kingdom. at first the king would not listen but after a time he agreed to leave the matter in their hands. soon after this a little daughter was born to her and when the child was a month old the three fairies took their leave but before going each determined to leave a parting gift for the little princess. the first said that whenever she placed her foot on a stone it would turn to either silver or gold. the third said that whenever she cried pearls would fall from her eyes. all these things came to pass so in time they built a beautiful palace. the old man told him how he had found the box and all about the queen his wife whom he thought was dead. now the indian people dread the punishment of a holy fakir so the queen returned to her former palace and lived happily ever after. yet i cannot discover why my fruits are bitter. he did not know that this holy man had slept for twelve years and was just about to awake. while he stood there the old fakir opened his eyes and saw him. said the king. after it he returned to his own home and there his elder brother met him. three wise men and the kings daughter 
a king had a very beautiful daughter and was anxious that she should marry some one who had made himself famous in some particular way. three men in the city came forward and begged the king for her hand in marriage. asked the king. the king was pleased and went and told his daughter asking her to choose which she would have as a husband. the king agreed but on the morrow she was nowhere to be found and her father much distressed went to the three wise men. then the king turned to the other two men. there they found the kings daughter guarded by a fairy. the third man soon shot the fairy with his bow and arrow and lifting the princess upon his horse returned with her to her father. now each man felt that he had an equal claim upon her and had earned her as his wife so the king asked her to decide. moral. his prayer was granted and he married the girl. so after bidding his wife a loving farewell he went sadly away and cutting off his head placed it near the stone as a sacrifice. the bride finding neither father nor husband return went forth in search of them and seeing what had happened determined to add her own life to the sacrifice. the delighted girl immediately did as she was directed and the two heads were united to the bodies so that she once again saw her husband and father alive. they bade her cease weeping. thus they settled the matter and returned home. moral. the tiger thought this an excellent idea and immediately sent for a cat. now the cat was a very cunning animal and thought to herself how nice it was to be in the service of the tiger. so she kept watching by the tiger all night and drove away the rats. moral. moral. let well alone. asked her husband. as loudly as they could. the thief thinking they were only pretending remained silent under the bed waiting for their return. they soon came back with a number of friends who caught the thief and took him away to prison. asked the eldest brother. asked the second. so they went and the man told the priest his story. said the priest. these answers pleased the priest very much and he gave a feast for the brothers. during the feast he sat down and unknown to them watched and listened to find out what they were talking about. then the priest ran out and caught the man who had sold him the grain. demanded he. the butcher admitted that it was the flesh of a goat which had dropped dead and had not been killed. going back the priest resolved to catch the boys in their own net and he told them a story about two men and a thief. the eldest boy said he liked one man and the second the other but the third preferred the thief on this the boy confessed that he had stolen it and taking it out of his pocket restored it to his brother. the three went home together and lived happily ever afterwards. this the snake promised but instead of returning it remained within him and refused to come back. then they began a conversation. you were given permission to drink water and this is how you treat the holy fakir and break your promise to return without doing him any harm you know that you cannot use them yourself and yet you will allow nobody else to touch them she also sought the seed which would kill the snake her husband had swallowed and gave it to him to eat. moral. then he cooked some bread which he ate and again beat the jackal. to this the rajah who loved his daughter gladly consented and gave them a fine house and grounds. so she asked him one day to tell her the whole truth about himself and he did so. the dog who was a rajah 
a daughter was once born to a brahmin and his wife and from the day of its birth a dog came daily and laid down in the house. here she sat down and told the dog she was thirsty. as she approached the dog followed her and they saw a ladder leading to the bottom of the well so that they climbed down and came to a fine house with lovely gardens and flowers and servants ready to receive them. these belonged to the dog who was in reality a rajah and only assumed the shape of a dog when he left the well. some time after this the brahmin expressed a wish to go and visit his daughter. he followed out her directions and found the small trees led to the well and as he felt thirsty he looked in and saw the ladder so he descended by it and found the dog had become a rajah. going round the grounds with his daughter he noticed a house made of gold. asked he. so he went in and found everything perfect except that in one of the walls was a great crack. hearing this the youngest of the four wives asked if she might be allowed to bake some bread to take for them to eat on the journey. they journeyed far away into another country and were very poor. it was carefully covered over with a piece of clean white cloth so that nothing was noticed. the woman did so but as soon as she got near enough she began to eat her supposed husband. then the young man entered the shop and lifting up the great stone beheld the two unfortunate men who were nearly starved to death. having released them he took the thief to the king and told him what had happened. a gay company with songs and music set out and everything went well until they reached the middle of the stream. the old woman alone who had remained at home on account of her feeble age escaped and sad indeed was she when she came to hear of her daughters fate. this went on for twenty years he said. o river restore the dead on such occasions he generally called on anybody near at hand to assist him up or give him a push upwards. note. in the village there once lived a man whose wife died leaving an only daughter. she had to cook her fathers food and carry it to him in the fields to draw water for the cattle and look after them besides many other things which took up her time and strength. after a time the water sank to its usual level. he began to suspect that some unknown man a stranger to himself used to help her and determined to watch. as usual his daughter came with the cattle and all happened as before. he was struck with wonder and amazement at what he saw. just as the girl was about to take her usual bath she looked up and saw him. in a moment she felt that he had suspected her of some evil. moral. there is good sometimes in even the evil things in life. every day the man gathered sticks and sold them while the woman remained at home. the woman was attracted by its brightness and locked it up in a box. the foolish woman parted with her treasure not knowing that it was a pearl of great value and returned home laden with good things. but ill dreams disturbed the rajahs rest and he could not sleep. could it be fancy or did he really see a strange man standing before him so the rajah listened and the strange man went away. and was that all no when they cut it down there was found deep in the earth one living root and that they left for who can destroy the soul the roots of charity are always green. said the fakir. arrived there she asked him to stand at the door and left the goat outside. and he did as he was told but no sooner had he done so when the head rose up into the air with him away through space for hundreds of miles until he came to a wall which surrounded a space twelve miles square. on the morning following he opened the third door and found a camel inside. at last his stepmother heard of his return and sent for him. he told her that he would give anything to be able to return to the place from which the donkey had brought him. what are you willing to do in order to return do not kill your son. moral. after a while they found themselves all alone and as night fell were very frightened and hid themselves in the hollow of a large tree. here a tiger found them and ate six leaving only the youngest sister alive. she hid in the tree for several days and at last a rajah found her and asked how she had got there. then she told him the whole story and he felt pity for her and married her. then she called a crow and asked it if it would go to her former home with a letter from her. in the letter she told her father of her sisters fate and of her own good fortune. the crow carried the news to her father and greatly surprised he read the contents of his daughters letter to his wife. so the brahmin went and spent eight or nine days in the palace. then she gave him another box full of clothes and jewels and money for himself. so saying he went out shut the door and put on the chain. meaning that he should come and share the feast. when he opened the door he found her dead so he packed up his things and returned to his daughter and lived happily ever after. he and his old mother lived together and sometimes when he felt lonely he would walk out and call in two or three men any passing strangers whom he chanced to meet and ask them to come in and have a talk and smoke with him. when they left his house he never expected to see them again. asked the king. the servants did as he told them took up the sleeping man and put him to bed in the kings palace. he washed and dressed and went with his vizier to hold court. when he awoke there in the morning he called to his servants but no one answered except his old mother who came and stood beside him. she asked. there he was kept until he ceased to say that he was king and then he was released. said the king. now near the spot where it fell there lived a wicked magician who suddenly appeared before the frightened merchant and told him he was going to kill him. at last the merchant asked that he might be allowed to go home and settle his affairs. to this the magician consented so the merchant departed and spent a last happy year with his wife and children. arrived at the spot he saw an old man who asked him why he came to such a place. i took both the woman and her child to my first wife and asked her to feed and take care of them but she being jealous changed my wife into a cow and my son into a calf. she fell at my feet and looked so unhappy that i could not kill her and sent her away. then my wife grew very angry and insisted upon the sacrifice. at last i consented and the poor cow was killed. he kept it with his other cattle and one day a young girl who saw it began to laugh and cry. one that i may be allowed to marry your son and the other that i may do as i please with your first wife. i was one of three brothers. my father died and we divided his clothes and money amongst us. she consented but when my brothers saw her they grew jealous and as soon as the ship sailed they took her and threw her into the sea and me after her. i begged in vain that she would spare them so at last she consented to punish them in some other way instead of killing them. the third old man began to tell his story. i will restore him again to his former shape. the snake and the frog 
a rajah had two sons. the rajah full of pity threw a stone at the snake and it immediately released the frog which hopped away. the rajah agreed and his new servant followed him. the frog meantime had also gone home and told his wife of the narrow escape he had from the snake and how a man had saved him from its very jaws. so he also took the form of a man and offered himself as a servant to the rajah. then they entered a city belonging to a great king and the three of them offered to work for him. to this the king agreed and they were employed by him. so quickly taking his old form he dived into the water and restored the ring to his master who took it to the king. some time after this the kings daughter was bitten by a snake and in great danger of death. this so delighted the king that he called the young rajah and offered him his daughter in marriage as a reward. so the marriage took place and they lived happily ever afterwards. next time the shoemaker visited his garden he saw a beautiful woman in it and not knowing that she was a fairy asked her to tell him her name and how she came there. even his own mother could not influence him in the matter and so he was released. so all night long the stranger used to pace up and down the palace grounds keeping watch. asked the rajah. so the man turned to do his bidding. outside the garden gate sat a figure covered and clothed in loose white garments. asked the man. now the rajah who had heard every word of the interview quickly returned to the spot where he had first heard the voice and there awaited his servants return. asked he when he saw him. then the rajah left him and ordered him to appear at his court the following day. that night when he began to cry and howl it was at once discovered that he was only a jackal so all the animals ran at him bit him and turned him out. the enchanted bird music and stream 
there was once a prince who used to amuse himself by dressing as a poor man and going about amongst his subjects without their finding out who he was. in this way he found out all that they did and how they lived. the prince went home and next day while holding court gave an order that these three sisters should be brought to him. the order was immediately carried out and as the three trembling girls stood before him they wondered much why they had been summoned. terribly alarmed the eldest confessed that she had said she would like to be the wife of one of the servants so as to get nice things to eat. the second said she had wished to be the wife of his cook. he then ordered the one to be married to one of his servants and the other to his cook but the third he married himself. the baby they put into a box and flung into the river. yet a third child was born to the princess a little girl which the two sisters changed for a rat. as before they placed the child in a box and threw it into the river and yet a third time did the gardener rescue the babe and take it to grow up with its two brothers his adopted boys. by this time the prince was very angry with his wife and turned her out of his house. the gardener and his wife who had loved their adopted children very dearly died when the boys were about eight or nine years of age. the brothers often went out hunting and on one occasion when they were out and their sister alone at home a very old woman came to her and begged for some water. she willingly gave it and then asked the old woman very kindly if she would not come in and rest. on the return of her brothers they asked her why she looked so sad and she told them of the old womans visit and what she had said. then he mounted his horse and rode away. on the way he met an old fakir. this old mans face was covered with hair so that he could not see and he had a very long grey beard. this so startled the boy that he looked round and in a moment was turned into stone. on this her second brother said he would go and seek him and also find the three things she required for her house. then he mounted his steed and started on his journey. then the fakir gave him also a ball of string with the same directions which he had given his brother and he continued on his journey. on and on went she until she saw a cage hanging on a tree and in it a bird. then she filled a vessel with water and prepared to return but very sorrowfully for she had found both her brothers turned into stone. this she did and to her great surprise both the lads came to life. they were delighted to see her and to know that she had succeeded in finding the gifts they had failed to get and the three returned home and lived very happily together for some time. one day the two brothers thought they would like to go out hunting again. now they did not know that an order had been passed that nobody was to hunt in that forest except the prince and while they were there they came face to face with the prince himself. then they explained that they were in ignorance of his orders when they came and begged forgiveness. then the prince invited them to his palace but they said they could go nowhere without first telling their sister. on the third day they met the prince again and he asked why they had not come but they pleaded as an excuse that they had forgotten to ask their sister. that night as they were going to bed the small golden ball rolled out on the floor and seeing it they remembered and told their sister of the princes invitation. one day soon after this the bird advised the sister of the boys to invite the prince to dinner. said she. so the girl did as she was told and sent a man to dig. the prince accepted the invitation to dinner and came to the house. this she very gladly did and returned with him to the palace where her children received her and they were all very happy ever after. the two wicked sisters were killed by order of the prince. the necklace and dog were then left as security and the man went his way. he noticed how beautiful she was and stopped his elephant to ask who she was. this man had great riches and lands and also owned a place of worship. asked she. in the morning when the sun shone and people woke up lo there was a large pond in place of the hole and nothing was seen of the unfortunate children. moral. thus there is a cause for everything in the world. do not the maidens of my court please thee he had proceeded a good distance when night fell and he found himself in a forest near a small hut. entering it he found it was occupied by a holy fakir. where are you going then the young prince was turned into a parrot and immediately flew off. the dragons came up and took away the fruit but left the burnt body of the bird upon the ground. the fakir waited long for the return of the parrot but as it did not come he set out himself to find it. he was able to cross in safety by making his body invisible and when he came to the island the first thing he saw was the burnt body of the parrot lying in the garden. thus saying he disappeared and the parrot watching its chance very silently approached the tree a second time stole the fruit and flew as fast as he could. the young prince then mounted his steed and thanked the old fakir for all his assistance. then the fairy lifted his head very gently and placing it on her knee allowed him to sleep on. hearing that this was so she was filled with envy and planned in her mind how she might take the life of the fairy. the fairy bent forward to see herself and as she did so the young woman pushed her so that she fell into the well and sank into the water. he asked his servants to hook it out for him but each time they tried to do so the flower disappeared beneath the water. at last he tried himself to get it and succeeded easily for the lily floated towards the hook that he let down. the prince took the flower home and looked after it with the greatest care but when his wife heard where it had come from she went at night and tearing it into several pieces flung it out of the window. they gave her shelter and fed her the gardeners daughter loving her as a sister and the gardener as a father. she therefore begged for the heart of the girl who lived in the gardeners hut and orders were given for her execution. before they killed her she begged that her limbs might be scattered to the four winds and her two eyes thrown upwards into space. the sentence passed upon her was that she was to be buried alive near the well this was done and to this day nobody dare go near it. the monster seemed to be asleep and as it breathed fire and smoke came out of its nostrils. he had only gone a few steps when he heard some one calling him from behind. where had the dragon gone in such a short space of time or had it transformed itself into this man and what did the whole thing mean if it goes on much longer like this not only shall i lose all my children but i myself must fall a victim to the monster. but all who came this way as soon as they saw me were terrified and ran away as fast as they could. you are the first man i have found able to look at me without fear so i knew at once that you were a man of great courage. i beg you to have pity upon me. as if a mighty army had begun to march not far away. the dragon king stood by the warriors side trembling with fear. those two balls of fire are its eyes. it is coming for its prey he tried to calm the dragon king. he looked across the waters. this was so monstrous that even to think of such a creature made one creep with horror. at last the dreadful night was over. the presents that they carried were as follows
   first a large bronze bell. second a bag of rice. third a roll of silk. fourth a cooking pot. fifth a bell. the warriors household and servants had been very much concerned when they found that he did not return the night before but they finally concluded that he had been kept by the violent storm and had taken shelter somewhere. the presents which he had received from the grateful dragon king were found to be of magic power. the cooking pot was wonderful too. long long ago in japan there lived an old man and his wife. he was out most of the day at work in the fields and as he had no child for his amusement when he came home he kept a tame sparrow. he loved the little bird just as much as if she had been his child. when he came back at night after his hard days work in the open air it was his only pleasure to pet the sparrow to talk to her and to teach her little tricks which she learned very quickly. the old man would open her cage and let her fly about the room and they would play together. i thought it was some food put out for me in that basin and i ate it all. if i have made a mistake i beg you to forgive me but not so. in the evening the old man came home. but tonight the old man was very disappointed for not even the shadow of his dear sparrow was to be seen. still no sparrow was to be seen. i am sure i dont know. now i come to think of it i havent seen her all the afternoon. oh was all that the old man could answer. he said to himself. the old man shed many tears after his cross wife had gone to sleep. while he wiped away the tears with the sleeve of his cotton robe a bright thought comforted him he would go and look for the sparrow on the morrow. having decided this he was able to go to sleep at last. she bowed her little head and went through a number of the tricks her master had taught her to show her pleasure at seeing her old friend again and wonderful to relate she could talk as of old. the old man told her how sorry he was for all that had happened and inquired after her tongue wondering how she could speak so well without it. then the sparrow opened her beak and showed him that a new tongue had grown in place of the old one and begged him not to think any more about the past for she was quite well now. then the old man knew that his sparrow was a fairy and no common bird. and above all she was a fairy. the old man was utterly astonished when he entered the house to find what a beautiful place it was. the sparrow led the old man to the place of honor and then taking her place at a humble distance she thanked him with many polite bows for all the kindness he had shown her for many long years. then the lady sparrow as we will now call her introduced all her family to the old man. never had the old man enjoyed himself so much. but the night came on and the darkness reminded him that he had a long way to go and must think about taking his leave and return home. he told the lady sparrow that it was a great comfort and happiness to him to find her in such a beautiful home and to know that she wanted for nothing. now he knew that all was well he could return home with a light heart. if ever she wanted him for anything she had only to send for him and he would come at once. but now that he knew where the lady sparrow lived he would come to see her whenever he had the time. when the lady sparrow saw that she could not persuade the old man to stay longer she gave an order to some of her servants and they at once brought in two boxes one large and the other small. indeed she only felt sorrow for the old man who had to put up with it all his life. she asked in a big voice. and they both sat down before the box and opened it. many times. just think what we have lost. we might have had twice as much silver and gold as this. she screamed and then went to bed as angry as she could be. early the next morning she got up and made the old man describe the way to the sparrows house. when he saw what was in her mind he tried to keep her from going but it was useless. she would not listen to one word he said. it is strange that the old woman did not feel ashamed of going to see the sparrow after the cruel way she had treated her in cutting off her tongue in a fit of rage. they all loved the old man who was so kind and good and patient under all his troubles but the old woman they hated and they determined if ever they had the chance to punish her as she deserved. they had not long to wait. she hastened to the door and knocked loudly. the lady sparrow at once consented and told her servants to bring out the big box. the box was so heavy that she could not walk fast much less run as she would have liked to do so anxious was she to get home and see what was inside the box but she had often to sit down and rest herself by the way. she could wait no longer for she supposed this big box to be full of gold and silver and precious jewels like the small one her husband had received. what she saw however so terrified her that she nearly lost her senses. when she reached home she fell to the floor and told her husband with tears all that had happened to her and how she had been nearly killed by the demons in the box. but in the little fishing village more than for being a clever fisher of the sea was he known for his kind heart. one soft summer twilight he was going home at the end of a days fishing when he came upon a group of children. now urashima felt very sorry for the poor tortoise and made up his mind to rescue it. we do not. urashima waited a moment turning over in his mind what would be the best way to deal with the boys. now wont you give me the tortoise you can do much more with this money than you can with that poor tortoise. poor thing there there you are safe now they say that a stork lives for a thousand years but the tortoise for ten thousand years. now i am going to take you back to your home the sea at once. the next morning urashima went out as usual in his boat. he soon passed the other fishing boats and left them behind him till they were lost to sight in the distance and his boat drifted further and further out upon the blue waters. clear as a bell and soft as the summer wind the name floated over the sea. startled and wondering who or what it was that had called him so clearly he looked in all directions round about him and saw that without his knowing it a tortoise had come to the side of the boat. come up into the boat. you have never seen the sea kings palace it is far away at the bottom of the sea but if i take you there we shall soon reach the place. you need not swim yourself. try at once as the tortoise finished speaking urashima looked at its shell and strange to say he saw that the creature had suddenly grown so big that a man could easily sit on its back. mr. tortoise with your kind permission i will get on your back. down through the water the tortoise dived. for a long time these two strange companions rode through the sea. and while he was speaking the tortoise reached the side of the gate. i have had the honor of bringing him as a visitor to this kingdom. welcome to the sea palace the home of the dragon king of the sea. thrice welcome are you having come from such a distant country. urashima was lost in wonder while he looked upon her and he could not speak. there is nothing i could wish for more than to be permitted to stay here with you in this beautiful land of which i have often heard but have never seen to this day. urashima enjoyed himself with all his heart. never in his whole life had he sat down to such a marvelous feast. when the feast was over the princes asked the bridegroom if he would like to walk through the palace and see all there was to be seen. then the happy fisherman following his bride the sea kings daughter was shown all the wonders of that enchanted land where youth and joy go hand in hand and neither time nor age can touch them. but to urashima more wonderful than the palace was the garden that surrounded it. i must not stay on here for i have an old father and mother at home. what can have happened to them all this time how anxious they must have been these days when i did not return as usual. and he began to prepare for the journey in great haste. but now i must say goodby. where is the haste do not think that i wish to leave you. it is not that. i must go and see my old parents. you must not open this box whatever happens if you open it something dreadful will happen to you and urashima promised that he would never never open the box whatever happened. he quickly mounted the creatures back and was carried away over the shining sea into the east. then with his face turned eagerly towards his own land he looked for the rising of the blue hills on the horizon before him. at last the tortoise carried him into the bay he knew so well and to the shore from whence he had set out. he stepped on to the shore and looked about him while the tortoise rode away back to the sea kings realm. the shore is the same and the hills are the same but the people that he sees walking past him have very different faces to those he had known so well before. wondering what it can mean he walks quickly towards his old home. and he was about to enter when he saw a strange man coming out. somehow he began to feel strangely anxious he could not tell why. till four or five days ago i lived on this spot. said urashima. he stood looking all around him terribly puzzled and indeed something in the appearance of everything was different to what he remembered before he went away and the awful feeling came over him that what the man said was perhaps true. he seemed to be in a strange dream. the few days he had spent in the sea kings palace beyond the sea had not been days at all they had been hundreds of years and in that time his parents had died and all the people he had ever known and the village had written down his story. there was no use in staying here any longer. he must get back to his beautiful wife beyond the sea. he made his way back to the beach carrying in his hand the box which the princess had given him. but which was the way he could not find it alone there is nothing else for me to do now. and what did he find urashima who had been till that moment like a strong and handsome youth of twentyfour suddenly became very very old. poor urashima the farmer and the badger 
long long ago there lived an old farmer and his wife who had made their home in the mountains far from any town. so he lay in wait day after day and night after night with a big club hoping to catch the badger but all in vain. the badger was in great distress for he did not at all like the idea of being made into soup that night and he thought and thought for a long time trying to hit upon some plan by which he might escape. she looked tired and old. wont you let me do that for you i am so tired and sore tied up like this. the old woman had a good and simple nature and could not think badly of any one. she felt sorry too for the animal as she turned to look at him. he then killed her and cut her up and made soup of her and waited for the return of the old farmer. towards sunset he left his work and turned to go home. he was very tired but the thought of the nice supper of hot badger soup awaiting his return cheered him. the thought that the badger might get free and take revenge on the poor old woman never once came into his mind. the innocent man never even dreamed that it was not his wife but the badger who was waiting upon him and asked at once for the soup. the old man was left behind alone. he could hardly believe what he had seen and heard. after a while he came round and burst into tears. he cried loudly and bitterly. and oh the horrible thought he had very nearly drunk the soup which the creature had made of his poor old woman. now not far away there lived in the same mountain a kind goodnatured old rabbit. he heard the old man crying and sobbing and at once set out to see what was the matter and if there was anything he could do to help his neighbor. the old man told him all that had happened. the next day the weather was fine and the rabbit went out to find the badger. he was not to be seen in the woods or on the hillside or in the fields anywhere so the rabbit went to his den and found the badger hiding there for the animal had been afraid to show himself ever since he had escaped from the farmers house for fear of the old mans wrath. the rabbit led the way miles away from their homes out on the hills where the grass grew tall and thick and sweet. they both set to work to cut down as much as they could carry home to store it up for their winters food. this time the rabbit made the badger go first. when they had gone a little way the rabbit took out a flint and steel and striking it over the badgers back as he stepped along in front set his bundle of grass on fire. the fire soon spread in the bundle of dry grass on the badgers back. by this time the bundle was nearly burned out and all the hair had been burned off the badgers back. he now knew what had happened by the smell of the smoke of the burning grass. screaming with pain the badger ran as fast as he could to his hole. said the rabbit. the rabbit went away glad and smiling to think that the punishment upon the badger had already begun. during the conversation the rabbit mentioned that he was going fishing and described how pleasant fishing was when the weather was fine and the sea smooth. the badger listened with pleasure to the rabbits account of the way he passed his time now and forgot all his pains and his months illness and thought what fun it would be if he could go fishing too so he asked the rabbit if he would take him the next time he went out to fish. this was just what the rabbit wanted so he agreed. then he went home and built two boats one of wood and the other of clay. at last they were both finished and as the rabbit stood and looked at his work he felt that all his trouble would be well rewarded if his plan succeeded and he could manage to kill the wicked badger now. the day came when the rabbit had arranged to take the badger fishing. he kept the wooden boat himself and gave the badger the clay boat. the badger who knew nothing about boats was delighted with his new boat and thought how kind it was of the rabbit to give it to him. they both got into their boats and set out. the badger fell in with the proposal and they both set to work to row as fast as they could for some time. he cried out in great fear to the rabbit to help him. thus at last he kept his promise to the old farmer. the old farmer thanked him with tears in his eyes. he begged the rabbit to stay with him and share his home so from this day the rabbit went to stay with the old farmer and they both lived together as good friends to the end of their days. this was a kind of chariot with the figure of a man on it always pointing to the south. the battle began in earnest. one day he stepped forth from his tent and after walking about for a short time he came to a pond. here he sat down on the bank and was lost in thought. it was autumn. it did so at last and was soon floating over the water to the other side of the pond. when he found that it was a success he set all his men to make more and in time there were enough boats for the whole army. he gained a complete victory and so put an end to the war which had troubled his country for so long. he was beloved by his subjects who now enjoyed their happiness of peace for many long years under him. the dragon approached and bowed down its head before the emperor. this is a messenger from heaven. and they all ran and caught hold of the dragons beard and tried to mount him. but it was impossible for so many people to ride on the dragon. several of them hung on to the creatures beard so that when it tried to mount the hair was pulled out and they fell to the ground. after some time a bow and an arrow dropped to the earth in the courtyard of the palace. now he fell in love with a beautiful lady and married her. you can imagine how strong he was he was very fond of the deer too and would often put his arms round the creatures neck to show that its long horns did not frighten him. great was the fun they all had together. answered the deer. this to the monkey who has a red back in japan. called out the deer. the hare at last gained on the monkey. the poor monkey sat up rubbing his back and his face was very long as he screamed angrily. my foot slipped and i tumbled. now as every one knows the monkey is a cunning animal by nature and he made up his mind to get the best of the hare this time if it were possible. this he soon managed to do. the deer with long horns and the hare with long ears it must have been an amusing sight to those who watched this queer match. suddenly the deer went down on one of his knees and the bear with the leaf on high declared him beaten. now we will all go home. after walking some little distance they came out on the banks of a river flowing through a valley. bridge there was none. all the animals looked serious wondering how they could cross the stream and get home that evening. the bear the deer the monkey and the hare looked at him to see what he would do now. at last he stopped in front of a very large tree that was growing at the waters edge. he took hold of the trunk and pulled it with all his might once twice thrice the four animals followed. he rubbed his eyes to be sure that he was not dreaming when he saw this boy pull over a tree by the roots and throw it across the stream to form a bridge. whose son can he be he hastened after the strange party and crossed the bridge behind them. said his mother with a bright smile glad to see her boy home safe after the long day. i feared that something had happened to you. asked his mother pretending not to know. asked his mother again. they both exclaimed. said the woodcutter. hardly able to believe what i saw i followed you home. because of his great strength as an infant i hid him away in this unknown part of the country for he hurt every one that came near him. to tell you the truth i am no woodcutter joy but she hid her grief with a strong face as they say in japan. when they learned that he was going away for good they followed him to the foot of the mountain to see him off. then they all climbed a tree to see the last of him and from that height they watched him and his shadow gradually grow smaller and smaller till he was lost to sight. he was by far the strongest of them all. he immediately started off delighted at the prospect of trying his sword. he now kept his promise and built a comfortable home for his old mother who lived happily with him in the capital to the end of her days. is not this the story of a great hero a story of old japan. they had however one cause for great sorrow for as the years went by no child was born to them. and their prayer was answered. though i die you must grow up a good girl. do your best not to give trouble to your nurse or any other of your family. perhaps your father will marry again and some one will fill my place as your mother. dont forget this. very different in character alas when she was twelve years of age she could play so beautifully that she and her stepmother were summoned to the palace to perform before the emperor. into another similar bottle she poured some good wine. all his toys of warriors and heroes were spread out and she was telling him wonderful stories about each of them. they were both enjoying themselves and laughing merrily with their attendants when his mother entered with the two bottles of wine and some delicious cakes. all this time she was anxiously watching the little princess but to her amazement no change whatever took place in the young girls face. the attendants rushed for the doctor but nothing could save the child he died within the hour in his mothers arms. strange indeed it seemed to all those standing round. the waters ceased their roaring and the river was quiet in direct answer to her prayer. after this the emperor soon recovered his health. that one was her stepmother. he would listen to none of her tales telling her sharply that she was quite mistaken. she invented a dreadful story about the little princess saying that this was the only way to prevent disgrace falling upon the family by killing her. with the help of some peasants he soon built a little cottage and having sent secretly for his wife to come these two good old people did all in their power to take care of the now unfortunate princess. she all the time trusted in her father knowing that as soon as he returned home and found her absent he would search for her. he was nearly ill with anxiety. one day trying to forget his terrible worry he called all his men together and told them to make ready for a several days hunt in the mountains. they were soon ready and mounted waiting at the gate for their lord. as he drew nearer his surprise increased for he could see that the reader was a beautiful girl. she was so intent on what she was saying that she neither heard nor saw her father till he spoke. he gave up the hunt at once and hurried home with his daughter. she was no longer troubled by an unkind stepmother and her days passed happily and quietly with her father. the story of the man who did not wish to die. long long ago there lived a man called sentaro. one day without any reason whatsoever the thought of death and sickness came to him. the idea of falling ill or dying made him very wretched. he could not get away from it. whoever drank of this wonderful draught lived forever. the crane grew large enough for him to ride on it with comfort. it then spread its wings rose high in the air and flew away over the mountains right out to sea. sentaro was at first quite frightened but by degrees he grew accustomed to the swift flight through the air. on and on they went for thousands of miles. after several days they reached an island. as soon as sentaro got down from the birds back the crane folded up of its own accord and flew into his pocket. he walked first round about the country and then through the town. everything was of course quite strange and different from his own land. he had wished to escape from dying. these they swallowed eagerly hoping for death to come so that they might go to paradise. he never saw any one ill after eating these horrible things nor did he ever see any one with as much as a cold. sentaro was delighted. he was the only happy man on the island. for his part he wished to live thousands of years and to enjoy life. he set himself up in business and for the present never even dreamed of going back to his native land. this caused him great annoyance. time passed like the flight of an arrow for him for he was busy from morning till night. no sooner did he pray than the paper crane popped out of his pocket. once more the bird grew and grew till it was large enough for him to mount it. as he did so the bird spread its wings and flew swiftly out across the sea in the direction of japan. he tried to stop the bird in vain. the crane held on its way for thousands of miles across the ocean. sentaro fell with it. he looked round but there was no ship in sight. suddenly a bright light came towards him and in the light stood a messenger. but you grew weary of living there and begged to be allowed to return to your native land so that you might die. the angel disappeared as soon as he had finished speaking and sentaro took the lesson to heart. he was very poor and sad also for no child had heaven sent to cheer his old age and in his heart there was no hope of rest from work till he died and was laid in the quiet grave. for three days the festival was kept up with song and dance and music. then they approached the house and tried to speak to the old man and his wife or some of the servants but not even this was granted them. still in spite of all this disappointment they stayed on day after day and night after night and counted it as nothing so great was their desire to see the princess. at last however most of the men seeing how hopeless their quest was lost heart and hope both and returned to their homes. in this hopeless state the winter passed. the snow and frost and the cold winds gradually gave place to the gentle warmth of spring. thus several days passed but even so they could not rest in their homes. then he told her how anxious he was to see her safely and happily married before he died. so i have always thought that you were more than mortal woman. while i am alive it is right for you to remain as you are if you wish to do so but some day i shall cease to be and who will take care of you then then the princess answered that she felt sure that she was not as beautiful as perhaps report made her out to be and that even if she consented to marry any one of them not really knowing her before his heart might change afterwards. so as she did not feel sure of them even though her father told her they were worthy knights she did not feel it wise to see them. then princess moonlight said she must make further trial of their love before she would grant their request to interview her. the five warriors were to prove their love by each bringing her from distant countries something that she desired to possess. then he gave them her message that she would consent to marry whosoever was successful in bringing her what she wanted. this was to test them. the roots of this tree were of silver the trunk of gold and the branches bore as fruit white jewels. the fifth knight was to find the swallow which carried a shell in its stomach and to bring the shell to her. he then wrapped it in a cloth of gold and waiting quietly for three years returned and carried it to the old man. princess moonlight wondered that the knight should have returned so soon. she returned it at once and refused to see him. the knight threw the bowl away and returned to his home in despair. the second knight told his parents that he needed change of air for his health for he was ashamed to tell them that love for the princess moonlight was the real cause of his leaving them. so he tried to persuade the princess to consent to see the man. but she remained silent and looked very sad. the old man began to take out the branch and praised it as a wonderful treasure to be found nowhere in the whole land. princess moonlight took the branch in her hand and looked at it carefully. our food gave out and we suffered much from sickness on board. on nearer approach this proved to be an island in the center of which rose a high mountain. i landed and after wandering about for two or three days i saw a shining being coming towards me on the beach holding in his hands a golden bowl. the wonders of that strange land are many and if i began to tell you about them i could never stop. in spite of my wish to stay there long on breaking off the branch i hurried back. the virtue of any part of this animal was that no fire could harm it. he promised his friend any amount of money he liked to ask if only he could get him the desired article. as soon as the news came that the ship on which his friend had sailed home had come into port he rode seven days on horseback to meet him. when he reached home he put it carefully in a box and sent it in to the princess while he waited outside for her answer. if it were the real thing it would not burn. so the third knight failed also. the knight became desperate. he thought that it was quite probable she had wished to kill him so that she might be rid of him and in order to carry out her wish had sent him upon his impossible quest. their master told them that he was heartily sick of adventure and said that he never intended to go near the princesss house again in the future. like all the rest the fifth knight failed in his quest he could not find the swallows shell. he sent word to the old man of his intention and he received consent to the scheme. when princess moonlight became aware that a stranger was looking at her she tried to escape from the room but the emperor caught her and begged her to listen to what he had to say. her only answer was to hide her face in her sleeves. the emperor fell deeply in love with her and begged her to come to the court where he would give her a position of honor and everything she could wish for. but the princess stopped him. she said that if she were forced to go to the palace she would turn at once into a shadow and even as she spoke she began to lose her form. her figure faded from his sight while he looked. so he bade her goodby and left the house with a sad heart. princess moonlight was for him the most beautiful woman in the world all others were dark beside her and he thought of her night and day. these little songs always gave him pleasure. with many tears she told him that he had guessed rightly when he supposed her not to belong to this world that she had in truth come from the moon and that her time on earth would soon be over. the men returned and told his majesty all that had passed. the night wore on then the night grew gray towards the dawn and all hoped that the danger was over that princess moonlight would not have to leave them after all. nearer and nearer it came and every one saw with dismay that its course lay towards the house. she committed a grave fault and as a punishment was sent to live down here for a time. the messenger led her forth and placed her in the chariot. she looked back and saw with pity the deep sorrow of the old man. she swallowed a little and was about to give the rest to the old man but she was prevented from doing so. i must not forget my good friend the emperor. princess moonlights letter was carried to the palace. when this story begins they had been married for some years and were blessed with one little daughter. now that she was seven years of age and had learned to talk and to wait upon her parents in those several little ways so dear to the hearts of fond parents their cup of happiness seemed full. one day there was much excitement in the home for the father had been suddenly summoned to the capital on business. the roads were rough and bad and ordinary people had to walk every step of the way whether the distance were one hundred or several hundred miles. all was ready at last and the husband stood in the porch with his little family round him. the little girl was the only one to smile for she was ignorant of the sorrow of parting and did not know that going to the capital was at all different from walking to the next village which her father did very often. she ran to his side and caught hold of his long sleeve to keep him a moment. as the father turned to take a last look at his weeping wife and smiling eager child he felt as if some one were pulling him back by the hair so hard was it for him to leave them behind for they had never been separated before. i know for i asked him to bring you a doll. it seemed to the mother as she looked at the childs face that her love for her grew deeper and deeper. then she set to work to make the winter clothes for the three of them. in the intervals of her work she directed the little girls games and taught her to read the old stories of her country. it would have been difficult for any one who did not know the man well to recognize him. both the man and his wife rejoiced to find each other well. what i have brought you is called a mirror and whoever looks into its clear surface can see their own form reflected there. although there are none to be found in this out of the way place yet they have been in use in the capital from the most ancient times. the wife listened to all her husband told her and was pleased at learning so much that was new to her. she was still more pleased at the precious gift his token of remembrance while he had been away. it seemed to the little family as if they had not known what true happiness was before so glad were they to be together again and this evening the father had much to tell of his journey and of all he had seen at the great capital. but alas so at last the happiness of this family was broken up by a great sorrow. the good and gentle wife and mother was one day taken ill.
in the first days of her illness the father and daughter thought that it was only a cold and were not particularly anxious. but in spite of all their efforts the womans life was not to be saved. i am sure that nothing can save me now. this i give you before i die. with these words the dying woman handed the mirror to her daughter. the mind of the good mother seemed to be now at rest and sinking back without another word her spirit passed quietly away that day. in spite of this the daughters life seemed to her desolate. her love for her dead mother did not grow less with time and so keen was her remembrance that everything in daily life even the falling of the rain and the blowing of the wind reminded her of her mothers death and of all that they had loved and shared together. she threw herself down in her mothers room and wept as if her heart would break. suddenly she sat up. my mother told me when she gave me the mirror as a parting gift that whenever i looked into it i should be able to meet her to see her. she dried her eyes quickly and going to the cupboard took out the box that contained the mirror her heart beating with expectation as she lifted the mirror out and gazed into its smooth face. behold her mothers words were true in the round mirror before her she saw her mothers face but oh the joyful surprise she knows how miserable i am without her and she has come to comfort me. a year spent in mourning had thus passed away in the little household when by the advice of his relations the man married again and the daughter now found herself under the authority of a stepmother. the woman soon saw that he began to show more concern for his lonely child than before. so crooked did the womans heart become. the woman herself was a little frightened too at what she had seen. no the husband listened to the dreadful tale but he could not believe his gentle daughter guilty of such an evil act. the thing was impossible. yet he remembered having noticed that his daughter stayed much in her room of late and kept herself away from every one even when visitors came to the house. putting this fact together with his wifes alarm he thought that there might be something to account for the strange story. he decided to go at once to his daughter and try to find out the truth. the girl had for a long time past been very unhappy. but she soon found that her efforts were in vain. morning and evening she wept over the remembrance. it was the only comfort that she had in these wretched days. her father found her occupied in this way. looking over her shoulder to see who was entering her room the girl was surprised to see her father for he generally sent for her when he wished to speak to her. she was also confused at being found looking at the mirror for she had never told any one of her mothers last promise but had kept it as the sacred secret of her heart. so before turning to her father she slipped the mirror into her long sleeve. never had he spoken to her in such a tone. what evil spirit has taken possession of your heart that you should be so wicked you have certainly changed my daughter but she saw that she must speak and clear herself somehow. she loved her father dearly and could not bear the idea of his anger. father do not say such dreadful things to me. indeed i am. however stupid i may be i should never be able to curse any one who belonged to you much less pray for the death of one you love. he wished to clear up his doubts once for all. so she slipped the mirror out from her long sleeve and laid it before him. and so you have kept it all this time then she told him of her mothers last words and of how she had promised to meet her child whenever she looked into the glass. but still the father could not understand the simplicity of his daughters character in not knowing that what she saw reflected in the mirror was in reality her own face and not that of her mother. he asked. she asked earnestly looking up into his face. at last i understand. you are truly a faithful child. living in constant remembrance of your lost mother has helped you to grow like her in character. how clever it was of her to tell you to do this. and here the father wept. he thought of how lonely the poor girl must have been and of all that she must have suffered under her stepmothers treatment. the stepmother anxious to know what would happen had all this while been standing outside the room. she exclaimed in broken tones. i shall think of you as a child that i have borne myself. from this time on the three lived together as happily as fish in water. her patience and goodness were rewarded at last. one day as the sun was setting a priest came to the plain. he had apparently lost his way and as it was late he met no one who could show him the road or warn him of the haunted spot. i am a traveler please excuse me but i have lost my way and do not know what to do for i have nowhere to rest tonight. you must indeed be distressed to have lost your way in such a lonely spot so late at night. and in this way he pressed the old woman to let him stay. the old woman then brought some sticks of wood and lit the fire and bade her guest draw near and warm himself. she then went to the kitchen to cook some rice. at last the wood gave out and as the fire died slowly down he began to shiver with cold just as he had done when he arrived. then she left him and went out. the old woman then went out again and the priest was left alone. the fire had died out and the only light in the hut was that of a dim lantern. what hidden thing could be in that room that she did not wish him to see for some time the remembrance of his promise to the old woman kept him still but at last he could no longer resist his curiosity to peep into the forbidden place. he got up and began to move slowly towards the back room. as the minutes went slowly by and the old woman did not return he began to feel more and more frightened and to wonder what dreadful secret was in the room behind him. he must find out. in one corner skull upon skull rose to the ceiling in another was a heap of arm bones in another a heap of leg bones. he cried out. as he ran he heard the steps behind him come nearer and nearer and at last he recognized the old womans voice which grew louder and louder as she came nearer. the priest quite forgot how tired he was and his feet flew over the ground faster than ever. and after him rushed the dreadful old hag her hair flying in the wind and her face changing with rage into the demon that she was. he then set forward for another part of the country only too glad to leave the haunted plain behind him. one evening the man came home in a very bad temper and told his wife to send for the butcher the next morning. i beat him with my stick all i know how but he wont dance properly. i must now sell him to the butcher and make what money out of him i can. now the monkey was in the next room and overheard every word of the conversation. woe is me what am i to do. ah a bright thought has struck me there is i know a wild bear living in the forest near by. i have often heard tell of his wisdom. there was no time to lose. the monkey slipped out of the house and ran as quickly as he could to the forest to find the boar. the boar was at home and the monkey began his tale of woe at once. i am in great trouble you alone can help me. what do you advise me to do said the monkey. the monkey thanked the boar many times and then went home. he did not sleep much that night as you may imagine for thinking of the morrow. he was the first up waiting anxiously for what was to happen. then all happened as the boar had planned. suddenly there was a noise in the porch and a loud cry from the child. by the time that the man was alive to what had happened and they both got outside the gate the boar had got well away but they saw the monkey running after the thief as hard as his legs would carry him. said the wife. would it not be wise for us to make a change your idea is not a bad one at all. drawing up his line for the last time before going home he found that he had lost his hook without even knowing when he had dropped it. asked the elder brother impatiently. it is just what i expected. and you have done badly. i will not return you your bow and arrow till you have found my hook. he was at last obliged to give up all hope of finding it. he took these to his angry brother and offered them to him asking his forgiveness and begging him to accept them in the place of the one he had lost for him. it was useless his brother would not listen to him much less grant his request. he was much cast down for he had lost all hope of ever finding his brothers hook now. while he stood on the beach lost in perplexity and wondering what he had best do next an old man suddenly appeared carrying a stick in his hand. the happy hunter afterwards remembered that he did not see from whence the old man came neither did he know how he was there he happened to look up and saw the old man coming towards him. asked the old man. i have hunted this shore all over but alas i cannot find it and i am very troubled for my brother wont forgive me till i restore it to him. i am sorry to hear what misfortune has befallen you. you must indeed be anxious. asked the distressed man. the old man at once set to work and soon made a basket and offered it to the happy hunter. he received it with joy and taking it to the water mounted it and prepared to start. he bade good by to the kind old man who had helped him so much and told him that he would certainly reward him as soon as he found his hook and could return to japan without fear of his brothers anger. the happy hunter made all the haste he could riding on the basket which had been given him by his friend. our hero had often heard of the wonders of the sea kings palace beneath the sea but all the stories he had ever heard fell short of the reality which he now saw for the first time. the happy hunter would have liked to enter the gate there and then but he saw that it was fast closed and also that there was no one about whom he could ask to open it for him so he stopped to think what he should do. in the shade of the trees before the gate he noticed a well full of fresh spring water. surely some one would come out to draw water from the well some time he thought. ere long he saw the huge gate swing open and two beautiful women came out. he said not a word however but silently gazed at them through the foliage of the trees waiting to see what they would do. they gazed at him face to face but their tongues were still with wonder and could not find a word to say to him. so i climbed into the tree much vexed and waited for some one to come. he received it from them with both hands raising it to the height of his forehead in token of high respect and pleasure and then drank the water quickly for his thirst was great. unless i find it again i can never hope to win my brothers forgiveness for he is very angry at what i have done. i have searched for it many many times but i cannot find it therefore i am much troubled. this kind old man also showed me how to come. now you know how it is i am here and why. will you be so kind as to take me to your father asked the happy hunter anxiously. the dragon king of the sea was much surprised at the news for it was but seldom perhaps only once in several hundred years that the sea kings palace was visited by mortals. he then ordered them all to the entrance of the palace to welcome the happy hunter. and he bowed again and thanked the sea king. a great feast was now spread before the king and his royal guest. the time passed so pleasantly that the happy hunter seemed to forget his trouble and why he had come at all to the sea kings realm and he gave himself up to the enjoyment of this wonderful place the land of fairy fishes who has ever heard of such a marvelous place while he was fishing the other day upon the shore of japan some one robbed him of his brothers fishing hook. he has come all this way down to the bottom of the sea to our kingdom because he thought that one of you fishes may have taken the hook from him in mischievous play. all the fishes were taken by surprise when they heard these words and could say nothing for some time. they sat looking at each other and at the dragon king. asked the king. for this reason i think the hook may be in his throat. will you send for him and inquire into the matter. he led him before the king. he then washed it and brought it to the king. so he begged the sea king to forgive his subject. the years pass swiftly when any one is truly happy. i am indeed very sorry to part from you but this time it cannot be helped. with your gracious permission i will take my leave today. i hope to make you another visit some day. i hope you will not forget us. the two princesses bowed low rose and glided out of the hall. as the happy hunter looked at them he wondered what they could be. we now give them to you as a parting gift in token of our great affection for you. never had he seen such a huge creature. the sea king had ordered the monster to carry the happy hunter back to japan. he earnestly begged his brothers forgiveness telling him all that had happened to him in the sea kings palace and what wonderful adventures had led to the finding of the hook. the happy hunter had a kind heart and could not bear the sight of his brothers distress. from this time he kept his word and became a good man and a kind brother. the story of the old man who made withered trees to flower. their life had been a very happy and peaceful one save for one great sorrow and this was they had no child. he ran back to the house fetched his spade and began to dig the ground at that spot. the old man ran in to call his wife and together they carried home the treasure. thus in one day the poor old man became rich. he began to think that he too would like to find a fortune. you must find them for me where are they where the old mans disgust can be imagined. this soon gave way to anger. then he returned to the house telling no one not even his wife what he had done. day after day went by and the good old man waited in vain. then he went to his neighbor and asked him to give him back his dog. out of the trunk he made a mortar. a strange thing happened his wife put the rice into the mortar and no sooner had he begun to pound it to make the cakes than it began to increase in quantity gradually till it was about five times the original amount and the cakes were turned out of the mortar as if an invisible hand were at work. so from this time they never troubled about food for they lived upon the cakes with which the mortar never ceased to supply them. the old man did not in the least wish to lend it to his cruel neighbor but he was too kind to refuse. he found him sitting by a big fire made of pieces of wood. on the ground lay what looked very much like pieces of a broken mortar. it is a great pity you did not ask me for the cakes if you wanted them. i would have given you as many as ever you wanted. the neighbor consented at once and the old man carried home a basket full of ashes. a wonderful thing happened the story of the old mans garden spread far and wide and people from far and near came to see the wonderful sight. one day soon after this the old man heard some one knocking at his door and going to the porch to see who it was he was surprised to see a knight standing there. at this point fortunately they had heard that there was a wonderful old man who could make withered trees to blossom and that his lord had sent him to ask the old man to come to him. at last he climbed to the spot where the tree divided into two great branches and taking up his position here the old man sat down and scattered the ashes right and left all over the branches and twigs. wonderful indeed was the result the withered tree at once burst into full bloom he himself gave the old man a wine cup filled with the best sake and rewarded him with much silver and gold and many other precious things. i have nothing to do today. the satisfaction of false old man can now be imagined. replied the old man again. but all to no effect. the jelly fish and the monkey. at last he thought that if he married he would not only be happier but also more powerful. so he decided to take a wife. at last they returned to the palace bringing with them a lovely young dragon. the king fell in love with her at once and the wedding ceremony was celebrated with great splendor. now for a time the dragon king and his bride lived very happily. life seemed to them both like a long summers day. two months passed in this happy way and then the dragon queen fell ill and was obliged to stay in bed. asked the dragon king. said the doctor. answered the doctor. asked the king. then the doctor told the dragon king that some distance to the south there was a monkey island where a great many monkeys lived. said the doctor. said the dragon king greatly puzzled. he is certainly ugly to look at but he is proud of being able to walk on land with his four legs like a tortoise. the jelly fish was then summoned to the kings presence and was told by his majesty what was required of him. tell him that you are a servant of the dragon king and invite him to come and visit you and see the dragon kings palace. thought the jelly fish. in those ancient days the jelly fish had four legs and a hard shell like a tortoise. i am one of the servants of the dragon king. answered the monkey. it is a great pity for you to go through life without seeing it. asked the monkey in astonishment. the monkey grew more and more interested and as he listened he came down the tree step by step so as not to lose a word of the wonderful story. i must now go back. asked the monkey. then the jelly fish seeing how anxious the monkey looked was sorry for him and told him everything. said the silly jelly fish. he trembled with fear at the thought of what was in store for him. but the monkey was a clever animal and he thought it the wisest plan not to show any sign of the fear he felt so he tried to calm himself and to think of some way by which he might escape. thought the monkey. if i had only guessed of what you were in need. i should have presented you with one without waiting to be asked. asked the jelly fish. today listening to your interesting conversation i quite forgot it and left it behind when i came off with you. the jelly fish was very disappointed when he heard this for he believed every word the monkey said. finally the jelly fish stopped and told the monkey so. thus persuaded the jelly fish turned his course towards the monkey island once more. answered the monkey. the last thing he heard as he glided away leaving the island behind him was the monkey laughing at him. when they caught sight of him approaching the palace they hailed him with delight. the dragon kings wrath was great and he at once gave orders that the jelly fish was to be severely punished. the punishment was a horrible one. all the bones were to be drawn out from his living body and he was to be beaten with sticks. but the dragon kings order had to be obeyed. the quarrel of the monkey and the crab. if only i could show it to you then with the yellow fruit hanging on its branches he at last gave in and consented to the monkeys proposal and the exchange was made. in the following spring the crab was delighted to see the shoot of a young tree push its way up through the ground. he said to himself. he determined to ask the monkey to help him and set out to find him. he was soon wide awake however when he heard himself called and eagerly listening to what the crab told him. he consented to go with the crab to pick the fruit for him. he was so disappointed that he ran round and round the tree calling to the monkey to remember his promise. when the wicked monkey saw that he had killed the crab he ran away from the spot as fast as he could in fear and trembling like a coward as he was. now the crab had a son who had been playing with a friend not far from the spot where this sad work had taken place. at this dreadful sight the poor young crab sat down and wept. alas he at first thought of going to attack the monkey at once for he burned with rage. second thoughts however told him that this was useless for the monkey was an old and cunning animal and would be hard to overcome. he must meet cunning with cunning and ask some of his friends to help him for he knew it would be quite out of his power to kill him alone. the young crab set out at once to call on the mortar his fathers old friend and told him of all that had happened. he warned him that he must be very careful in what he did for the monkey was a strong and cunning enemy. after talking for a long time as to the ways and means of carrying out their plans they separated and mr. mortar went home with the young crab to help him bury his poor father. if he were found out and he told himself that this could not be for he had escaped unseen the crabs family would be sure to bear him hatred and seek to take revenge on him. so he would not go out and kept himself at home for several days. i am sure that the old thing breathed his last before i left him. who is there to tell that i am the murderer so the monkey returned home from his walk quite content. he told himself he had nothing now to fear. one fine day when the monkey was sitting at home he was surprised by the appearance of a messenger from the young crab. he could not guess that a plot had just been set in motion against him. we were great friends as you know. i accept your kind invitation with many thanks. but aloud he thanked the monkey politely and went home. he changed his dress and set out solemnly to visit the young crab. as soon as the bows of meeting were over they led him to a hall. time passed and still he did not return. at last the monkey became impatient. i am tired of waiting so long. the monkey taken by surprise jumped backward and then started to run out of the room. now the stone mortar had hidden himself with several other stones on the top of the crabs gate and as the monkey ran underneath the mortar and all fell down on the top of the monkeys head. was it possible for the monkey to bear the weight of the mortar falling on him from the top of the gate he lay crushed and in great pain quite unable to get up. and with that he cut off the monkeys head with his pitcher claws. thought the hare. so he thought instead of asking a favor he would try to get what he wanted by a trick. the crocodile swam nearer the shore very pleased to hear some one speak. was it you mr. hare the crocodile came out of the sea and sat on the shore and the two played together for some time. the crocodile plunged into the sea and was gone for some time. the hare meanwhile waited patiently on the shore. i did not believe this was possible. now let me count you all and he was just about to run away as fast as he could. so some of them ran after the hare and caught him. then they all surrounded the poor little animal and pulled out all his fur. he could hardly move and all he could do was to lie on the beach quite helpless and weep over the misfortune that had befallen him. just at this time a number of men who looked like kings sons happened to pass by and seeing the hare lying on the beach crying stopped and asked what was the matter. then all the young men passed on. the hare was very pleased thinking that he had found a cure. just then another kings son passed by carrying a great bag on his back. he saw the hare and stopped and asked why he was crying so loudly. but the poor hare remembering that he had been deceived by one very like the man who now spoke to him did not answer but continued to cry. i see that your fur is all pulled out and that your skin is quite bare. then he went on to say how he had been deceived by a party of men who looked very like his kind friend and the hare ended his long tale of woe by begging the man to give him some medicine that would cure him and make his fur grow again. the hare was very glad to be told what to do so kindly. to his amazement even while he was doing this he saw his nice white fur growing again the pain ceased and he felt just as he had done before all his misfortunes. it is my earnest wish to do something for you in return. how kind you have been to me i am quite sure that the princess whom your brothers have gone to seek will refuse to be the bride of any of them and will prefer you for your goodness of heart. he found them just entering the princesss gate. this is the end of the story. from his childhood he proved himself to be of remarkable strength wisdom and courage and his father noticed with pride that he gave promise of great things and he loved him even more than he did his elder son. even then there was no man who could rival him for courage and bold deeds and he received his fathers command with great joy. he now met with great difficulties for he found the country exceedingly wild and rough. it was all but impossible to go on. we cannot clear the roads and fight as well. with her help he put on the robe and let his hair down till it flowed over his shoulders. he smiled as he gazed at himself the disguise was so perfect. he hardly knew himself so changed was he. all traces of the warrior had disappeared and in the shining surface only a beautiful lady looked back at him. little did they dream that it was their enemy whose coming they so dreaded who now stood before them in this disguise. this was the moment for which the brave prince had been waiting. hitherto i believed that my dead brother and i were the strongest men in the land and that there was no one who could overcome us. you are indeed a strong man to have so easily overcome us. allow me to give you a new name. he seized quickly what he thought was his sword and stood on guard to defend himself. alas even if his efforts had been successful the sword would have been of no use to him for it was of wood. when he returned to the capital the king praised him for his brave deeds and held a feast in the palace in honor of his safe coming home and presented him with many rare gifts. but the prince was not allowed to live an idle life long. the king decided that it was necessary to send an army to do battle with them and bring them to reason. but who was to lead the men these she presented to him as a parting gift. when these were over the governor told his guest that his country was famous for its fine deer and proposed a deer hunt for the princes amusement. at the same time the grass on his left and right burst into flames and these began to spread swiftly towards him on all sides. he looked round for a chance of escape. there was none. he was surrounded by fire. he determined to die if that were necessary fighting for his life and not standing still waiting for death to come to him. her garments were dainty and bright and her skin was white as snow for she had never known what it was to be weary along the path of duty or to walk in the heat of a summers sun. this is only a brook why do you men want so many boats his heart was softened at the remembrance of her and he never allowed her to pass from his thoughts even for a moment. oh my wife my wife many homes had been made desolate and the men were afraid to go out to their daily work in the fields or the women to go to the rivers to wash their rice. it is indeed a matter for wonder that here in this place so near the capital a wicked monster has dared to take up his abode and be the terror of the kings subjects. he climbed up a good distance when all of a sudden at a winding in the path a monster serpent appeared before him and stopped the way. now a sudden darkness came over the mountain and rain began to fall so that for the gloom and the rain the prince could hardly see which way to take. long long ago there lived an old man and an old woman they were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily rice. the old woman at last found a nice spot by the river bank and put her basket down. then she set to work to wash the clothes she took them one by one out of the basket and washed them in the river and rubbed them on the stones. she said to herself. she stretched out her arm to try and get it but it was quite out of her reach. the old woman was delighted. it seemed a very long time to her to wait till her husband returned. the old man at last came back as the sun was setting with a big bundle of grass on his back so big that he was almost hidden and she could hardly see him. asked the old man wondering at her unusual eagerness. it felt even heavier than before. and she told him the whole story. and out stepped a beautiful little child. the old man and his wife were both so astonished at what they saw that they fell to the ground. i am no demon or fairy. i will tell you the truth. heaven has had compassion on you. on hearing this the old man and his wife were very happy. they had cried night and day for sorrow at having no child to help them in their lonely old age and now that their prayer was answered they were so lost with joy that they did not know where to put their hands or their feet. the years passed quickly by and the child grew to be fifteen years of age. the old couples pleasure was very great when they looked at him for he was just what they thought a hero ought to be like. the old man was much surprised at hearing all this from a mere boy of fifteen. he thought it best to let the boy go. you may go if you wish. he was full of courage and did not know what fear was. the old man and woman at once set to work to pound rice in the kitchen mortar to make cakes for momotaro to take with him on his journey. at last the cakes were made and momotaro was ready to start on his long journey. parting is always sad. so it was now. momotaro was very sorry to leave his old parents though he knew he was coming back as soon as he could for he thought of how lonely they would be while he was away. quite bravely. take good care of yourselves while i am away. and he stepped quickly out of the house. in silence the eyes of momotaro and his parents met in farewell. do you know who i am the dogs manner at once changed. his tail dropped between his legs and coming near he bowed so low that his forehead touched the ground. the name of momotaro are you indeed momotaro i have often heard of your great strength. not knowing who you were i have behaved in a very stupid way. said the dog. then momotaro got up and the dog followed. as they were going along an animal came down from a tree a little ahead of them. you are welcome in this part of the country. of what use is a monkey like you in battle we are on our way to fight the devils the dog and the monkey began to quarrel and bite for these two animals always hate each other. said momotaro putting himself between them. said the dog. so the monkey joined momotaro. the dog and the monkey did not get on well together. by and by they came to a large field. here a bird flew down and alighted on the ground just in front of the little party. it was the most beautiful bird momotaro had ever seen. on its body were five different robes of feathers and its head was covered with a scarlet cap. the dog at once ran at the bird and tried to seize and kill it. momotaro as he looked on could not help admiring the bird it showed so much spirit in the fight. didnt you hear what i said said the dog. union amongst ourselves is better than any earthly gain. all the three promised not to quarrel. momotaros influence was so great that the three became good friends and hurried onwards with him as their leader. there was nothing to be seen as far as the horizon not a sign of any island. all that broke the stillness was the rolling of the waves upon the shore. how were they to cross the water and get to the island of devils are you afraid of the sea oh it is impossible to take such weak creatures as you with me to fight the demons. it will be far better for me to go alone. said the dog. said the monkey. momotaro now got a small ship and they all got on board. the wind and weather were fair and the ship went like an arrow over the sea. his three followers watched him waiting for orders. he flew off from the ship beating the air gladly with his wings. it is ridiculous to hear such words from a mean thing like you. very angry indeed were the devils. in the meantime momotaro had brought his ship to land. momotaro landed and with the hope of finding some way of entrance walked up the path towards the top followed by the monkey and the dog. the chief of the devils at last was the only one left. momotaro laughed. then momotaro tied the devil chief up and gave him into the monkeys charge. having done this he went into all the rooms of the castle and set the prisoners free and gathered together all the treasure he found. this brave warrior was always followed by a band of faithful knights. as he did so he became aware that some one was behind him and at the same time a voice called out to him to wait. as he did so he touched something that felt like an arm it was covered with hair and as big round as the trunk of a tree he attacked the ogre with all his strength and thus they fought face to face for a long time. when he got back he showed the arm to his comrades who one and all called him the hero of their band and gave him a great feast. when the servant went to the door to see who it was there was only an old woman very respectable in appearance. on being asked who she was and what was her business the old woman replied with a smile that she had been nurse to the master of the house when he was a little baby. if the lord of the house were at home she begged to be allowed to see him. the servant left the old woman at the door and went to tell his master that his old nurse had come to see him. he ordered the servant to show her in. is it really true what every one says that you cut off one of the ogres arms there is nothing that can be compared to your courage. asked the old woman. and he led the way to his own room the old woman following. he then called to the old woman to come near and look in for he never took the arm out of the box. she came nearer and nearer as if she were afraid till she stood right against the box. but the ogre sprang up to the ceiling and bursting through the roof disappeared in the mist and clouds. in this way the ogre escaped with his arm. he tried everything he could think of. but it was all of no use. it was a fine day in the early autumn and the old man enjoyed the fresh air and was in no hurry to get home. he thought that he must die of fright. he at once thought that his friends had come to look for him and he was delighted at the idea of having some jolly companions with whom to walk home. but on looking out from the tree what was his amazement to see not his friends but hundreds of demons coming towards the spot. the more he looked the greater was his astonishment. so he picked himself up and crept back into the tree. while he was sitting there and wondering impatiently when he would be able to get home he heard the sounds of gay music and then some of the demons began to sing. said the old man to himself. on peeping out the old man saw that the demon chief himself was actually sitting with his back against the tree in which he had taken refuge and all the other demons were sitting round some drinking and some dancing. he was so interested and excited in watching all that the demons were doing that he forgot himself and stepped out of the tree and stood looking on. the demon chief was just taking a big cup of sake and watching one of the demons dancing. i am tired of watching it. said the old fellow to himself. his fears however were soon overcome by his love of dancing. the old man thanked him again and promised to do so. asked the demon. asked the demon looking round. he hardly knew for some time where he was. the old man suddenly realized how late it was and began to hurry home. he was so happy that he found it impossible to walk quietly he ran and danced the whole way home. he found his wife very anxious wondering what had happened to make him so late. he soon told her all that had passed since he left home that afternoon. now next door to this good old couple there lived a wicked and disagreeable old man. he heard at once through the servant of his neighbors good luck in losing the lump on his face so he called that very evening and asked his friend to tell him everything that concerned the loss of it. the good old man told his disagreeable neighbor all that had happened to him. he described the place where he would find the hollow tree in which to hide and advised him to be on the spot in the late afternoon towards the time of sunset. the old neighbor started out the very next afternoon and after hunting about for some time came to the hollow tree just as his friend had described. here he hid himself and waited for the twilight. just as he had been told the band of demons came at that hour and held a feast with dance and song. we dont wish to see any more of such dancing. with these words he took out from a fold of his dress the lump which he had taken from the face of the old man who had danced so well the day before and threw it at the right cheek of the old man who stood before him. the wicked old man instead of losing the lump on his left cheek as he had hoped found to his dismay that he had but added another to his right cheek in his attempt to get rid of the first. the demons had all disappeared and there was nothing for him to do but to return home. she was a wonderful woman and an able ruler. his body was entirely covered with hair and his face was as black as iron. he was a wizard and a very terrible character indeed. stop he little thought how hard he would find the fight. all of a sudden they found themselves in front of what seemed to be an island rising straight out of the water. they looked up and there stood an old man with hair as white as snow smiling at them. they cried to him to help them. the old man nodded his head and came down to the edge of the water. he rushed through the water upon the old man and it seemed as if he would surely be killed. it was the only safe place for him to be in for he burnt up everything around him anywhere else but it was impossible to burn up ice and snow. to look at he was a giant and stood thirty feet high. his face was just like marble and his hair and beard long and as white as snow. and he pretended to retreat turning away the head of his horse. the wizard found that the battle was against him. to this end she ordered her subjects to collect stones of five colors blue yellow red white and black. now all was ready. when this was finished she mounted the clouds and descended to the earth hoping to find that all was now right but to her dismay she found that it was still quite dark. neither the sun shone by day nor the moon by night. but this was not easy for the palace of the sun and moon was many many hundreds of thousands of miles distant into the east. if they traveled on foot they might never reach the place they would die of old age on the road. they set out in good spirits riding above the clouds and after many days they reached the country where the sun and the moon were living happily together. then the sun and moon appeared satisfied and they both set out to try the roads. the end. there is no cross on that grave neither is there a name. fifteen years have passed. her husband brought her there in a spirit of adventure. he was a strong man rough and accustomed to the north. she loved him. not once has he stopped even to glance at the spot where she bravely lived with him and died alone. inside of two hours the poor woman was bitten to such an extent that it hurt us to look at her. they were her only pair. long afterwards we found out that she did not even dare take her boots off at night. nothing seemed to surprise nor frighten her. we had one very bad rapid to run. her canoe was the last one. she was calmly sitting on the little seat we had made for her. her umbrella was opened and she was gazing at the sky. to this day we believe that she never saw the rapid which was about one mile long. her clothes were in rags. she was covered with mud from head to foot. i dont think she spoke ten words during the entire seven days of her trip. his name was spot. ever after as soon as he was bitten or cut he would come up and beg for treatment. i never succeeded. the man had never been there and was very keen to see the white mans land. he traveled for two days and two nights in a day coach and outside of the fact that he absolutely refused to leave the train at any moment for fear of seeing it go off without him he appeared to enjoy the trip. he sat there all day looking through the window. on his return to the hunting grounds he met me on my way south and told me how much he had liked his journey to the big city. no none of these things seemed to have impressed him in the slightest. finally he admitted that there was one thing that had astonished him and that was the people in the street in front of his hotel. all those people walking so fast and passing one another without a sign. people who never stopped to speak. people who did not seem to know one another. we were drawing eighteen feet at the stern. he glanced at it and nodded. in the end we gave in and told him to take charge. he did not know a word of english. for a long time he kept us going at half. he swung our course from one side of the river to the other. we reached the post safely and dropped anchor exactly where he told us to. the boy is a grown up man now. they knew for instance that they could obtain a certain speed which they could judge by a certain instrument with an arrow the figures of which they could not of course read. but a lot of them were killed. the first time he was alone in charge he ran the engine beautifully. they just repeated what had struck their imagination. in other words what they had understood. he never thought of war. it was in summer when the supply ship reached his post that he learned what had really happened. they had a head wind and the waves were pretty high. the bag landed in an empty space right at the bottom of the canoe. instantly the water started pouring in. they decided to bring it back to the post at once. they had not caught anything before that and were half starved. the men had to travel on the ice along the sea coast. the silver fox was shown to us at the station next summer. the fox eventually reached our new york house and was sold during the winter. there was no trail. an indian was struggling ahead of the dogs. everywhere silence. there was no sign of animal life. not a track anywhere. at a bend of the small valley the indian looking ahead stopped dead. the dog traces were hanging loose. alone the leader had chosen to remain beside the sleigh. he was weak from hunger but still faithful to his charge. he made a good fight for it but the snow was too deep and his strength was far gone. we gently brushed away the snow from the top of the sleigh and looked at the man. he was lying on his back a smile on his white face his light blue eyes staring far away into the sky. the dog was in the lead tied to the sleigh by at least twelve yards of rope. before we could say a word man bull and dog vanished round a bend of the river. the hay on the sleigh was to feed the poor animal on the trip. throughout the first day the bull made wild rushes at the dog who took great care to keep a distance between himself and his enemy. but after covering twenty miles or so the little bull gave it up as a bad job and settled down. they needed the meat but preferred waiting until the animal was near land before shooting it. they accordingly decided to have some fun pulling up the hammer he repeated the performance with the same result. in his excitement he forgot to pull out his knife and cut the rope. they stand closely packed right to the edge of the water. the water is as pure as crystal and deep as a well. lightning striking a tree. an ordinary piece of glass lying on dry moss and catching the rays of the sun. in the solitude of the far north where men are scattered a hundred miles from one another no help can be secured to fight the red evil. they cannot keep pace with the flames. little by little they fall back. then the parents return to them and remain at their side until it is too late. perfectly indifferent to one another their only thought is to keep away from the flames. they told me that it was their father who had died a considerable time ago and they were absolutely obliged to bury him as soon as possible. meanwhile the coffin had been dragged outside to make more room. it lay grim and dark on the right side of the door along the wall of the cabin. all the dogs of the village one by one their tails curled up and their ears pointed were passing in front of it in a solemn procession. i watched them from a distance. creeping up slowly we got up to a hundred yards from them before they took any notice of the ship. the meat was needed for the dogs. the rest of the herd dived and scattered. he was very keen and excited. everyone on board was terrified. he weighed over fifteen hundred pounds. after that for many weeks each time he felt like it he would search along the banks until he found the stake of a net. then he would take to the water and swim to the net itself. so far so good. little harm was done. one day he hit on the plan of dragging the net to the bank instead of swimming out to it. he therefore caught in his jaw the stout rope where it was tied to the stake. one day at dawn he was seen by an indian. he had to pay the price of his sin. such is the law of the wilderness. the older woman who was lame had been left behind with her daughter to look after her. in the end the two women had killed and eaten the only dog that had remained with them. to that effect the younger woman knife in hand walked along the beach for about three miles. she was already weak from hunger. the constant strain began to tell on her. seals have good ears. the slightest sound of panting would have driven the animal head first into the water. it took her all day to cover the two miles. still she could not take the risk of hurrying. he took absolutely no notice of us. squirrels i have noticed always swim with the wind in their backs and invariably carry their tails straight up in the air out of the water. they can swim for a whole day resting now and then on their backs like sleeping seals. from saturday midnight to monday one oclock all the men remain idle. i happened to look over the side and saw a young seal sound asleep on the ice a few hundred yards from the ship. although i followed my footsteps on the ice i suddenly broke through and found myself plunged into the bitterly cold water. i tried hard to climb out on the ice. the young seal floated like an empty bottle his body half out of the water. we found the bears den easily. the others standing in front of the den were to let the dogs go as soon as the brute appeared. we had to wait after that for three days until the weather was clear and fine. in the end the hour came. at first everything went off beautifully. in a flash she was through the pack of dogs and away the bear never stopped for at least a mile. we never found another bear in her den that year. he had a load of fur in his canoe and was hurrying to the line to sell it and get drunk. i had only one shirt a clean one i had only worn a few times and i was thinking of using it myself when i moved south. so i said no and advised him to take his shirt off and lay it on an ant heap. he did what i said. you know the kind boys the little red ones a few struggle through and succeed. gold was reported to have been found. one man said it was a bear because it moved. so that was the black bear seen an hour ago we could not understand how he got there. he had no canoe. the rock was about three foot square. we considered a way to rescue him. the idea of running down in a canoe was out of the question. we hit on the following plan. we managed to let the log pass more or less alongside the stranger but for a long time the man appeared frightened. each time he missed his chance of catching hold of the log. and we had to hand it up again thirty yards or so to be able to give it the proper direction so that it would pass as near as possible to the rock. finally the stranger decided to take a chance. there was quite a splash and for a second we could not see whether he had succeeded in getting hold of the stump. our rope was tight. we had reached the end of it. in a few minutes we knew we had our man at the end of our line. little by little we got him alongside. with an effort we got him on board. an hour later our new acquaintance was able to talk and tell us his story. he was a student and had gone with a party to the upper end of the river in search of gold. stealing a canoe he had started alone on his journey. he had never been in the woods before. it was more or less twice as large. some are bigger. they were full grown although they had not yet learned how to fly. each time it remained under water almost a minute. whatever may be their calling there is one thing which no indian man woman or child can resist. its to try to lay low big game. the child was in the bow of the canoe. the child was frightened but she answered the call of the blood. she was too young to know how to use her small weapon. finally she buried her axe in the bulls huge back. there was a silent but proud little indian girl in camp that night. a land of waste lying on the top of the world. his food is nearly gone. south the line of trees has disappeared. north nothing but the rolling desert of moss and rock. it is night. his eyes are staring ahead of him. then his brain gives way. no one knew how he got that strange name. he was about sixty years old and thought himself head and shoulders above any other native in the country. it must have taken several men quite a few days of labor to put it up. i know. it was here when i a little boy. indians have the reputation of being always of a serious turn of mind. my experience is to the contrary. the father an old indian with long grey hair decided to sleep in the open. then they hid in the bush and waited. after that he looked up towards the sky. he searched silently for clouds and signs of rain. so were the stars that was too much for the two indians hiding in the bush. they were still making merry over the joke. nobody had ever taught him that. there never was a mistake. from then on until spring those indians live on the herd using the meat for food and the leather for clothing. if he has missed the man calls out a second time. no one was there to meet me and i did not know a word of russian. i was told that the town was at least six miles away and that to reach it one had to travel through a wild empty country of rolling plain and small bush. in fact only that week before my arrival a traveler was supposed to have been shot and robbed on the same road that i had to take to go to town. we started slowly through very bad roads. the cold was intense. at that time we were half way up a small hill and on the top of it hardly one hundred yards from us plainly visible on the sky line was a man on horseback. i was being held up after all. there must have been one hundred of them. everywhere silence. his square jaw is closed tightly. the man has been there every day for weeks. his task finished he looks again towards the sea for a full minute. they have heard the signal and their excitement is great. the latter can be found everywhere in the bush. he had started doing it while leaping against the wall of the room but ended by doing it at any moment even from a standing position. in summer he was allowed to use a hole cut out for him on one of the windows on the ground floor. but they never did. the two little boys remained there all day. night came. when dawn appeared there were no signs of the two men. when the third day came they decided to walk back following the shore to the tribe. picking up on the beach what they could find to eat they eventually got back to the tribe after two days and nights of constant traveling. he did not seem to be able to speak a word of english. i knelt beside him and put my water bottle to his lips. when he had finished drinking i began slowly to tell him one by one all the words i remembered. he looked at me with a startled face then his expression changed little by little. he was far gone then but he could still hear and understand the words of his native tongue. it was all over in a few seconds. he was old tame as a dog and very wise. we had no fixed place to go. jack behaved perfectly for three days. then he proceeded on his way as if nothing had happened. each time we laid them on his pack ever so gently from behind he would stop dead and lie down again. we decided to put our faith in jack. he seemed to understand that we were going home. he took us back foot by foot exactly the same way we had come. he never changed his pace once. but nothing would make him step out of what he thought was the proper trail. he absolutely refused and showed the usual signs of lying down. he had been in charge all the way back and intended remaining so until we arrived. before leaving the camp i asked the indian to sell me some white fish for dog feed of which i was short. he had plenty of it. there lay the dead body of a six months old child. it was the indians youngest baby. the weather was dead calm. she had seen us and was trying to get away. so had the cook and one of the sailors. for a long time the bears were able to keep their distance. we reached at last a spot where the ice was scattered. huge lakes separated each pan. although the bears swam bravely the ship was gaining on them. the young animals were now getting exhausted. the cubs their tongues out were giving signs of distress. their only idea was to stop lie down bury their heads in their front paws and rest. this she repeated time and again. further on was the open sea. there was silence on board. the man was content with one mail a year. as soon as the vessel had left his station he was entirely cut off from the rest of the world until the next summer. in the stern sat the old man. he heard us the first time. that animal would follow the mans trail starting a few hours behind him. when we returned the bag was gone. i have already spoken about that dog. poor dear old spot he was getting old and the last trip was too much for him. after a week of bitter suffering he fell in the traces. we put him on the sleigh. he rolled off in the snow and tried to get back to his place in the lead. little by little even out of harness he could not follow the pace. he fell back on the trail. all day he struggled behind us. that night he joined the camp two hours after dark. early the next morning before anyone stirred in camp my man shot him in his sleep. poor dear old spot i happened to be there at the time. he was very silent during the evening meal and left us immediately afterwards. then it came again this time louder. suddenly something moved in front of us and we held our breath. his face was purple and his eyes were half closed. for a half hour we listened to the little man. not once did he stop. late into the night after turning in we still heard him. there was nothing very unusual in the sight. such is the custom. when the man had travelled an hour he missed his wifes tracks. night came. nobody had seen her. three times search parties went out and came back without any news. during that time she hadnt had a fire. there was no wood to burn even if she had had matches. but she wasnt even frost bitten. during all the years i have known him i have never seen him once without some peculiar animal at his door step. first it was a bear. the brute was full grown and tied to a tree by a chain. it allowed his master to stroke him but was dangerous to anyone else. it was a great sight. i had not heard of his new venture but although i fully expected to find something unusual in his household i was not exactly prepared for what i saw. half a mile before reaching his home i knew something was up. i guess a city guy could if ever he was able to get there. no other words could have described better what i felt at that moment. the cold was intense. not a tree. not a sign of animal life. not a track. unable to understand one another except by signs we made a strange pair struggling through the wilderness. for three hours i kept on my way without being caught up by my guide. tired out anxious to make camp i began to worry seriously about my companion. still no sign of my man leaving my dogs curled up beside the sleigh i started back on the trail. i walked for about ten minutes stopping now and then to listen. i was frightened i thought i heard someone singing in a few minutes the song increased in volume. i waited as soon as i recovered from my surprise i started to question him in english. i have known him for several years. they were both sitting on the top of their sleigh and their five dogs were plainly tired. the man had lost his whip but held instead a short thick piece of hard wood about three feet in length. i never saw him miss once. both men strange to say were the best of friends. the indian opened his eyes for an instant recognized the priest and nodded. he prayed and prayed with all his might while he watched the dying mans face. finally he stopped exhausted. surely victory was his. he got up on his feet and gently touched the mans hand. the old indian opened his eyes and looked up at the priest steadily. his lips moved and the father bent forward to listen. his hour had come at last he thought his religion had won he watched them at a distance without being seen. that went on for a long time. dont you feel a great longing for something new something clean something different from what you have been accustomed to dont you hear now and then a whispering coming from nowhere in particular and calling you do you know what i mean have you felt it some people may laugh others may wonder. but the man who has answered that call will never forget it. but sooner or later the longing to go back there will come to him again and if he cannot do so he will always regret it. utter freedom the sun rising while the crimson of sunset is still glowing in the west. the dull roar of the rapid in the distance. the sharp howl of the hunting wolf. the splash of the fish rising to the surface of the lake. the northern lights dancing silently in the sky. peace and utter freedom this is fine he said to himself. how stupid you are why didnt you tell him   well why didnt you say   you might have reminded him   and so on in the usual way but of course it was then much too late as is always the case. it all seemed too good to be true. after all the best part of a holiday is perhaps not so much to be resting yourself as to see all the other fellows busy working. a brown little face with whiskers. it was the water rat then the two animals stood and regarded each other cautiously. lean on that he said. nice it was too late. in or out of em it doesnt matter. nothing seems really to matter thats the charm of it. look here what a day im having he said. let us start at once
hold hard a minute then said the rat. i like your clothes awfully old chap he remarked after some half an hour or so had passed. you must think me very rude but all this is so new to me. and you really live by the river what a jolly life
by it and with it and on it and in it said the rat. its my world and i dont want any other. lord the times weve had together youre new to it and of course you dont know. the bank is so crowded nowadays that many people are moving away altogether o no it isnt what it used to be at all. that o thats just the wild wood said the rat shortly. the squirrels are all right. and the rabbits some of em but rabbits are a mixed lot. and then theres badger of course. he lives right in the heart of it wouldnt live anywhere else either if you paid him to do it. dear old badger and thats something that doesnt matter either to you or me. ive never been there and im never going nor you either if youve got any sense at all. now then o my all the world seems out on the river today. come on old badger shouted the rat. company
and turned his back and disappeared from view. thats just the sort of fellow he is observed the disappointed rat. well tell us whos out on the river
toads out for one replied the otter. the rat stood up and hailed him but toad for it was he shook his head and settled sternly to his work. it happened this way. neither was the otter. the mole looked down. not an otter to be seen as far as the distant horizon. well well said the rat i suppose we ought to be moving. o please let me said the mole. so of course the rat let him. it never is. please i want to row now
the rat shook his head with a smile. not yet my young friend he said wait till youve had a few lessons. stop it you silly ass cried the rat from the bottom of the boat. you cant do it over went the boat and he found himself struggling in the river. o my how cold the water was and o how very wet it felt. how it sang in his ears as he went down down down how black was his despair when he felt himself sinking again it was the rat and he was evidently laughing the mole could feel him laughing right down his arm and through his paw and so into his the moles neck. indeed i have been a complete ass and i know it. whats a little wet to a water rat im more in the water than out of it most days. dont you think any more about it and look here i really think you had better come and stop with me for a little time. its very plain and rough you know not like toads house at all but you havent seen that yet still i can make you comfortable. ii. he had just composed it himself so he was very taken up with it and would not pay proper attention to mole or anything else. since early morning he had been swimming in the river in company with his friends the ducks. everyone for what he likes i dont know that i think so very much of that little song rat
observed the mole cautiously. nor dont the ducks neither replied the rat cheerfully. but what i wanted to ask you was wont you take me to call on mr. toad its never the wrong time to call on toad. early or late hes always the same fellow. he is indeed the best of animals replied rat. so simple so goodnatured and so affectionate. the rat looked around him. i understand said he. hes tired of it and done with it. come along and lets look him up. how kind of you he went on dancing round them. i want you badly both of you. now what will you take come inside and have something or anywhere else for that matter he could not help adding. unfortunately the toad saw him do it and turned very red. there was a moments painful silence. then toad burst out laughing. its only my way you know. and its not such a very bad house is it you know you rather like it yourself. now look here. lets be sensible. you are the very animals i wanted. youve got to help me. youre getting on fairly well though you splash a good bit still. ive given that up long ago. here today up and off to somewhere else tomorrow travel change interest excitement the whole world before you and a horizon thats always changing and mind come inside and look at the arrangements. i want to show you the world im not coming and thats flat. and i am going to stick to my old river and live in a hole and boat as ive always done. ill always stick to you rat and what you say is to be has got to be. poor mole toad was watching both of them closely. of course i dont really care. i only want to give pleasure to you fellows. it was a golden afternoon. o my this is the real life for a gentleman talk about your old river
i dont talk about my river replied the patient rat. you know i dont toad. shall we run away tomorrow morning quite early very early and go back to our dear old hole on the river
no no well see it out whispered back the rat. thanks awfully but i ought to stick by toad till this trip is ended. it wouldnt be safe for him to be left to himself. it wont take very long. good night
the end was indeed nearer than even the rat suspected. ill have the law of you ill report you then he went to look at the cart on its side in the ditch. it was indeed a sorry sight. the rat came to help him but their united efforts were not sufficient to right the cart. toad they cried. are you coming to help us toad he demanded sternly. glorious stirring sight murmured toad never offering to move. the poetry of motion the real way to travel the only way to travel here today in next week tomorrow o my nothing at all replied the rat firmly. because there is really nothing to be done. you see i know him from of old. he is now possessed. never mind him. its five or six miles to the nearest town and we shall just have to walk it. its not safe. mend the cart i never want to see the cart or to hear of it again. i owe it all to you my best of friends
the rat turned from him in despair. you see what it is he said to the mole addressing him across toads head hes quite hopeless. they then left the horse at an inn stable and gave what directions they could about the cart and its contents. heard the news he said. theres nothing else being talked about all along the river bank. toad went up to town by an early train this morning. the wild wood 
the mole had long wanted to make the acquaintance of the badger. but whenever the mole mentioned his wish to the water rat he always found himself put off. its all right the rat would say. badgerll turn up some day or other hes always turning up and then ill introduce you. the best of fellows but you must not only take him as you find him but when you find him.
couldnt you ask him here dinner or something said the mole. he wouldnt come replied the rat simply. o im sure he wouldnt like that at all said the rat quite alarmed. hes so very shy hed be sure to be offended. ive never even ventured to call on him at his own home myself though i know him so well. besides we cant. but i think we wont go there just now. not just yet. and what a play it had been he had got down to the bare bones of it and they were fine and strong and simple. everything was very still now. then the faces began. he passed another hole and another and another and then yes no yes certainly a little narrow face with hard eyes had flashed up for an instant from a hole and was gone. if he could only get away from the holes in the banks he thought there would be no more faces. then the whistling began. very faint and shrill it was and far behind him when first he heard it but somehow it made him hurry forward. he thought it was only falling leaves at first so slight and delicate was the sound of it. was it in front or behind it seemed to be first one and then the other then both. instead the animal almost brushed him as it dashed past his face set and hard his eyes staring. the whole wood seemed running now running hard hunting chasing closing in round something or somebody but the mole was not there. he listened for a time. the house seemed very quiet. there they were sure enough. the rat looked very grave and stood in deep thought for a minute or two. where are you its me its old rat
he had patiently hunted through the wood for an hour or more when at last to his joy he heard a little answering cry. is that really you
the rat crept into the hollow and there he found the mole exhausted and still trembling. i did my best to keep you from it. besides there are a hundred things one has to know which we understand all about and you dont as yet. old toad said the rat laughing heartily. now then said the rat presently we really must pull ourselves together and make a start for home while theres still a little light left. it will never do to spend the night here you understand. you must let me rest here a while longer and get my strength back if im to get home at all.
o all right said the goodnatured rat rest away. we must make a start and take our chance i suppose. the worst of it is i dont exactly know where we are. the mole would not have known that it was the same wood. there seemed to be no end to this wood and no beginning and no difference in it and worst of all no way out. we cant sit here very long said the rat. we shall have to make another push for it and do something or other. well make our way down into that and try and find some sort of shelter a cave or hole with a dry floor to it out of the snow and the wind and there well have a good rest before we try again for were both of us pretty dead beat. o my leg he cried. poor old mole said the rat kindly. you dont seem to be having much luck today do you lets have a look at the leg. o my that was never done by a branch or a stump. looks as if it was made by a sharp edge of something in metal. well he said at last slowly i see it right enough. seen the same sort of thing before lots of times. familiar object i call it. well what of it of course i see what it means replied the mole. when i get home i shall go and complain about it to to somebody or other see if i dont
o dear there what did i tell you exclaimed the rat in great triumph. they simply dont do it. they are not that sort at all. he worked till he could get a paw through and feel then called the mole to come and help him. a real wonder thats what you are. i see it all now did you stop there no. some people would have been quite satisfied but not you. youre so clever i believe you could find anything you liked. youre simply wasted here among us fellows. iv. it seemed as the mole remarked to the rat like some one walking in carpet slippers that were too large for him and down at heel which was intelligent of mole because that was exactly what it was. speak up
oh badger cried the rat let us in please. come along in both of you at once. why you must be perished. well i never lost in the snow and in the wild wood too and at this time of night but come in with you.
the two animals tumbled over each other in their eagerness to get inside and heard the door shut behind them with great joy and relief. he looked kindly down on them and patted both their heads. but come along come into the kitchen. as he did not go into society himself he had got an idea that these things belonged to the things that didnt really matter. we know of course that he was wrong and took too narrow a view because they do matter very much though it would take too long to explain why. the mole began to feel very friendly towards him. tell us the news from your part of the world. oh well after all its the same thing with toad. this is the seventh. killed or ruined its got to be one of the two things sooner or later. badger all are sleepy some actually asleep. very well then continued the badger. 
both animals nodded gravely. they knew well then went on the badger we that is you and me and our friend the mole here well take toad seriously in hand. well stand no nonsense whatever. well bring him back to reason by force if need be. well make him be a sensible toad. hes been asleep two or three times since supper said the mole laughing. come along you two and ill show you your quarters. there sit down sit down said the rat pleasantly and go on with your porridge. and whats the weather like outside o terrible bad sir terrible deep the snow is said the hedgehog. thought i should find you here all right said the otter cheerfully. they were all in a great state of alarm along river bank when i arrived this morning. rat never been home all night nor mole either something dreadful must have happened they said and the snow had covered up all your tracks of course. but i knew that when people were in any fix they mostly went to badger or else badger got to know of it somehow so i came straight off here through the wild wood and the snow my making you jump and run for cover. there was nothing else to be done. nervous the otter showed a gleaming set of strong white teeth as he laughed. better stop and have it with us. ill send some one with you to show you the way. once well underground he said you know exactly where you are. nothing can happen to you and nothing can get at you. things go on all the same overhead and you let em and dont bother about em. thats exactly what i say he replied. if you feel your house is a bit too big you stop up a hole or two and there you are again look at rat now. take toad. i say nothing against toad hall quite the best house in these parts as a house. when lunch is over he said ill take you all round this little place of mine. how on earth badger he said at last did you ever find time and strength to do all this theres lots more of it all round about. i see you dont understand and i must explain it to you. well very long ago on the spot where the wild wood waves now before ever it had planted itself and grown up to what it now is there was a city a city of people you know. here where we are standing they lived and walked and talked and slept and carried on their business. who can tell said the badger. it is their way. but we remain. up above us on the surface the same thing happened. they didnt bother themselves about the past they never do theyre too busy. and they dont bother about the future either the future when perhaps the people will move in again for a time as may very well be. it takes all sorts to make a world. but i fancy you know something about them yourself by this time.
i do indeed said the mole with a slight shiver. theyre not so bad really and we must all live and let live. but ill pass the word around tomorrow and i think youll have no further trouble. any friend of mine walks where he likes in this country or ill know the reason why
when they got back to the kitchen again they found the rat walking up and down very restless. come along mole he said anxiously as soon as he caught sight of them. we must get off while its daylight. dont want to spend another night in the wild wood again.
itll be all right my fine fellow said the otter. they found themselves standing on the very edge of the wild wood. oh never mind said the rat. home he must obey it instantly and go. come back you dont understand its my home my old home ive just come across the smell of it and its close by here really quite close. and i must go to it i must i must please please come back
the rat was by this time very far ahead too far to hear clearly what the mole was calling too far to catch the sharp note of painful appeal in his voice. well come for it tomorrow whatever it is youve found. and i want your nose mole so come on quick theres a good fellow and the rat pressed forward on his way without waiting for an answer. no talk left in you and your feet dragging like lead. well sit down here for a minute and rest. whatever can be the matter o dear o dear what a pig i have been a pig thats me its no good i tell you its too late and too dark and the place is too far off and the snows coming and and i never meant to let you know i was feeling that way about it it was all an accident and a mistake and think of river bank and your supper
hang river bank and supper too said the rat heartily. i tell you im going to find this place now if i stay out all night. business so well planned everything here and everything in its place well make a jolly night of it. the first thing we want is a good fire ill see to that i always know where to find things. so this is the parlour splendid capital theres a banquet for you observed the rat as he arranged the table. your cellar of course deny yourself nothing. no wonder youre so fond of it mole. wheres young bill it will be like old times to hear them again.
lets have a look at them cried the rat jumping up and running to the door. joy was hers in the morning very well sung boys cried the rat heartily. this is quite like old times shut the door after you. pull up that settle to the fire. whatever are we doing here you with the lantern come over this way. i want to talk to you. sensible mole the very thing they act plays too these fellows the mole explained to the rat. make them up all by themselves and act them afterwards. and very well they do it too here you you were in it i remember. the rat said little or nothing only taking care that each guest had what he wanted and plenty of it and that mole had no trouble or anxiety about anything. sleepy is simply not the word. very well then ill take this. but it was good to think he had this to come back to this place which was all his own these things which were so glad to see him again and could always be counted upon for the same simple welcome. bother said the rat all over egg. then he flung the parlour door open and announced with much importance mr. whose hour you should rather say replied the badger. why toads hour the hour of toad i remember now we must be up and doing ere it is too late. well rescue the poor unhappy animal come on you fellows he cried cheerfully on catching sight of them. the badger strode up the steps. take him inside he said sternly to his companions. im afraid you wont be wanted today he said. mr. toad has changed his mind. please understand that this is final. they had to lay toad out on the floor kicking and calling all sorts of names before they could get to work properly. you knew it must come to this sooner or later toad the badger explained severely. now youre a good fellow in many respects and i dont want to be too hard on you. ill make one more effort to bring you to reason. talking to toadll never cure him. sit down there toad said the badger kindly pointing to a chair. first you are sorry for what youve done and you see the folly of it all
there was a long long pause. at last he spoke. and it wasnt folly at all id have said anything in there. off i go in it
told you so didnt i observed the rat to the mole. very well then said the badger firmly rising to his feet. i feared it would come to this all along. youve often asked us three to come and stay with you toad in this handsome house of yours well now were going to. ive never seen toad so determined. however we will see it out. each animal took it in turns to sleep in toads room at night and they divided the day up between them. toads still in bed he told the rat outside the door. now you look out rat theres sure to be something up. i know him. he had to wait some minutes for an answer. so good of you to inquire but first tell me how you are yourself and the excellent mole
o were all right replied the rat. but do not trouble about me. i hate being a burden to my friends and i do not expect to be one much longer. youve been a fine bother to us all this time and im glad to hear its going to stop. its too bad of you toad i can quite understand it. its natural enough. but dont you bother. surely you have noticed of late   murmured toad. but no why should you noticing things is only a trouble. but you can hardly be bad enough for that yet. outside he stopped to consider. its best to be on the safe side he said on reflection. if theres nothing really the matter the doctor will tell him hes an old ass and cheer him up and that will be something gained. however talking wont mend matters. but wed better continue to sleep at toad hall for a while longer. brain against brute force and brain came out on the top as its bound to do. my wont he catch it when the badger gets back toad listened eagerly all ears for a time at last he could stand it no longer.  so you had better make it a round twenty years and be on the safe side concluded the clerk. prisoner pull yourself together and try and stand up straight. its going to be twenty years for you this time. he had been on the river with some companions leaving the water rat free to keep a engagement of long standing with otter and he had come back to find the house dark and deserted and no sign of rat who was doubtless keeping it up late with his old comrade. you stayed to supper of course said the mole presently. simply had to said the rat. they wouldnt hear of my going before. you know how kind they always are. and they made things as jolly for me as ever they could right up to the moment i left. but i felt a brute all the time as it was clear to me they were very unhappy though they tried to hide it. mole im afraid theyre in trouble. well suppose he is why worry about it but no harm ever happens to him. and theyve asked every animal too for miles around and no one knows anything about him. otters evidently more anxious than hell admit. otters not the fellow to be nervous about any son of his before its time. and now he is nervous. when i left he came out with me said he wanted some air and talked about stretching his legs. well well said the rat presently i suppose we ought to be thinking about turning in. but he never offered to move. rat said the mole i simply cant go and turn in and go to sleep and do nothing even though there doesnt seem to be anything to be done. then a change began slowly to declare itself. its gone sighed the rat sinking back in his seat again. so beautiful and strange and new. since it was to end so soon i almost wish i had never heard it. for it has roused a longing in me that is pain and nothing seems worth while but just to hear that sound once more and go on listening to it for ever. no o mole the beauty of it such music i never dreamed of and the call in it is stronger even than the music is sweet row on mole row for the music and the call must be for us.
the mole greatly wondering obeyed. now you must surely hear it he saw the tears on his comrades cheeks and bowed his head and understood. he might not refuse were death himself waiting to strike him instantly once he had looked with mortal eye on things rightly kept hidden. rat he found breath to whisper shaking. afraid of him o never never mole rubbed his eyes and stared at rat who was looking about him in a puzzled sort of way. i beg your pardon what did you say rat he asked. and look but mole stood still a moment held in thought. come along rat called the mole. its being up all night youll say perhaps but thats nothing. we do as much half the nights of the week at this time of the year. i feel just as you do mole simply dead tired though not body tired. its lucky weve got the stream with us to take us home. row nearer mole nearer to the reeds nearer mole nearer that i do not know said the rat simply. i passed them on to you as they reached me. ah now they return again and this time full and clear but no answer came. he looked and understood the silence. o wise old badger he said o clever intelligent rat and sensible mole i cant bear to see that poor beast so unhappy and getting so thin you know how fond of animals i am. so that day she went on her errand of mercy and knocked at the door of toads cell. and do try and eat a bit of dinner. tell me about toad hall said she. tell me something real about it. toad she said presently just listen please. you talk too much thats your chief fault and im trying to think and you hurt my head. she takes out the washing on monday morning and brings it in on friday evening. a few pounds wouldnt make any difference to you and it would mean a lot to her. but have it your own way. but look here you are a good kind clever girl he said and i am indeed a proud and a stupid toad. toad was delighted with the suggestion. now its your turn toad said the girl. now goodbye toad and good luck. i find ive left my purse behind. i should think you were pretty well known in these parts
he said if youve tried this game on often. what was to be done could he not squeeze under the seat of a carriage very well thats that. presently he called out i can see it clearly now i have no children waiting for me innocent or otherwise but you are evidently in sore trouble and distress so i will not desert you. so cheer up toad you see they are running light and they have the better engine. theres just one thing left for us to do and its your only chance so attend very carefully to what i tell you. then i will go full speed ahead again and they can chase me if they like for as long as they like and as far as they like. stop stop when they were past the toad had a hearty laugh for the first time since he was thrown into prison. but he soon stopped laughing when he came to consider that it was now very late and dark and cold and he was in an unknown wood with no money and no chance of supper and still far from friends and home and the dead silence of everything after the roar and rattle of the train was something of a shock. ho ho which toad thought in very poor taste. toad looked about for a stone to throw at him but could not succeed in finding one which vexed him more than anything. natures grand hotel has its season like the others. why not stay on quietly here like us and be jolly you dont know this hotel out of the season and what fun we have among ourselves we fellows who remain and see the whole interesting year out. here too he had many small friends a society complete in itself leading full and busy lives but always with a spare moment to gossip and exchange news with a visitor. come and bear a hand rat and dont stand about idle
what sort of games are you up to said the water rat severely. its a splendid day. youd better sit down somewhere. whats the hurry thats half the fun
fun said the rat now thats just what i dont understand. but to want to talk about it or even think about it till you really need  
no you dont understand naturally said the second swallow. well all do our best to make you feel at home. i had grown so fond of the place that when the time came i hung back and let the others go on without me. for a few weeks it was all well enough but afterwards o the weary length of the nights but today all that seems pale and thin and very far away. everything seems asleep and yet going on all the time. i did not say exactly that replied the stranger cautiously but no doubt its the best. ive tried it and i know. and where have you just come from he asked. he hardly dared to ask where he was bound for he seemed to know the answer only too well. never mind about it. i had everything i could want everything i had any right to expect of life and more and here i am glad to be here all the same though glad to be here a fair city and an ancient and glorious one. i know them all and they know me. such a life as you describe would not suit me at all. family troubles as usual began it. i know everybody there and their ways just suit me. i spent many jolly weeks in the island staying with friends up country. im an old hand he remarked with much simplicity. the captains cabins good enough for me.
its a hard life by all accounts murmured the rat sunk in deep thought. but couldnt you fetch it along out here by degrees the rat began to sit up and to join in. its quite a long time since you did any poetry he remarked. free he had the world all to himself that early summer morning. toad however was looking for something that could talk and tell him clearly which way he ought to go. the practical toad cared very much indeed and he could have kicked the road for its helpless silence when every minute was of importance to him. bother them said toad to himself. but anyhow one things clear. they must both be coming from somewhere and going to somewhere. you cant get over that. toad my boy so he marched on patiently by the waters edge. a nice morning maam she remarked to toad as she drew up level with him. i dare it is a nice morning to them thats not in sore trouble like what i am. she lives near to the river maam replied toad. perhaps you may have heard of it.
toad hall toads luck again thought he. you see i understand my work thoroughly and attend to it all myself. but you know what girls are maam and are you very fond of washing
i love it said toad. but then it comes so easy to me no trouble at all i like washing too just the same as you do and for that matter whether i like it or not i have got to do all my own naturally moving about as i do. instead of which hes gone off with the dog to see if they cant pick up a rabbit for dinner somewhere. says hell catch me up at the next lock. well thats as may be i dont trust him once he gets off with that dog whos worse than he is. try and fix your mind on that rabbit. a nice fat young rabbit ill be bound. theres a heap of things of mine that youll find in a corner of the cabin. i might spoil your things or not do em as you like. im more used to gentlemens things myself. besides its dull work and i want you to be happy. nothing that he could do to the things seemed to please them or do them good. now toad was very proud of his paws. ive been watching you all the time she gasped. why so you are she cried. well i never he saw what he wanted ahead of him. toad now knew well that he had not been really hungry before. what he said me sell this beautiful young horse of mine o no its out of the question. some people do.
you dont seem to see continued toad that this fine horse of mine is a cut above you altogether. hes a blood horse he is partly not the part you see of course another part. no its not to be thought of for a moment. on the other hand it did not seem very much to get for a horse. i tell you what we will do and this is my last word. if thats not good enough for you say so and ill be getting on. he thought that he had never eaten so good a breakfast in all his life. he was indeed a very different toad from the animal of an hour ago. ho ho
he said to himself as he marched along with his chin in the air what a clever toad i am what of it ho ho but they none of them know one half as much             as intelligent mr. toad was it the king no. it was mr. toad. but his pride was shortly to have a severe fall. this is something like said the excited toad. this is real life again this is once more the great world from which i have been missed so long its all over now prison again dry bread and water again o what a fool i have been this is very sad perhaps she is overcome by the heat poor creature or possibly she has not had any food today. look said one of the gentlemen she is better already. the fresh air is doing her good. how do you feel now maam
thank you kindly sir said toad in a feeble voice im feeling a great deal better thats right said the gentleman. i was only thinking if i might sit on the front seat there beside the driver where i could get the fresh air full in my face i should soon be all right again.
what a very sensible woman said the gentleman. toad was almost himself again by now. it is fate he said to himself. why struggle and he turned to the driver at his side. i like your spirit. let her have a try and look after her. ho ho down with the desperate and dangerous toad
alas toad as usual comes out on the top who was it got them to give him a lift who managed to get on the front seat for the sake of fresh air who persuaded them into letting him see if he could drive o how clever i am o horror o misery o despair shouting and singing songs again o my o my o my
he glanced back and saw to his dismay that they were gaining on him. he did his best but he was a fat animal and his legs were short and still they gained. he could hear them close behind him now. he rose to the surface and tried to grasp the reeds and the rushes that grew along the waters edge close under the bank but the stream was so strong that it tore them out of his hands. presently he saw that he was approaching a big dark hole in the bank just above his head and as the stream bore him past he reached up with a paw and caught hold of the edge and held on. as it approached a face grew up gradually around it and it was a familiar face brown and small with whiskers. it was the water rat ive been through such times since i saw you last you cant think been in prison got out of it of course been thrown into a canal swam ashore stole a horse sold him for a large sum of money oh i am a smart toad and no mistake ill have something to say to you later
toad was at first inclined to stop and do some talking back at him. he had had enough of being ordered about when he was in prison and here was the thing being begun all over again apparently and by a rat too wheres the amusement in that where does the fun come in but if you will be mixed up with them as you generally are five minutes after youve started why steal them when are you going to be sensible and think of your friends and try and be a credit to them and even when most set upon a thing he was always able to see the other side of the question. how sound you always are dont take on so old chap and stamp and upset things it was only an idea and we wont talk any more about it now. ive had enough of adventures. what are you talking about do you mean to say you havent heard
heard what said toad turning rather pale. quick dont spare me no not a word what have they been doing
 and how theyve been and taken toad hall continued the rat. the worst is over. i am an animal again. animals took sides as always happens. but the wild wood animals said hard things and served you right and it was time this sort of thing was stopped. you would never come back again never never
toad nodded once more keeping silence. thats the sort of little beasts they are the rat went on. but mole and badger they stuck out through thick and thin that you would come back again soon somehow. they made the best fight they could but what was the good ill jolly soon see about that
its no good toad called the rat after him. stuff and nonsense said toad very angrily. what do you mean by talking like that to me what did i tell you said the rat. its no good. all seemed very peaceful and deserted and quiet. it filled and sank and toad found himself struggling in deep water. and now look here see what youve been and done lost me my boat that i was so fond of thats what youve done whats become of them the dear fellows he came solemnly up to toad shook him by the paw and said welcome home toad alas what am i saying home indeed fancy having you back again and he began to dance round him. clever o no he said. im not really clever according to my friends. ive only broken out of the strongest prison in england thats all o no im a stupid ass i am not a bite since breakfast o my thats not so bad is it for a few minutes work and how do you think i done it mole toad do be quiet please said the rat. the badger and i have been round and round the place by night and by day always the same thing. how they do laugh but i think i see now in the depths of my mind what toad really ought to do. i will tell you. nothing of the sort you dont understand. im not going to be ordered about by you fellows its my house were talking about and i know exactly what to do and ill tell you. it was the badger who having finished his pie had turned round in his chair and was looking at them severely. when he saw that he had secured their attention and that they were evidently waiting for him to address them he turned back to the table again and reached out for the cheese. at last he spoke. toad he said severely. there there went on the badger more kindly. never mind. stop crying. but what the mole says is quite true. there are more ways of getting back a place than taking it by storm. i havent said my last word yet. i know every inch of toad hall inside and out. i have the gift of conversation. never mind. go on badger. hows this passage of yours going to help us
ive found out a thing or two lately continued the badger. theres going to be a big banquet tomorrow night. exactly said the badger that is my point. and that is where the passage comes in.  and rush in upon them said the badger. so as its getting very late all of you go right off to bed at once. he slept till a late hour next morning and by the time he got down he found that the other animals had finished their breakfast some time before. the mole had slipped off somewhere by himself without telling any one where he was going to. ill learn em to steal my house he cried. whats the matter with his english we want to learn em learn em learn em and whats more were going to do it too
oh very well have it your own way said the rat. presently the mole came tumbling into the room evidently very pleased with himself. i got the idea when i went into the kitchen to see about toads breakfast being kept hot for him. so i put it on and the bonnet as well and the shawl and off i went to toad hall as bold as you please. the fact is he felt exceedingly jealous of mole for what he had just done. the badger laid down his paper. good mole the return of ulysses 
when it began to grow dark the rat with an air of excitement and mystery summoned them back into the parlour stood each of them up alongside of his little heap and proceeded to dress them up for the coming expedition. it was cold and dark and damp and low and narrow and poor toad began to shiver partly from dread of what might be before him partly because he was wet through. what a time theyre having said the badger. follow me
and flung the door open wide. my the affair was soon over. mole he said youre the best of fellows its all over he reported. now theres just one more thing i want you to do mole before you sit down to your supper along of us and i wouldnt trouble you only i know i can trust you to see a thing done and i wish i could say the same of every one i know. id send rat if he wasnt a poet. and then come along and have some of this cold tongue. its first rate. after a time he appeared again smiling and said that every room was ready and as clean as a new pin. but toad knew his man so he sat down and made the best breakfast he could merely observing to himself that he would get square with the others sooner or later. when he had nearly finished the badger looked up and remarked rather shortly im sorry toad but im afraid theres a heavy mornings work in front of you. though why on earth you should want to have a banquet in the morning i cannot understand. and ill bear a hand too and take my share of the burden. certainly not ill be ill see you  stop a minute though why of course dear badger you wish it done and it shall be done. a fine idea had occurred to him while he was talking. . . . by toad. address. . . song. . . . by toad. composed by himself. by toad   will be sung in the course of the evening   by the. . . toad rather suspected what he was after and did his best to get away but when the badger took him firmly by the other arm he began to see that the game was up. now look here toad said the rat. its about this banquet and very sorry i am to have to speak to you like this. they understood him they saw through him they had got ahead of him. at last he raised his head and the traces of strong emotion were visible on his features. however you are right i know and i am wrong. hence forth i will be a very different toad. my friends you shall never have occasion to blush for me again. but the thing had to be done. gradually his countenance cleared and he began to smile long slow smiles. toads last little song the toad came home when the toad came home the badger had ordered everything of the best and the banquet was a great success. at intervals he stole a glance at the badger and the rat and always when he looked they were staring at each other with their mouths open and this gave him the greatest satisfaction. speech speech from toad song he was indeed an altered toad there goes the great mr. toad asked mamma anxiously. but it is always the same and there isnt any more surprise about it. dont like some of them and soon get tired of those i do like. we always have a great dinner and i eat too much and feel ill next day. and effie laid herself flat on the sofa as if the mere idea was too much for her. asked mamma anxious to please her spoiled child. asked mamma wondering what would come next. this girl out here has a basket of scraps on her arm and a big old shawl all round her and doesnt seem to care a bit though the water runs out of the toes of her boots. some of it she did not understand but she laughed and cried over many parts of the charming story and felt better without knowing why. so it is no wonder that she dreamed all night and this was the dream which she never quite forgot. she found herself sitting on a stone in the middle of a great field all alone. the snow was falling fast a bitter wind whistled by and night was coming on. she felt hungry cold and tired and did not know where to go nor what to do. but the more she thought about it the more bewildered she felt. far away a dim light shone and a voice was heard singing. a childs voice sang a childs hand carried the little candle and in the circle of soft light it shed effie saw a pretty child coming to her through the night and snow. asked effie looking for the wings. that is what we love to do. bells were ringing so merrily that it was hard to keep from dancing. no one was forgotten. and the spirit smiled as if he enjoyed some joke which she did not see. like a flash that bright world vanished and effie found herself in a part of the city she had never seen before. but the sweetest work was for the children and effie held her breath to watch these human fairies hang up and fill the little stockings without which a childs christmas is not perfect putting in things that once she would have thought very humble presents but which now seemed beautiful and precious because these poor babies had nothing. i have shown you the way. as he spoke the spirit seemed to put his arms about her and vanished with a kiss. cried effie trying to hold him fast. did you hear the bells she asked rubbing her eyes and looking about her for the pretty child who was so real and sweet. we will do it how ive got it the new idea. sung mamma evidently charmed with her happy thought. and mamma laughed at effies bewildered face. asked effie anxiously for it seemed an immense time to wait till another evening came. better than i expected for several of my good friends are helping or i couldnt have done it as i wish. mamma gave her a very tender kiss and effie went to bed. to her and the dinner was just as usual to her. its the prettiest idea i ever heard of. cried effie more than once and she kept her eye on the clock for at seven in the evening the surprise was to come off. who is it for what is that noise cried effie pale with pleasure and surprise as she stood looking down the brilliant little street from her high place. she shall play the good fairy and give each of you something from this tree after which every one will find her own name on a small tree and can go to enjoy it in her own way. how they ran to show one another the new treasures mamma kissed every one and many a hungry childish heart felt as if the touch of those tender lips was their best gift. and effie fell asleep with a happy smile on her lips her one humble gift still in her hand and a new love for christmas in her heart that never changed through a long life spent in doing good. ii. the dear red umbrella flew away like a leaf and lily fell down down till she went crash into a tree which grew in such a curious place that she forgot her fright as she sat looking about her wondering what part of the world it could be. oh how good it was all sugar and no stone. sweet so little dear   pray feel no fear   go where you will   eat eat your fill. sweet sweet lily soon learned to know the characters of her new friends by a single taste and some she never touched but once. these they could eat and lily thought this much better than throwing away the pies as she had to do at home. then the little pair would drive away in a fine carriage with white horses to a new palace in some other part of the country and lily would have another pleasant place to visit. and bit his head off crown and all. id like to see how you live and what you do. come on she liked the queer fellow and presently began to talk being very curious about this country. lily thought it a good one for he was very quick and she fancied he could be short and sharp if he liked. the gingerbread family have never been as foolish as some of the other cakes. no substance. ladies fingers will do for babies but pound has too much butter ever to be healthy. lily ran behind to pick up whatever fell and looked about her as she went for this was certainly a very queer country. it was a very busy place for every one cooked all the time and never failed and never seemed tired though they got so hot that they only wore sheets of paper for clothes. its one of the secrets of the trade. lily was so surprised she sat down on a warm queens cake that happened to be near and watched snap send down load after load of gingerbread to be eaten by children who would have liked it much better if they had only known where it came from as she did. its a great art and worth knowing. dont waste your time on cake though plain gingerbread isnt bad to have in the house. and lily fell to work with all her might after snap had put on her a paper apron and a cap like his. now you know. your task is done   a soul is won. away away im free suddenly a cry was heard and up rose a beautiful white figure on the farther side of the sea. two of these figures came running to meet her as she slowly walked down the yellow path from the hill. asked lily feeling as if she had seen both these little people before and liked them. we begin in that way and work up to the perfect loaf by degrees. asked lily when she got her breath again. i think youll like it. when all were seated she began with the wheat ear and told them all about it in such an interesting way that lily felt as if she had never known anything about the bread she ate before. cried lily. mamma will be so pleased if i can make good bread when i go home. learn all you can and tell other people how to make healthy bodies and happy souls by eating good plain food. but at last when she had made the perfect loaf she wanted to go home that her mother might see and taste it. im sorry to have you go but i dont wonder you want to see your mother. iii. but he didnt seem to be a lively monkey for he sat in a bunch with his sad face turned anxiously to his master who kept pulling the chain to make him dance. he tried to dance but was so weak he could only hop a few steps and stop panting for breath. i dont want him. the man said he was going on for a week through the towns near by and would call and see about it when he came back. then he took his naughty pet and started to go home and tie him up for it was plain this monkey was not to be trusted. oh such a time but he wasnt sorry. oh dear no sent aunt jane to see what was going on. what shall i do iv. once there was a little girl named kitty who never wanted to do what people asked her. but the words were hardly out of her mouth when the shoes gave one jump and took her downstairs through the hall and landed her at the kitchen door. her breath was nearly gone but she gave the message and turned round trying to see if the shoes would let her walk at all. she was forbidden to touch it but loved to take a bit when she could. cried kitty and she did not till the shoes took her straight into the office. the shoes walked nicely along till she came to the bridge and there she wanted to stop and watch some boys in a boat forgetting school and her fathers letters. her feet went on and when she sat down they still dragged her along so steadily that she had to go and she got up feeling that there was something very strange about these shoes. but not a button could she stir though she got red and angry struggling to do it. but she did for those magic shoes danced her off and landed her at her desk in five minutes. up went her foot but it didnt come down it stayed in the air and there she stood looking as if she were going to dance. she began to see how they worked and thought she would try if she had any power over them. cried the boys much surprised for not one of them dared try such a high leap. kitty laughed and began to dance feeling pleased and proud to find there was a good side to the shoes after all. but she was mistaken. on the way home she wanted to stop and see her friend bells new doll but at the gate her feet stuck fast and she had to give up her wishes and go straight on as mamma had told her always to do. said her mother. but you may do as you choose about it. kitty sat very still and sober for some time and no one spoke to her. the shoes went quietly along and seemed to know just where to stop. the words were hardly out of her mouth when her feet folded under her and there she sat on a cushion of moss like the queen of the wood on her throne. if you didnt have those shoes on you couldnt understand what i say. hark and hear those squirrels talk and the birds and the ants down here. do not stop to play   wander far and wide     gather all you may. he chased them away from the pan where the meal was and picked the down off their necks if they tried to get their share. his mother scolded him when the little ones ran to hide under her wings but he didnt care and was very naughty. early in the morning for he woke before the sun was up and began his song. he said he didnt care but he did and was very unhappy and used to go and peep into the pleasant field where the fowls scratched and talked together. he dared not show himself for they would have driven him out. and with a jump he seized peck by the head before he could explain the mistake. hear farmer hunts cock crow. she was right for once and this is what he did. one day the farmer had to go away and stay all night leaving the old lady alone with two boys. they were not afraid for they had a gun and quite longed for a chance to fire it. now it happened that the farmer had a good deal of money in the house and some bad men knew it so they waited for him to go away that they might steal it. at midnight the men came creeping along one stopped outside and the other went in. presently he handed a basket of silver out and went back for the money. so loud that it roused the neighbors who came running to see what the trouble could be. asked the people. when the robbers were tried it was found that they were the men who had robbed the bank and taken a great deal of money so every one was glad to have them shut up for twenty years. this was not the end of his good deeds and the last was the best of all though it cost him his life. but he did die at last and even then he was good and brave as you shall hear. he thought he heard his father coming and hid the pipe under the house. some straw and dry leaves lay about and took fire setting the place in a blaze for the boy ran away when he saw the mischief he had done and the fire got to burning nicely before the cries of the poor hens called people to help. alas the hens all hang their heads the chickens sadly peep   the boys look sober and the girls all weep. rosys journey. rosy was a nice little girl who lived with her mother in a small house in the woods. they were very poor for the father had gone away to dig gold and did not come back so they had to work hard to get food to eat and clothes to wear. she was very good and sweet and every one loved her but the neighbors were all poor and could do little to help the child. said the people who were very sorry for her. they all kissed her and wished her good luck and she trotted away through the wood to find her father. but by and by she came to lonely places where there were no houses and then she was afraid and used to climb up in the trees to sleep and had to eat berries and leaves like the children in the wood. she made a fire at night so wild beasts would not come near her and if she met other travellers she was so young and innocent no one had the heart to hurt her. she was kind to everything she met so all little creatures were friends to her as we shall see. one day as she was resting by a river she saw a tiny fish on the bank nearly dead for want of water. laughed rosy. rosy went on her way and forgot all about it. the big spider was trying to spin him all up and the poor fly was struggling to get away before his legs and wings were helpless. the mountains were on the other side but how should she get over the wide water rosy ran to see what he wanted. answered rosy. down dived the little fish and rosy waited to see what would happen for she didnt believe such a tiny thing could really bring a whale to help her. rosy liked it and looked down into the deep sea where all sorts of queer and lovely things were to be seen. so she had a very pleasant voyage and ran on shore with many thanks to the good whale who gave a splendid spout and swam away. then rosy travelled along till she came to a desert. cried rosy much surprised. he said looking at the mouse who was not a bit frightened though rosy hid behind a rock expecting every moment to be eaten. as soon as she got her breath she thought it great fun to go flying along while other lions and tigers rolled their fierce eyes at her but dared not touch her for this lion was king of all and she was quite safe. it looked like a very large monkey in a red cloak but went so fast they never saw that it was a little girl. then away they went again faster than ever till they came to the green country. rosy thanked the good beast and he ran back for if any one saw him they would try to catch him. she started off bravely but took the wrong road and after climbing a long while found the path ended in rocks over which she could not go. she was very tired and hungry for her food was gone and there were no houses in this wild place. youll find all the men are down in the mine at this time. they wont come up till morning so you will have to wait for your father. then she knew that this was the right place and she ate some supper put on more wood and went to bed for she wanted to be fresh when her father came in the morning. the river is rising cried rosy watching the men rush about like ants getting their bags of gold ready to carry off before the water swept them away if it became a flood. how can we get them out rosy ran too feeling as if her heart would break for her father was down in the mine and would die soon if air did not come to him. the men dug as hard as they could but it was a long job and they feared they would not be in time. said the men. the men laughed and rosy was telling them who she was when a cry came from the pit and they saw that the way was clear so they could pull the buried men up. toms got it cried the others and then they saw tom come up with the biggest lump of gold ever found in the mountains. every one was glad of toms luck for he was a good man and had worked a long time and been sick and couldnt go back to his wife and child. then rosy was very happy and went back to the hut and had a lovely time telling her father all about her troubles and her travels. he cried when he heard that the poor mother was dead before she could have any of the good things the gold would buy them. how they ran away. asked billy who liked to be comfortable both night and day. i aint afraid. asked billy always ready with a question. away they went deeper and deeper into the great forest that covered the side of the mountain. weve got the wrong basket. why didnt you look you are always in such a hurry to start. said tommy laughing at the other boys dismal face. ill pick the berries and then show you how to get dinner in the woods. while he worked billy ate berries and sighed for bread and butter. come and see billy scrambled out and went as fast as his wet boots would let him to see what the prize was. he found tommy dancing wildly round a fat gray animal who was fighting to get his paws out of the trap and making a queer noise as he struggled about. asked billy getting behind a tree as fast as possible for the thing looked fierce and he was very timid. wont his fur make a fine cap the fellows in my books dont seem to have caught any. answered tommy. asked the man. and the man laughed. said the man looking interested as well as amused. asked the man seeing the hungry look. and the man took up his paper as if glad to be let alone. no hurry we know the way and we want to have some sport first. id rather shoot a bear than any other animal but a lion. we dont have those here and bears are scarce. that was true and the man knew it. he did not really expect or want to meet a bear but thought the idea of one would send the little fellows home at once. such fun billy i know youll like it. a real gun and dog and hunter im tired and im going home you can go after your old bears if you want to. goodby. he tried his bow and shot all his arrows many times in vain for the lively creatures gave him no chance. the poor thing fluttered and fell and its blood wet the green leaves as it lay dying on the grass. once or twice they heard the hunters gun far away and called and tried to find him. tommy scolded billy for not going with the man who knew his way and was probably safe in the valley when the last faint shot came up to them. but alas the matches were left in their first camp so they decided to take turns to sleep and watch since it was plain that they must spend the night there. hurry up and go to sleep the bear dont let him get me how to get him down was the next question. that he was afraid to try for the ground was hard and the fall a high one. i may fall and be killed the bear might come dont go you are safe up there. by and by the sound of a gun roused him and remembering poor billy he tried to get out of the pit for the moon showed him where he was. its rather good fun though if they only find me. i aint afraid and it isnt very cold. i always wanted to sleep out and now im doing it. wish poor billy was safely down and in this good bed with me. wont he be scared all alone there theres the gun again guess its that man after us. here i am hurrah if it hadnt been for him id have kept the lively fellow with me and shown him how to hunt. come along and look for the other one. tommys hat lay on the ground and showing it to the dog his master told him to find the boy. the hunter and several of the men went after him leaving the farmer with the others to take care of billy. cried the men much relieved and rushing on soon saw the good beast looking down at a little white object in one corner of the dark hole. it was tommys face in the moonlight for the rest of him was covered up with leaves. the little round face seemed very quiet and for a moment the men stood quite still fearing that the fall might have done the boy some harm. then the hunter leaped down and gently touched the brown cheek. wake up here little chap you are wanted at home. oh i say wheres billy the fairy box. if you have been good     all through the day   a gift you will find     useful or gay   but if you have been     cross selfish or wild   a bad thing will come     for the naughty child. may was very much surprised at this and looked everywhere to see who spoke but could find no one. tell no one of this. ill try hard and be as good as an angel if i can only get one peep at a live fairy. dont wait to hang up my clothes you slow old thing but may didnt care and felt under her pillow the minute the door was shut. a lamp was always left burning so she could see the little gold box she drew out. oh dear what do you think happened then she lay still and thought about it for she dared not call any one because nobody must guess the secret. at once the smart got better and by the time she had resolved to ask the good old woman to forgive her it was all gone. may turned red and wanted to tell what she had done but was ashamed because there was company and people thought she blushed like a modest little girl at being praised. but when she went to bed she was almost afraid to look under the pillow knowing that she had done wrong. at last she slowly drew out the box and slowly opened it expecting something to fly at her. all she saw was a tiny black bag that began at once to grow larger till it was big enough to hold her two hands. i hope no one will see it when im asleep. she cried herself to sleep and when she woke the bag was gone. no one had seen it but she told her mamma about the cake and promised not to do so any more. but alas she did not tell of it and went to a party in the afternoon where she was so merry she never remembered the naughty thing till she was in bed and opened the fairy box. all the next day she was very careful to keep her lips from cross words her hands from forbidden things and her feet from going wrong. said mamma with many kisses on the rosy cheeks and the smile that was a reward. under her pillow. and she popped up her head to see. may couldnt believe that it was alive till it jumped out of its nest stretched itself and grew all at once just the right size to play with and be pretty. said nurse when she saw the dog in the morning. but she didnt get the pony that night for in the afternoon her mother told her not to sit on the lawn because it was damp and may did not mind being busy with a nice story. my throat is sore and i am hoarse. i wonder how that fairy knew i sat on the damp grass. she said and went to sleep very happily. may was delighted and very proud when the pony let her put on the saddle and bridle that lay in the barn all ready to use. she guessed what it meant and in the morning told her brother to come to the river and see what she had for him. as if eager to try it at once. after that may kept on trying to be good and wishing for things for herself and other people till she forgot how to be naughty and was the sweetest little girl in the world. then there was no need of fairies to help her and one night the box was not under the pillow. farewell little girl     for now we must part. a hole in the wall. the court was a dull place with only two or three shabby houses in it and a high blank wall at the end. soon it was a very gay wall for mother helped standing on a chair to put the large pictures up when johnny had covered all the space he could reach. none were perfect but they were arranged with care and the effect was very fine johnny thought. i know it must be splendid. its all quiet in there now heres a good place and nobody will know if i stick a picture over the hole. puss in her white boots sat aloft and looked on wise as the cat in the story but offered no advice. rather scared by his unexpected success the boy sat silent for a moment to see what would happen. thought the poor boy as he looked from one delight to another and felt shut out from all. i know im so glad. wish i had some more to send over. i wonder where he is among the bushes over there i think. i never saw it before. oh i can see the street. how nice who are you here are some flowers for you. now we will talk. arent they just elegant tell me more. asked the child eagerly. i do a great many. papa shows me how. his are splendid. im too big for that. and johnny took one delicious taste on the spot. i like better to be where its always warm and people are more beautiful than here. thought johnny as he obeyed. i think you are good. and there was another quick rush in the garden followed by the appearance of a fat little book slowly pushed through the hole in the wall. keep it as long as you please. they will be new to me. i thank you. i shall go and read them now and then come and talk again. part ii. all sorts of delightful things happened and good times really seemed to have come. johnny thought so too and dreamed of the happy day when he should go and see the wonders his little friend described so well. and johnny gave a great sigh. im going to learn to mend shoes. and johnny stood up to try his legs for he dreaded the long walk as it seemed to him. im really going tomorrow. on saturday the sun shone johnny was better and the great picture was done. i tried very hard and here are three. i want some money very very much. i know how i shall do it and at once. i will show what i can do. hope the lad is all she says and nothing catching about his illness. time is short but it can be done and to show you that i am in earnest i will go this instant and begin the work. part iii. we are to have two keys and no one     else can open it. a little bell is to ring when we pull the cord and     we can run and see what we want. the paint is wet. papa did it     and the men put up the door last night. i helped them and did not go     in my bed till ten. it was very nice to do it so. i hope you will like     it. come in as soon as you can i am all ready. said johnny leaning back to look at the dear door behind which lay such happiness for him. you shall do come in here also appeared a nice lunch before the visitors could remember it was noon and tear themselves away. johnny thought he couldnt be surprised any more but when he had mounted many stairs and found himself in a great room with a glass roof full of rich curtains strange armor pretty things and pictures everywhere he just sat in the big chair where he was placed and stared in silent delight. she liked it and kept hidden till night then she went home and opened the little window in the store closet and got in and took as many good things to eat and carry away as she liked. no one saw her but the cats and they played with her and hopped at her toes in the moonlight and had great fun. one dreadful night she found out. so she lay trembling till morning then she ran through the garden and found the back door open. she said. oh please dont on the whole there was so much cloud and so little solid earth that it had the effect of a vision. oh no indeed in the first sentence of my book you will recollect that i spoke of a tall youth standing in the midst of the children. but for my part i have seldom met with a pair of eyes that looked as if they could see farther or better than those of eustace bright. his stories are good to hear at night because we can dream about them asleep and good in the morning too because then we can dream about them awake. but children i have already told you so many fairy tales that i doubt whether there is a single one which you have not heard at least twice over. and so he did as you may begin to read on the next page. the young man came to the palace and found the king sitting upon his throne. cried perseus eagerly. they were three sisters and seem to have borne some distant resemblance to women but were really a very frightful and mischievous species of dragon. it is indeed difficult to imagine what hideous beings these three sisters were. but when people happened to catch a glimpse of their glittering brightness aloft in the air they seldom stopped to gaze but ran and hid themselves as speedily as they could. for not to speak of other difficulties there was one which it would have puzzled an older man than perseus to get over. but while he was in this sorrowful mood he heard a voice close beside him. he lifted his head from his hands in which he had hidden it and behold all alone as perseus had supposed himself to be there was a stranger in the solitary place. answered the stranger. perhaps you may have heard of me. i have more names than one but the name of quicksilver suits me as well as any other. the strangers words and manner put perseus into quite a different mood from his former one. he resolved to tell quicksilver all his difficulties since he could not easily be worse off than he already was and very possibly his new friend might give him some advice that would turn out well in the end. exclaimed perseus with the tears again standing in his eyes. repeated perseus. and now we will set out. and then too when perseus looked sideways at him out of the corner of his eye he seemed to see wings on the side of his head although if he turned a full gaze there were no such things to be perceived but only an odd kind of cap. in fact the stick seemed to be alive in his hand and to lend some of its life to perseus. he evidently knew the world and nobody is so charming to a young man as a friend who has that kind of knowledge. at last he happened to recollect that quicksilver had spoken of a sister who was to lend her assistance in the adventure which they were now bound upon. he inquired. by this time it had grown quite dusk. whispered his companion. this is just the time and place to meet the three gray women. quicksilver explained to perseus how the three gray women managed with their one eye. hush the sight of three persons eyes was melted and collected into that single one. my stars it was positively terrible to be within reach of so very sharp an eye the eye is mine as well as yours and i know the use of it as well as you or may be a little better. for my part i shall be glad of a little thick darkness. he whispered to perseus. you have our eye what shall we do we are all in the dark give us our eye give us our one precious solitary eye you have two of your own i am by no means a bad young man. goodness me screamed scarecrow. we know nothing at all about them. we are three unfortunate old souls that go wandering about in the dusk and never had but one eye amongst us and that one you have stolen away. oh give it back good stranger but he took good care to keep out of their reach. his heels would quickly fly higher than his head if he were silly enough to put them on. no no good stranger we can tell you nothing of these marvelous things. you have two eyes of your own and we have but a single one amongst us three. but quicksilver caught his hand. said he. as it turned out quicksilver was in the right. quicksilver and perseus in the mean time were making the best of their way in quest of the nymphs. so perseus proceeded to put one of the slippers on while he laid the other on the ground by his side. making a step or two lo and behold nothing but empty air asked quicksilver. answered perseus very quietly although his voice seemed to come out of the transparent atmosphere. answered his friend. with these words quicksilvers cap spread its wings as if his head were about to fly away from his shoulders but his whole figure rose lightly into the air and perseus followed. it was now deep night. so swift was their flight however that in an instant they emerged from the cloud into the moonlight again. answered quicksilver. we could do nothing without the help of my sister. you have no idea how wise she is. she has such eyes too by this time in their swift voyage through the air they had come within sight of the great ocean and were soon flying over it. just then a voice spoke in the air close by him. exclaimed perseus. and with all this there was something partly human about them too. do not look at her the sight would turn you to stone whispered quicksilver who was growing impatient. but she awoke too late. cried quicksilver. and then the snakes and there perhaps those very feathers lie scattered till this day. finally our brave perseus arrived at the island where he expected to see his dear mother. however seeing him safely returned he put the best face he could upon the matter and asked perseus how he had succeeded. inquired he. yelled the people more fiercely than before. and perseus sighed. cried perseus in a voice like the blast of a trumpet. they were all fixed forever in the look and attitude of that moment asked eustace. i suppose it was a false tooth. but think of your turning mercury into quicksilver and talking about his sister asked eustace bright. oh what a day of indian summer was it going to be behind went a good old dog whose name was ben. hence came the name of shadow brook. so it stole away as quickly as it could and hid itself in the lake. after it was over nobody felt like stirring. this is the consequence of having earned a reputation but cousin eustace as i think i have hinted before was as fond of telling his stories as the children of hearing them. this remark however is not meant for the children to hear. the golden touch 

once upon a time there lived a very rich man and a king besides whose name was midas and he had a little daughter whom nobody but myself ever heard of and whose name i either never knew or have entirely forgotten. but the more midas loved his daughter the more did he desire and seek for wealth. he thought foolish man thus he gave all his thoughts and all his time to this one purpose. it was here that he kept his wealth. midas called himself a happy man but felt that he was not yet quite so happy as he might be. now i need hardly remind such wise little people as you are that in the old old times when king midas was alive a great many things came to pass which we should consider wonderful if they were to happen in our own day and country. and on the other hand a great many things take place nowadays which seem not only wonderful to us but at which the people of old times would have stared their eyes out. it is no matter about telling you who he was. midas had met such beings before now and was not sorry to meet one of them again. it was far more probable that he came to do midas a favor. he observed. exclaimed the stranger. midas shook his head. asked the stranger. at last a bright idea occurred to king midas. exclaimed he. said midas. asked midas. whether midas slept as usual that night the story does not say. at any rate day had hardly peeped over the hills when king midas was broad awake and stretching his arms out of bed began to touch the objects that were within reach. he was anxious to prove whether the golden touch had really come according to the strangers promise. he took up a book from the table. midas now took his spectacles from his pocket and put them on his nose in order that he might see more distinctly what he was about. in those days spectacles for common people had not been invented but were already worn by kings else how could midas have had any to his great perplexity however excellent as the glasses were he discovered that he could not possibly see through them. but midas knew a way to make them far more precious according to his way of thinking than roses had ever been before. by the time this good work was completed king midas was summoned to breakfast and as the morning air had given him an excellent appetite he made haste back to the palace. at all events this is a breakfast fit to set before a king and whether he had it or not king midas could not have had a better. to do midas justice he really loved his daughter and loved her so much the more this morning on account of the good fortune which had befallen him. cried midas. exclaimed her father. as soon as i was dressed i ran into the garden to gather some roses for you because i know you like them and like them the better when gathered by your little daughter. but oh dear dear me what do you think has happened such a misfortune said midas. and what was to be done would he be less so by dinner time but this was only a passing thought. she sat a moment gazing at her father and trying with all the might of her little wits to find out what was the matter with him. he bent down and kissed her. he felt that his little daughters love was worth a thousand times more than he had gained by the golden touch. cried he. alas what had he done how fatal was the gift which the stranger bestowed oh terrible misfortune except when his eyes were fixed on the image he could not possibly believe that she was changed to gold. this however could not be. midas shook his head. exclaimed the stranger. have i not faithfully kept my promise with you observed the stranger. exclaimed midas. said the stranger looking seriously at him. were it so your case would indeed be desperate. replied midas. a fly settled on his nose but immediately fell to the floor for it too had become gold. midas shuddered. he was conscious also of a change within himself. a cold hard and heavy weight seemed to have gone out of his bosom. the curse of the golden touch had therefore really been removed from him. no sooner did it fall on her than you would have laughed to see how the rosy color came back to the dear childs cheek and how astonished she was to find herself dripping wet and her father still throwing more water over her cried she. her father did not think it necessary to tell his beloved child how very foolish he had been but contented himself with showing how much wiser he had now grown. there were two circumstances however which as long as he lived used to put king midas in mind of the golden touch. were i midas i would make nothing else but just such golden days as these over and over again all the year throughout. my best thoughts always come a little too late. i wish primrose were worth half as much. they did so. although yesterday was just such a day and tomorrow will be just such another. cried eustace bright. answered primrose laughing. you may read it word for word in the pages that come next. her name was pandora. the first thing that pandora saw when she entered the cottage where epimetheus dwelt was a great box. asked pandora. it is thousands of years since epimetheus and pandora were alive and the world nowadays is a very different sort of thing from what it was in their time. then everybody was a child. it was a very pleasant life indeed. oh what a good time was that to be alive in pandora continually kept saying to herself and to epimetheus. said epimetheus at last for he had grown extremely tired of the subject. this ugly box i am so taken up with thinking about it all the time. replied epimetheus getting a little vexed. exclaimed epimetheus. still however she could not help thinking and talking about the box. asked pandora. cried epimetheus. it was quicksilver and he brought me hither as well as the box. muttered pandora as epimetheus left the cottage. for the first time since her arrival epimetheus had gone out without asking pandora to accompany him. he was tired to death of hearing about the box and heartily wished that quicksilver or whatever was the messengers name had left it at some other childs door where pandora would never have set eyes on it. the box the box and nothing but the box after epimetheus was gone pandora stood gazing at the box. as the child had no other lookingglass it is odd that she did not value the box merely on this account. but here and there peeping forth from behind the carved foliage pandora once or twice fancied that she saw a face not so lovely or something or other that was disagreeable and which stole the beauty out of all the rest. nevertheless on looking more closely and touching the spot with her finger she could discover nothing of the kind. the most beautiful face of all was done in what is called high relief in the centre of the lid. pandora had looked at this face a great many times and imagined that the mouth could smile if it liked or be grave when it chose the same as any living mouth. the features indeed all wore a very lively and rather mischievous expression which looked almost as if it needs must burst out of the carved lips and utter itself in words. what harm can there be in opening the box never mind that poor simple epimetheus you are wiser than he and have ten times as much spirit. there appeared to be no end to this knot and no beginning. there would be no harm in that surely. even epimetheus would not blame me for that. but children led so easy a life before any troubles came into the world that they had really a great deal too much leisure. when life is all sport toil is the real play. there was absolutely nothing to do. and then for the rest of the day there was the box after all i am not quite sure that the box was not a blessing to her in its way. it supplied her with such a variety of ideas to think of and to talk about whenever she had anybody to listen and many a kick did the box but it was a mischievous box as we shall see and deserved all it got many a kick did it receive. what could it be indeed do you think that you should be less curious than pandora but you would not do it. no no only if you thought there were toys in it it would be so very hard to let slip an opportunity of taking just one peep but pandora was convinced that there was something very beautiful and valuable in the box and therefore she felt just as anxious to take a peep as any of these little girls here around me would have felt. and possibly a little more so but of that i am not quite so certain. on this particular day however which we have so long been talking about her curiosity grew so much greater than it usually was that at last she approached the box. she was more than half determined to open it if she could. ah naughty pandora first however she tried to lift it. it was heavy quite too heavy for the slender strength of a child like pandora. a moment afterwards she almost fancied that she heard something stir inside of the box. or was it merely the singing in pandoras ears or could it be the beating of her heart the child could not quite satisfy herself whether she had heard anything or no. but at all events her curiosity was stronger than ever. as she drew back her head her eyes fell upon the knot of gold cord. meanwhile the bright sunshine came through the open window as did likewise the merry voices of the children playing at a distance and perhaps the voice of epimetheus among them. pandora stopped to listen. what a beautiful day it was said pandora. nothing was to be done therefore but to let the box remain as it was until epimetheus should come in. and then the thought came into her naughty little heart that since she would be suspected of having looked into the box she might just as well do so at once. oh very naughty and very foolish pandora thought pandora. well yes i am resolved to take just one peep only one peep and then the lid shall be shut down as safely as ever but it is now time for us to see what epimetheus was doing. but nothing went right nor was he nearly so happy as on other days. for you must recollect that at the time we are speaking of it was everybodys nature and constant habit to be happy. the world had not yet learned to be otherwise. not a single soul or body since these children were first sent to enjoy themselves on the beautiful earth had ever been sick or out of sorts. but with a hope of giving her pleasure he gathered some flowers and made them into a wreath which he meant to put upon her head. she was too intent upon her purpose. at the moment of his entering the cottage the naughty child had put her hand to the lid and was on the point of opening the mysterious box. epimetheus beheld her. but epimetheus himself although he said very little about it had his own share of curiosity to know what was inside. and if there were anything pretty or valuable in the box he meant to take half of it to himself. so whenever we blame pandora for what happened we must not forget to shake our heads at epimetheus likewise. as pandora raised the lid the cottage grew very dark and dismal for the black cloud had now swept quite over the sun and seemed to have buried it alive. cried he. naughty pandora pandora let fall the lid and starting up looked about her to see what had befallen epimetheus. now if you wish to know what these ugly things might be which had made their escape out of the box i must tell you that they were the whole family of earthly troubles. had they been faithful to their trust all would have gone well. no grown person would ever have been sad nor any child have had cause to shed a single tear from that hour until this moment. meanwhile the naughty pandora and hardly less naughty epimetheus remained in their cottage. besides all this they were in exceedingly bad humor both with themselves and with one another. she was crying bitterly and sobbing as if her heart would break. suddenly there was a gentle little tap on the inside of the lid. cried pandora lifting her head. but either epimetheus had not heard the tap or was too much out of humor to notice it. at any rate he made no answer. again the tap asked pandora with a little of her former curiosity. you are inside of the box naughty creature and there you shall stay there are plenty of your ugly brothers and sisters already flying about the world. they are no brothers and sisters of mine as you would see at once if you were only to get a glimpse of me. come come my pretty pandora epimetheus too though still in the corner had turned half round and seemed to be in rather better spirits than before. asked pandora. come my dear pandora lift up the lid. i am in a great hurry to comfort you. so with one consent the two children again lifted the lid. inquired pandora. never fear exclaimed pandora. there may come times and seasons now and then when you will think that i have utterly vanished. cried epimetheus and pandora both in one breath. and so they did and not only they but so has everybody trusted hope that has since been alive. i have felt them already and expect to feel them more as i grow older. what in the world could we do without her dont you think her the exact picture of yourself answered eustace. i know there is not trouble enough in the world to fill such a great box as that. poor fellow meantime the day was drawing towards its close. out of doors the scene certainly looked dreary. how exceedingly pleasant why what could have become of the child then there was a great laugh. and it being now almost sunset eustace thought that he had never beheld anything so fresh and beautiful as the scene. when the sun was fairly down our friend eustace went home to eat his supper. cried the student looking over his shoulder with the pen between his fingers. said primrose. exclaimed the student rather vexed. and so he had. all had heard of them but nobody remembered to have seen any. many of them returned no more none of them brought back the apples. no wonder that they found it impossible to gather them it is said that there was a dragon beneath the tree with a hundred terrible heads fifty of which were always on the watch while the other fifty slept. in my opinion it was hardly worth running so much risk for the sake of a solid golden apple. as he went on his way he continually inquired whether that were the right road to the famous garden. but none of the country people knew anything about the matter and many looked as if they would have laughed at the question if the stranger had not carried so very big a club. but on hearing the strangers question they dropped all their flowers on the grass and gazed at him with astonishment. cried one. but then the dragon with a hundred heads no matter for the golden apples no matter for the king your cruel cousin so i was forced to bury it under a stone where it is doubtless alive to this very day. and he had fought with a very odd race of people half horses and half men and had put them all to death from a sense of duty in order that their ugly figures might never be seen any more. besides all this he took to himself great credit for having cleaned out a stable. asked one of the young maidens with a smile. this was a very odd and frightful sort of figure as you may well believe. on hearing his footsteps at a little distance it was no more than reasonable to judge that several people must be coming. six legs and one gigantic body it looked all like a huge bunch of flowers. but still he was not satisfied. they exclaimed. hercules shook his head. repeated hercules laughing at this odd name. you must talk with this old man of the sea. but before he was out of hearing one of the maidens called after him. they talked about the hero long after he was gone. what they have already done seems less than nothing. what they have taken in hand to do seems worth toil danger and life itself. but was it really and truly an old man but hercules the instant he set eyes on this strange figure was convinced that it could be no other than the old one who was to direct him on his way. as you may easily imagine the old man of the sea awoke in a fright. but his astonishment could hardly have been greater than was that of hercules the next moment. but still he kept fast hold. but the bird could not get away. but hercules would not let him go. but hercules held on. roared the mighty stranger. when the old fellow heard who it was that had caught him he saw with half an eye that it would be necessary to tell him everything that he wanted to know. but suddenly as he looked towards the horizon he saw something a great way off which he had not seen the moment before. and true enough what a cup it must have been as soon as this happened he knew what was to be done for he had not gone through so many remarkable adventures without learning pretty well how to conduct himself whenever anything came to pass a little out of the common rule. and on that island what do you think he saw no you will never guess it not if you were to try fifty thousand times it positively appears to me that this was the most marvelous spectacle that had ever been seen by hercules in the whole course of his wonderful travels and adventures. it was a giant this does really seem almost too much to believe. what the sky was to the giant such are the cares of earth to those who let themselves be weighed down by them. poor fellow he had evidently stood there a long while. ho roared the giant in a fit of immense laughter. cried hercules getting a little angry at the giants mirth. at last the storm swept over as suddenly as it had come. asked the giant. you seem to be a fellow of some strength. he inquired. next he slowly lifted one of his feet out of the forest that had grown up around it then the other. then he laughed ho ho ho at last the gigantic shape faded entirely out of view. if any such misfortune were to happen how could he ever get rid of the sky he began to be afraid that the giant would never come back. i took the finest that grew on the tree i assure you. ah yes and the dragon with a hundred heads is a sight worth any mans seeing. i heartily thank you for your trouble. you are certainly a very strong man and can never have a better opportunity to prove it. i want to make a cushion of my lions skin for the weight to rest upon. quoth the giant for he had no unkind feeling towards hercules and was merely acting with a too selfish consideration of his own ease. only for five minutes recollect he threw down the golden apples and received back the sky from the head and shoulders of hercules upon his own where it rightly belonged. cried the student. this giant now they are the common property of the world and of all time. and was cousin eustace with the party of that you may be certain else how could the book go on a step farther they had done with summer before the summer came. there is something we hope more interesting to be talked about. if you look at the group of children you may see them all gathered around eustace bright who sitting on the stump of a tree seems to be just beginning a story. as for the story i was there to hear it hidden behind a bush and shall tell it over to you in the pages that come next. but the rude shouts of children and the fierce barking of dogs in the village near at hand grew louder and louder until at last it was hardly possible for baucis and philemon to hear each other speak. said baucis. these old folks you must know were quite poor and had to work pretty hard for a living. this valley in past ages when the world was new had probably been the bed of a lake. you will hardly believe what i am going to tell you. this was a very terrible thing to poor travelers as you may suppose especially when they chanced to be sick or feeble or lame or old. observed the good old man. answered his good old wife. a little farther off ran a crowd of children who sent up shrill cries and flung stones at the two strangers with all their might. once or twice the younger of the two men he was a slender and very active figure turned about and drove back the dogs with a staff which he carried in his hand. accordingly she hastened into the cottage. one thing certainly seemed queer. the traveler was so wonderfully light and active that it appeared as if his feet sometimes rose from the ground of their own accord or could only be kept down by an effort. said he. by this time philemon and his two guests had reached the cottage door. my good wife baucis has gone to see what you can have for supper. the staff seemed to get up from the ground of its own accord and spreading its little pair of wings it half hopped half flew and leaned itself against the wall of the cottage. before he could ask any questions the elder stranger drew his attention from the wonderful staff by speaking to him. he shook his head too so that his dark and heavy curls were shaken with the movement. but in a moment afterwards the strangers face became so kindly and mild that the old man quite forgot his terror. repeated philemon looking in the travelers face to see if he were making fun of him. and your companion there replied quicksilver putting on a mysterious look. he told what excellent butter and cheese baucis made and how nice were the vegetables which he raised in his garden. he said too that because they loved one another so very much it was the wish of both that death might not separate them but that they should die as they had lived together. but i took the most part of todays milk to make cheese and our last loaf is already half eaten. ah me and you shall see how bravely i will play my part at it whispered baucis to her husband. they all went into the cottage. quicksilvers staff you recollect had set itself up against the wall of the cottage. there was a pretty good bunch of grapes for each of the guests. alas but the truth is there is hardly a drop more milk in the pitcher. o husband husband so saying and to the vast astonishment of baucis he proceeded to fill not only his own bowl but his companions likewise from the pitcher that was supposed to be almost empty. the good woman could scarcely believe her eyes. she had certainly poured out nearly all the milk and had peeped in afterwards and seen the bottom of the pitcher as she set it down upon the table. i suppose i must have made a mistake. of course there could not possibly be any left. yet what other loaf could it possibly be but oh the honey never was such honey tasted seen or smelt. although good mother baucis was a simple old dame she could not but think that there was something rather out of the common way in all that had been going on. so after helping the guests to bread and honey and laying a bunch of grapes by each of their plates she sat down by philemon and told him what she had seen in a whisper. asked she. if i had poured out the milk i should have seen through the business at once. each of the guests had now taken his bunch of grapes upon his plate. cried he even more bewildered than his wife had been. the supper being now over the strangers requested to be shown to their place of repose. i cant tell what to make of my staff. it is always playing such odd tricks as this sometimes getting me a supper and quite as often stealing it away. when left alone the good old couple spent some little time in conversation about the events of the evening and then lay down on the floor and fell fast asleep. and as for quicksilver with his keen quick laughing wits he appeared to discover every little thought that but peeped into their minds before they suspected it themselves. exclaimed philemon when they had walked a little way from their door. on which side of us does it lie but what was their astonishment there was no longer any appearance of a village for an instant the lake remained perfectly smooth. the lake seemed so strangely familiar that the old couple were greatly perplexed and felt as if they could only have been dreaming about a village having lain there. the village had been there yesterday and now was gone you have done well my dear old friends. philemon and baucis looked at one another and then i know not which of the two it was who spoke but that one uttered the desire of both their hearts. replied the stranger with majestic kindness. they did so. the old folks fell on their knees to thank him but behold neither he nor quicksilver was there. thus the old couple lived in their palace a great great while and grew older and older and very old indeed. and then there was a deep broad murmur in the air as if the two mysterious trees were speaking. murmured the oak. baucis baucis as if one were both and both were one and talking together in the depths of their mutual heart. inquired the little boy. cried all the children at once. on the highest point of the hill was a heap of stones in the centre of which was stuck a long pole with a little flag fluttering at the end of it. but by and by the sunshine was where the shadow had been and the shadow was somewhere else. take some lofty subject or other and see if your imagination will not come up to it. i thank you pretty maiden for telling me its name. but pray have you lost a horse i see you carry the bridle in your hand and a very pretty one it is with that double row of bright stones upon it. but then the country fellow laughed. there was nothing else like him in the world. oh how fine a thing it is to be a winged horse in another instant it is true both pegasus and the pleasant light would be gone away together. but any one that was fortunate enough to see this wondrous spectacle felt cheerful the whole day afterwards and as much longer as the storm lasted. but of late years he had been very seldom seen. indeed there were many of the country folks dwelling within half an hours walk of the fountain who had never beheld pegasus and did not believe that there was any such creature in existence. and that was the reason why he laughed. a winged horse truly why friend are you in your senses of what use would wings be to a horse to be sure there might be a little saving in the expense of shoes but then how would a man like to see his horse flying out of the stable window no no i dont believe in pegasus. inquired he. said the aged man. but nowadays i hardly know what to think and very seldom think about the winged horse at all. if i ever saw the creature it was a long long while ago and to tell you the truth i doubt whether i ever did see him. asked bellerophon of the girl who stood with the pitcher on her head while this talk went on. my very heart leaped with delight at the sound. said bellerophon. and he turned to the child whom i mentioned at the beginning of the story and who was gazing at him as children are apt to gaze at strangers with his rosy mouth wide open. said bellerophon drawing the child closer to him. and sometimes when i look down into the water i see the image of the winged horse in the picture of the sky that is there. i wish he would come down and take me on his back and let me ride him up to the moon he kept continually on the watch looking upward at the sky or else down into the water hoping forever that he should see either the reflected image of the winged horse or the marvelous reality. and we shall find no better opportunity to speak about this matter than while he is waiting for pegasus to appear. if i were to relate the whole of bellerophons previous adventures they might easily grow into a very long story. and a hot blast of fire came flaming out of each of its three mouths oh the mischief and mischief and mischief that this naughty creature did it laid waste the whole country round about and used to eat up people and animals alive and cook them afterwards in the burning oven of its stomach. and what other horse in all the world was half so fleet as the marvelous horse pegasus who had wings as well as legs and was even more active in the air than on the earth it was an enchanted bridle. how hard a lesson it is to wait our life is brief and how much of it is spent in teaching us only this well was it for bellerophon that the gentle child had grown so fond of him and was never weary of keeping him company. every morning the child gave him a new hope to put in his bosom instead of yesterdays withered one. in the afternoon there they sat and bellerophon had thrown his arm around the child who likewise had put one of his little hands into bellerophons. said he. whispered the child. it is very beautiful and yet i dare only look at its image in the water. dear bellerophon do you not see that it is no bird for it was really the winged horse. it was beautiful to see him this one solitary creature whose mate had never been created but who needed no companion and living a great many hundred years was as happy as the centuries were long. the more he did such things as mortal horses are accustomed to do the less earthly and the more wonderful he seemed. yes there he sat on the back of the winged horse a bound indeed i cannot tell you half that he did. he flung out his heels behind and put down his head between his legs with his wings pointing right upward. he twisted his head about and looking bellerophon in the face with fire flashing from his eyes made a terrible attempt to bite him. and pegasus seemed to feel it so likewise. thus it always is with winged horses and with all such wild and solitary creatures. while pegasus had been doing his utmost to shake bellerophon off his back he had flown a very long distance and they had come within sight of a lofty mountain by the time the bit was in his mouth. the young man accordingly leaped from his steeds back but still held him fast by the bridle. said he. and bellerophon was afraid that he should never behold him more. after this trial there was no more fear of the winged horses making his escape. he and bellerophon were friends and put loving faith in one another. and they awoke at peep of day and bade one another good morning each in his own language. they visited distant countries and amazed the inhabitants who thought that the beautiful young man on the back of the winged horse must have come down out of the sky. a thousand miles a day was no more than an easy space for the fleet pegasus to pass over. at first there appeared to be nothing remarkable. he made a sign which the winged horse understood and sunk slowly through the air until his hoofs were scarcely more than a mans height above the rocky bottom of the valley. and what else did bellerophon behold there there seemed to be a heap of strange and terrible creatures curled up within the cavern. the lion and the goat were asleep the snake was broad awake and kept staring around him with a great pair of fiery eyes. the snake the lion and the goat as he supposed them to be were not three separate creatures but one monster but the winged horse was not to be caught so. cried bellerophon. and again he shook the bridle. but this time neither he nor pegasus escaped so well as at first. but this was nothing to what followed. over the upper edge of the shield he looked sternly into the savage eyes of the monster. and when bellerophon had won the victory he bent forward and kissed pegasus while the tears stood in his eyes. said he. said the country fellow. but the poor maiden said nothing for she had always the luck to be afraid at the wrong time. said the child softly. thou my beloved little friend hast done it all. so he slipped off the enchanted bridle from the head of the marvelous steed. but pegasus rested his head on bellerophons shoulder and would not be persuaded to take flight. then bellerophon embraced the gentle child and promised to come to him again and departed. for gentle and tender as he was he grew to be a mighty poet all their eyes were dancing in their heads except those of primrose. asked primrose. exclaimed primrose. said primrose half aside. it delighted me to receive mr. bright for the first time under a roof though a very humble one which i could really call my own. i inquired. after that it falls into its true place quietly enough. how was the blessed sunshine to be thrown into them a few years will do all that is necessary towards showing him the truth in both respects. heaven bless them and everybody else whether grown people or children as for his father the boy had never seen him. the men and women over whom he rules are in the place of children to him and he can seldom spare time to love his own children as other parents do. the little fellow had a great opinion of his own strength. she could not help being sorrowful at finding him already so impatient to begin his adventures in the world. often and often after this did theseus ask his mother whether it was yet time for him to go to athens and still his mother pointed to the rock and told him that for years to come he could not be strong enough to move it. meanwhile the rock seemed to be sinking farther and farther into the ground. to all appearance the rock was as firmly fastened as any other portion of the earths substance. his mother hastily answered. i am no longer a child nor a boy nor a mere youth i feel myself a man he put his whole brave heart into the effort. the great rock stirred while taking breath he looked joyfully at his mother and she smiled upon him through her tears. when he went to be king of athens he bade me treat you as a child until you should prove yourself a man by lifting this heavy stone. cried theseus. but his mother persuaded him to stay a day or two longer while she got ready some necessary articles for his journey. his fame traveled faster than he did and reached athens before him. he little suspected innocent youth that he was that here in this very athens where his father reigned a greater danger awaited him than any which he had encountered on the road. yet this was the truth. you must understand that the father of theseus though not very old in years was almost worn out with the cares of government and had thus grown aged before his time. theseus consented for he fancied that his father would know him in a moment by the love that was in his heart. cried the old king on hearing this. in reply to this question the wicked medea put in her word. as i have already told you she was a famous enchantress. so when the king asked what he should do with theseus this naughty woman had an answer ready at her tongues end. as to what it is made of that is one of my secrets of state. as she said this medea smiled but for all her smiling face she meant nothing less than to poison the poor innocent theseus before his fathers eyes. and this was what theseus resolved to do. advancing to the foot of the throne he attempted to make a little speech which he had been thinking about as he came up the stairs. the cunning medea observed what was passing in the young mans mind. she whispered in the kings ear. the wretch lives too long quick this is the very sword with which he meant to slay you. how sharp and bright and terrible it is quick theseus held out his hand to take the wine. the whole people of athens too who had run out of doors to see this wonderful spectacle set up a shout of joy at the prospect of getting rid of her. and now prince theseus was taken into great favor by his royal father. the occasion of it was as follows
one morning when prince theseus awoke he fancied that he must have had a very sorrowful dream and that it was still running in his mind even now that his eyes were opened. theseus however felt that he was in the right and therefore would not give up his resolution. a sorrowful multitude accompanied them to the shore. there was the poor old king too leaning on his sons arm and looking as if his single heart held all the grief of athens. theseus promised that he would do so. and though it was a sad business enough i rather question whether fourteen young people without any old persons to keep them in order could continue to spend the whole time of the voyage in being miserable. that sight to be sure made them all very grave again. he inquired of the master of the vessel. the figure looked all the more terrible because it carried an enormous brass club on its shoulder. theseus asked of the master of the vessel who was now at leisure to answer him. asked theseus. shouted the master in reply. but when his eyes rested on theseus the king looked at him more attentively because his face was calm and brave. cried the king laughing in his cruel way. but theseus was not like them. she whispered. stay take the end of this silken string i will hold the other end and then if you win the victory it will lead you again to this spot. o indeed i can assure you there was a vast deal of human sympathy running along that slender thread of silk. sure enough what an ugly monster it was ah was theseus afraid what a hero like theseus afraid but theseus by this time had leaped up and caught the monster off his guard. so now the battle was ended. my father is old and has nobody but myself to love him. hard as you think his heart is it would break to lose me. i have saved you theseus as much for my fathers sake as for your own. farewell but here i am grieved to tell you happened a sad misfortune. this was melancholy news for prince theseus who when he stepped ashore found himself king of all the country whether he would or no and such a turn of fortune was enough to make any young man feel very much out of spirits. the pygmies. and o my stars now these funny pygmies as i told you before had a giant for their neighbor and brother who was bigger if possible than they were little. and on their parts the pygmies loved antaeus with as much affection as their tiny hearts could hold. in short as i said before antaeus loved the pygmies and the pygmies loved antaeus. indeed it has always seemed to me that the giant needed the little people more than the pygmies needed the giant. no other being like himself had ever been created. when he stood with his head among the clouds he was quite alone and had been so for hundreds of years and would be so forever. they said one to another. he is not half so bright as we are to be sure and for that reason he needs us to look after his comfort and happiness. let us be kind to the old fellow. ho the pygmies had but one thing to trouble them in the world. but soon he saw the mountain move. dont you see im sleepy he was soon so nigh that there could be no possible mistake about the matter. growled the sleepy giant. and in truth what a pair of shoulders they must have been antaeus could not endure to have it said that any mortal was half so mighty as himself. there was one strange thing about antaeus of which i have not yet told you lest hearing of so many wonders all in a lump you might not believe much more than half of them. but only think of it and whenever he flung himself on the earth to take a little repose even if he got up the very next instant he would be as strong as exactly ten just such giants as his former self. but the stranger did not seem at all disturbed. roared antaeus again. why do you come hither as for my name it is hercules. his one eye was nothing but a circle of red flame. watching his opportunity as the mad giant made a rush at him hercules caught him round the middle with both hands lifted him high into the air and held him aloft overhead. just imagine it my dear little friends. hercules had guessed this secret and it may be well for us all to remember it in case we should ever have to fight a battle with a fellow like antaeus. but alas me indeed his thoughts had been so much taken up with the giant that he had never once looked at the pygmies nor even knew that there was such a funny little nation in the world. dead silent a mere mountain of clay forgive my tears nay i behold your own. such is the question. moreover if awakened and allowed to get upon his feet hercules might happen to do them a mischief before he could be beaten down again. accordingly all the fighting men of the nation took their weapons and went boldly up to hercules who still lay fast asleep little dreaming of the harm which the pygmies meant to do him. it was found necessary therefore to hit upon some other method of carrying on the war. he cried bewildered with sleep and staring about him as if he expected to see another giant. shouted all the pygmies at once. your body my little friend is about the size of an ordinary mans finger. goodbye. ha ha ha ho ho ho but this is a mistake. the dragons teeth. and bidding her go to sleep. and whence could this bull have come where are you all help help on looking at him more attentively she began to see that he was a beautiful animal and even fancied a particularly amiable expression in his face. never before did a bull have such bright and tender eyes and such smooth horns of ivory as this one. well my stars she cried. and how it would surprise her brothers to see her riding across the green meadow and indeed why not she said rather frightened at what she had done. the gentle and innocent creature for who could possibly doubt that he was so then what a scream of terror did the poor child send forth but it was too late. nothing more was ever seen of the white bull nothing more of the beautiful child. therefore when cadmus and his two brothers came crying home and told him how that a white bull had carried off their sister and swam with her over the sea the king was quite beside himself with grief and rage. although it was now twilight and fast growing dark he bade them set out instantly in search of her. cried the boys. the whole party therefore set forth together. in this manner they went down the palace steps and began a journey which turned out to be a great deal longer than they dreamed of. never never and they kept their word. they went on and on and traveled a long way and passed over mountains and rivers and sailed over seas. but certain it is that before they reached any place of rest their splendid garments were quite worn out. a snowwhite bull with a little princess on his back ho ho our sister is lost and never will be found. she probably perished in the sea or to whatever shore the white bull may have carried her it is now so many years ago that there would be neither love nor acquaintance between us should we meet again. there is no substance in the life which we are leading. were we to find her she would now be a woman grown and would look upon us all as strangers. mother without thy loving help and that of my son cadmus my limbs could not have borne me half so far as this. now take thy rest and be at peace. her weight was heavier upon his arm. the queen leaned heavily upon her sons arm and could walk only a few miles a day. at last they reached a solitary spot where she told her son that she must needs lie down and take a good long rest. she repeated looking cadmus tenderly in the face. you must not wait till it is finished. you must make a grave here and lay your mothers weary frame into it. cadmus burst into tears and for a long time refused to believe that his dear mother was now to be taken from him. it is enough. thou shalt wander no more on this hopeless search. he planted some flowers on his mothers grave and left them to grow there and make the place beautiful when he should be far away. he received various answers. some told him one thing and some another. his heart you will understand was now so heavy that it seemed impossible sometimes to carry it any farther. but his limbs were strong and active and well accustomed to exercise. seek her no more asked cadmus. for ever since he was a child you know it had been the great object of his life to find his sister. and now if he must give up the search he seemed to have no more business in the world. it said. these words were pronounced but a single time and died away into a whisper before cadmus was fully satisfied that he had caught the meaning. whenever he met anybody the old question was at his tongues end. cried cadmus. indeed it seemed as if there were something about the animal that bewitched people. said a second. cried a third. the secret of it was you must know that the cow was an enchanted cow and that without their being conscious of it she threw some of her enchantment over everybody that took so much as half a dozen steps behind her. they could not possibly help following her though all the time they fancied themselves doing it of their own accord. what a weary business it was the strangers grew very fond of cadmus and resolved never to leave him but to help him build a city wherever the cow might lie down. at no great distance they beheld a river gleaming in the sunshine. a home feeling stole into the heart of poor cadmus. the days and the years would pass over him and find him still in this pleasant spot. but cadmus was so enraged at the destruction of his friends that he cared neither for the size of the dragons jaws nor for his hundreds of sharp teeth. but do not you suppose that it made cadmus sorrowful to think of the melancholy fate which had befallen those poor friendly people who had followed the cow along with him it seemed as if he were doomed to lose everybody whom he loved or to see them perish in one way or another. cried he aloud. the next thing was to plant them. cadmus quite out of breath stood leaning upon his sword and wondering what was to happen next. every tooth of the dragon had produced one of these sons of deadly mischief. so enraged did they all look that cadmus fully expected them to put the whole world to the sword. of all the thousands that began the fight there were only five left standing. said he. they were almost giants indeed and had good need to be so else they never could have lived through so terrible a fight. said he. make yourselves useful what should it be but the most magnificent palace that had ever been seen in the world. at one time in the course of this weary voyage he arrived at an island that looked very green and pleasant but the name of which was unknown to him. at a distance towards the center of the island he beheld the stately towers of what seemed to be a palace built of snowwhite marble and rising in the midst of a grove of lofty trees. ulysses tried to catch the bird. asked ulysses. so he resolved for the present to return to the vessel and tell his companions what he had seen. this appeared to satisfy the bird. if these can be obtained all is well. said another. replied the bird very sorrowfully. the party accordingly went onward through the green and pleasant wood. cried the others. but before the strangers had time to look closely at this wonderful sight their attention was drawn off by a very sweet and agreeable sound. shall i never hear them again let us show ourselves at once. they were only less beautiful than the lady who seemed to be their mistress. do you smell the feast you see how it was with them. and once in a while the strangers seemed to taste something that they did not like. though i must needs say the wine has a queer taste too. dear me what little red eyes half buried in fat so he ran as fast as he could down the steps and never stopped to draw breath till he reached the shore. asked king ulysses as soon as he saw him. wait for me here until tomorrow. but king ulysses frowned sternly on them and shook his spear and bade them stop him at their peril. and using all the art it could to persuade him to go no farther. cried ulysses. is it because i too am a king that you desire so earnestly to speak with me but ulysses had no time to waste in trying to get at the mystery. in short i have said enough to make you guess that it was quicksilver and ulysses who knew him of old and had learned a great deal of his wisdom from him recognized him in a moment. asked quicksilver. inquired ulysses. while he was speaking quicksilver seemed to be in search of something he went stooping along the ground and soon laid his hand on a little plant with a snowwhite flower which he plucked and smelt of. ulysses had been looking at that very spot only just before and it appeared to him that the plant had burst into full flower the instant when quicksilver touched it with his fingers. keep it in your hand and smell of it frequently after you enter the palace and while you are talking with the enchantress. after listening attentively ulysses thanked his good friend and resumed his way. on entering the hall ulysses saw the magic fountain in the center of it. but ulysses did not waste much time in listening to the laughter or the song. cried she. the work had not yet gone any further. o no indeed. that good and amiable child he asked. then drinking off all the wine he looked the enchantress calmly in the face. spare me wisest of men. with a drawn sword hanging over her the enchantress would readily have consented to do as much good as she had hitherto done mischief however little she might like such employment. the comrades of ulysses however had not quite lost the remembrance of having formerly stood erect. and yet they did not seem to know what they wanted nor whether they were merely hungry or miserable from some other cause. they are hardly worth the trouble of changing them into the human form again. they cried. at this moment the note of a bird sounded from the branch of a neighboring tree. it was the purple bird who all this while had been sitting over their heads watching what was going forward and hoping that ulysses would remember how he had done his utmost to keep him and his followers out of harms way. so he let them howl as much as they liked but never troubled his head about them. mother ceres was exceedingly fond of her daughter proserpina and seldom let her go alone into the fields. the air today is a little too dry for our comfort. the young proserpina ran quickly to a spot where only the day before she had seen a great many flowers. but a little farther on what should she behold to tell you the truth foolish as it may seem she was half inclined to turn round and run away. thought she taking courage. but proserpina was so alarmed that she wished for nothing but to get out of his reach. and no wonder. as is always the case with children in trouble proserpinas first thought was to call for her mother. cried she all in a tremble. but her voice was too faint for her mother to hear. indeed it is most probable that ceres was then a thousand miles off making the corn grow in some far distant country. they immediately broke into so swift a gallop that it seemed rather like flying through the air than running along the earth. but mother ceres was a great way off and could not hear the cry. what you have been gathering flowers can you guess who i am they call my name pluto and i am the king of diamonds and all other precious stones. do you see this splendid crown upon my head cried proserpina. you never saw anything half so magnificent as my throne. the one thing which my palace needs is a merry little maid to run upstairs and down and cheer up the rooms with her smile. answered proserpina looking as miserable as she could. but she might just as well have talked to the wind that whistled past them for pluto urged on his horses and went faster than ever. proserpina continued to cry out and screamed so long and so loudly that her poor little voice was almost screamed away and when it was nothing but a whisper she happened to cast her eyes over a great broad field of waving grain and whom do you think she saw proserpina peeped at his face through the gathering dusk and hoped that he might not be so very wicked as she at first thought him. asked proserpina. when we pass those gates we are at home. but my stars what a strange dog it was on went the chariot and king pluto seemed greatly pleased to find himself once more in his own kingdom. that dear dear mother he alighted from the chariot and taking proserpina in his arms carried her up a lofty flight of steps into the great hall of the palace. and yet there was a kind of gloom in the midst of this enchanted light nor was there a single object in the hall that was really agreeable to behold except the little proserpina herself a lovely child with one earthly flower which she had not let fall from her hand. you recollect too the loud scream which proserpina gave just when the chariot was out of sight. cried ceres. proserpina has been at play with us it is true but she left us a long while ago meaning only to run a little way upon the dry land and gather some flowers for a wreath. ceres scarcely waited to hear what the nymphs had to say before she hurried off to make inquiries all through the neighborhood. the stupid people the earth did not produce it by any help of mine nor of its own accord. but nobody had seen proserpina nor could give mother ceres the least hint which way to seek her. but neither could pan tell her what had become of proserpina any better than the rest of these wild people. and thus mother ceres went wandering about for nine long days and nights finding no trace of proserpina unless it were now and then a withered flower and these she picked up and put in her bosom because she fancied that they might have fallen from her poor childs hand. in so doing she caught a glimpse of what seemed to be a woman sitting on the brown leaves of the last autumn a great heap of which had been swept into the cave by the wind. but mother ceres the moment she saw her knew that this was an odd kind of a person who put all her enjoyment in being miserable and never would have a word to say to other people unless they were as melancholy and wretched as she herself delighted to be. in all the world since her daughters loss she had found no other companion. something terrible has happened to the child you may rest assured. i can tell you nothing more except that in my honest opinion you will never see your daughter again. why did not i think of him before o pray do not think of going near him. a very lovely child indeed. i am happy to tell you my dear madam that i did see the little proserpina not many days ago. you may make yourself perfectly easy about her. i must have her back again. besides i am not upon the best of terms with king pluto. her case on the contrary looked more desperate than ever. poor mother ceres then indeed she would stand and gaze at them with tears in her eyes. asked ceres. their wonder was the greater because he was never seen to taste any food not even so much as a cup of milk. one night therefore she hid herself in the chamber where ceres and the little prince were accustomed to sleep. to the queens astonishment and joy she could perceive no token of the childs being injured by the hot fire in which he had lain. she now turned to mother ceres and asked her to explain the mystery. you little know the mischief you have done him. but you have ruined your own son. for though he will be a strong man and a hero in his day yet on account of your folly he will grow old and finally die like the sons of other women. poor baby he never slept so warmly again. but now having nothing else to busy herself about she became just as wretched as before. the old people shook their white heads and said that the earth had grown aged like themselves and was no longer capable of wearing the warm smile of summer on its face. and while they settle their business together we must inquire what proserpina had been doing ever since we saw her last. the immense palace had a thousand rooms and was full of beautiful and wonderful objects. the inhabitants all felt this and king pluto more than any of them. and the best thing you can now do is to let me go again. then i might remember you sometimes and think that you were as kind as you knew how to be. you are too fond of living in the broad daylight and gathering flowers. what an idle and childish taste that is and then she burst into tears. king pluto gazed after her and wished that he too was a child. she ran back to him and for the first time in all her life put her small soft hand in his. are you not terribly hungry but he might just as well save himself the trouble poor fat little man that he is. but there was no choice of such things in king plutos palace. dear me before proserpina knew what she was about her teeth had actually bitten it of their own accord. as for honest pluto he never guessed at the secret. i give you your liberty. go with quicksilver. thought she. and proserpina came running and flung herself upon her mothers bosom. when their hearts had grown a little more quiet mother ceres looked anxiously at proserpina. until this very morning not a morsel of food had passed my lips. the instant i tasted it king pluto and quicksilver came into the room. exclaimed ceres. you are but half restored to your mother. he certainly did very wrong to carry me off but then as he says it was but a dismal sort of life for him to live in that great gloomy place all alone and it has made a wonderful change in his spirits to have a little girl to run up stairs and down. the golden fleece. he lived in a cavern and had the body and legs of a white horse with the head and shoulders of a man. i wonder what the blacksmith charged him for a set of iron shoes jason looked round greatly surprised for he did not know that anybody was near. she now asked. she seemed to know his name you will observe and indeed those great brown eyes looked as if they had a knowledge of everything whether past or to come. just take me on your back theres a good youth and carry me across the river. and jason unless you will help an old woman at her need you ought not to be a king. but do as you please. it rushed past however without touching him. asked the old woman. there was no time just then to inquire what the speaking oak had said. there is your path. go along my good jason and my blessing go with you. on the outside of the town there was an immense crowd of people not only men and women but children too all in their best clothes and evidently enjoying a holiday. he inquired of one of the multitude what town it was near by and why so many persons were here assembled together. said the man to his next neighbor. besides he could hear them whispering to one another. they kept saying. here he is at last whence has he come what does he mean to do when jason said this the king gave a quick startled glance down at his feet. and he clutched more closely the great knife in his hand as if he were half a mind to slay jason instead of the black bull. in the whole course of the kings reign he had never been thrown into such a fright and agitation as by the spectacle of poor jasons bare foot. pray what may i call your name in the first place it would be necessary to make a long voyage through unknown seas. cried he. this wonderful tree stood in the center of an ancient wood. at first there was a deep silence not only within the shadow of the talking oak but all through the solitary wood. the sound grew louder and became like the roar of a high wind. he visited it again therefore and standing beside its huge rough trunk inquired what he should do next. cut me off the right arm was extended as if pointing onward. jason had been looking straight into the face of the image when these words were spoken. but he could hardly believe either his ears or his eyes. it would have been very odd indeed if it had not. there was a fair prospect that they would meet with plenty of such adventures before finding the golden fleece. she had grown up in a very wild way and talked much about the rights of women and loved hunting and war far better than her needle. to confess the truth few people believed him when he said it. well at the first ringing note of the music they felt the vessel stir. in order to make the time pass away more pleasantly during the voyage the heroes talked about the golden fleece. there was no lack of wonderful events as you may judge from what you have already heard. ah brave jason turn back before it is too late. cried his nine and forty brave comrades. while the king talked with jason a beautiful young woman was standing behind the throne. i know a great deal of which other young princesses are ignorant and can do many things which they would be afraid so much as to dream of. gazing at medea he beheld a wonderful intelligence in her face. if jason had been capable of fearing anything he would have been afraid of making this young princess his enemy for beautiful as she now looked she might the very next instant become as terrible as the dragon that kept watch over the golden fleece. but how can you help me to do the things of which you speak i am an enchantress. i am acquainted with some of your secrets you perceive. what it is i leave you to find out in the moment of peril. the young man assured her that his heart would not fail him. at the appointed hour he met the beautiful medea on the marble steps of the kings palace. she gave him a basket in which were the dragons teeth just as they had been pulled out of the monsters jaws by cadmus long ago. after entering the pasture the princess paused and looked around. it will be excellent sport i assure you when they catch a glimpse of your figure. he therefore let go medeas hand and walked boldly forward in the direction whither she had pointed. well he must have been wonderfully strong in his arms to be sure. he inquired of medea who was now standing by his side. wherever a dragons tooth had fallen there stood a man armed for battle. lead us to the charge cried she. each of the three who had been struck by the stone took it for granted that his next neighbor had given him a blow and instead of running any farther towards jason they began to fight among themselves. victory come jason left the kings presence in great sorrow and anger. her black eyes shone upon him with such a keen intelligence that he felt as if there were a serpent peeping out of them and although she had done him so much service only the night before he was by no means very certain that she would not do him an equally great mischief before sunset. inquired medea slightly smiling. but be of good courage. how they contrived to keep themselves alive is more than i can imagine. it proceeded from an object which appeared to be suspended at about a mans height from the ground a little farther within the wood. asked jason. jason went onward a few steps farther and then stopped to gaze. jason answered only by drawing his sword and making a step forward. quick with one bound he leaped aboard. said the angel. said the child. said the angel. said the child but he went out into the garden and waited. asked the child. the squirrel looked him over carefully. he said. asked the child. by and by a large tommy cat came along. asked the child. i have been washing myself in the sun all the morning while it is clear that no water has come near you for a long time. he walked on waving his tail and the child waited. the child did not wish to ask the pig if he were his brother but the pig did not wait to be asked. said the child. said the pig. said the child. said the pig brother. come along i say said the child and he began to cry. cried the child and he clung to the angels dress. he said. and he trotted on. then the boy would go up to the top of a hill and look across at another hill that rose some miles away. on this far hill stood a house with windows of clear gold and diamonds. the boy thanked his father and kissed his mother then he put a piece of bread in his pocket and started off to find the house with the golden windows. it was pleasant walking. his shadow too kept beside him and would dance or run with him as he pleased so it was very cheerful. then he scattered the crumbs for the birds as his mother had taught him to do and went on his way. he came up to the house and then he could well have wept for the windows were of clear glass like any others and there was no gold anywhere about them. a woman came to the door and looked kindly at the boy and asked him what he wanted. the woman shook her head and laughed. she bade the boy sit down on the broad stone step at the door and brought him a cup of milk and a cake and bade him rest then she called her daughter a child of his own age and nodded kindly at the two and went back to her work. then when they had eaten an apple together and so had become friends the boy asked her about the golden windows. the little girl nodded and said she knew all about them only he had mistaken the house. she said. said the boy. and when they looked again the boy saw that it was his own home. he kissed her and promised to come again but he did not tell her what he had learned and so he went back down the hill and the little girl stood in the sunset light and watched him. asked his mother. yes the boy had had a very good day. asked his father. said the boy. the children stopped their play and looked at one another. they said. yes said the man. the children brought him in gladly and set him on the seat that they had made out of an old cask. they had covered it with the old red cloak to make it look like a throne and it made a very good one. they said. said the man. said another. said the man. said the man. the children stood by the wall and watched the man as he went slowly along. said one of the children. said another. swing song 
    as i swing as i swing     here beneath my mothers wing     here beneath my mothers arm     never earthly thing can harm. up and down to and fro     with a steady sweep i go     like a swallow on the wing     as i swing as i swing. go away you velvet thing i must swing i must swing little child come work with me. learn to make a perfect nest     that of all things is the best. come as i swing as i swing     though i have not any wing     still i would not change with you     happiest bird that ever flew. the great feast 
once the play angel came into a nursery where four little children sat on the floor with sad and troubled faces. asked the play angel. said the child whose nursery it was. said the play angel. said the child whose nursery it was. said the child who was a cousin and therefore felt a right to speak. said the child whose nursery it was. she said. the play angel gave a piece to the next child. said the child. look at it said the third child. then the angel gave the last piece to the child whose nursery it was. she said. but inside i think you will find him pink. so the children ate the feast all up. said the angel. said all the four children together. said the child whose nursery it was. said the angel. the child hung his head. he said. then all the other children cried out together. look said the angel. said the child. said the mother. said the child. said the mother. said the mother. as she moved in her seat she flashed with jewels and gold but her eyes were brighter than her diamonds. asked the child running up beside the chariot. said the child. said the mother. the child danced on again leaping and running from side to side of the road and the mother followed as best she might. cried the child. the maiden blushed more sweetly than before. she cried. said the child. the maiden took him up in her arms and kissed him and held him tenderly. she said. but suddenly her face changed. she cried. now if the maiden had only known he thought her twice as lovely with the child in her arms but she did not know. said the mother. said the child. said the mother. suddenly he looked up in her face. said the mother. and she went on singing and stepped out so bravely on her lame foot that no one would ever have known she was lame. the boy did that and all went well and the mother sang at her work. so the boy waited and all went as before and the mother sang at her work. then the boy started forward and as he started the string of the apron broke. cried the boy and he ran out into the world with the broken string hanging beside him. the mother gathered up the other end of the string and put it in her bosom and went about her work again but she sang no more. the boy ran on and on rejoicing in his freedom and in the fresh air and the morning sun. he found the little one sitting on the ground with the sun at its back for the day was young looking at its own shadow which lay on the ground before it and weeping bitterly. asked the angel. said the child. asked the angel. i cannot see them i see only the shadow. the angel lifted the child and set it on its feet with its face to the early sun. said the angel. the child brushed away the tears from its eyes and looked. said the little one. cried the child. asked the sailor man. when he was gone the first child ran to the window and looked out. she is dancing like a lady at a ball i never saw such a beauty. just then the sailor man came in. asked the sailor man. said the nurse. by and by his mother came into the room and saw him. asked the second child. so the second child climbed upon the log. said the first child. look the water is so clear that we can see the fishes swimming about blue and red and green. look oh presently the second child got down from the log. and he walked slowly away. the first child looked after him a moment. and he won the heart of a pretty mermaid       who lived in the deep blue sea. i never saw any one half       so perfectly sweet as you oh ill willingly go with you. a fortune 
one day a man was walking along the street and he was sad at heart. business was dull he had set his desire upon a horse that cost a thousand dollars and he had only eight hundred to buy it with. there were other things to be sure that might be bought with eight hundred dollars but he did not want those so he was sorrowful and thought the world a bad place. the child held out its closed hand. said the man. the child nodded and drew nearer then opened its hand. it said and the street rang with its happy laughter. the man looked and in the childs hand lay a penny. said the child. said the man. asked the little boy. said the man. said the little boy. said the man. and he saw that the world was a good place after all. oh father why is it dark why is there such a terrible thing as darkness the father took the child in his arms and carried it downstairs and out into the summer night. he said in his strong kind voice. and oh what these thoughts were i am going to tell you. do just come and look at them golden golden golden i believe i could get some perfectly well. of course it would oh joy oh how small they were and how long it took even to cover the bottom of the basket. that would do for one day she thought and now for the grand experiment oh dont give up the ship yet. i should not be at all surprised if you found some after all. if any one had been standing near just at that moment i think it is possible that he might have seen the old gentlemans hand go into his pocket and out again very quickly and might have heard a little splash in the kettle but nobody was near so of course i cannot say anything about it. oh wonder and delight in it lay three great broad shining pieces of gold she stared and stared and when the old gentleman put the gold into her hand she still stood as if in a happy dream gazing at it. knitting was out of the question. oh very very very well oh my mother dear what do you think i have got in my hand what do you think at last she stopped and holding out her hand opened it and showed her mother what was in it. mrs.
gray was really frightened. and its all for you every bit of it and then she told her mother the whole story. the tears came into mrs.
grays eyes but they were tears of joy and gratitude. may heaven bless him and reward him for she was a patient cat and the summer was before her. she waited a week and then she climbed up again to the top of the tree and peeped into the nest. there lay two lovely blue eggs smooth and shining. when another week had passed she climbed the tree again and peeped into the nest. this time there were five eggs. so she waited a little longer and then went up again to look. ah she said. but when she looked again at the young birds to see which one she should take first she saw that they were very thin oh very very thin they were thin birds may be good but fat birds are much better. they will soon be as fat as i wish them to be. i will not wait another day. and when she reached the top and looked into the nest it was empty and it is for alices supper ho and it is for alices supper he ha ha oh these were not pleasant words. so he fell upon the frogs and they fled before him. and one jumped into the water and one jumped on the land and another jumped into the reeds for such is their manner. and taking the fish he swam with speed to the shore. and he ate the fish and departed joyful. said the little boy. said the father. that is the way they do things where the little boy lives. would you like to live there he asked. said the child. said the child. and this is not all we can do over again the things that we tried to do last year and perhaps failed in doing. we have another chance to be good and kind to do little loving things that help and to cure ourselves of doing naughty things. our hearts can have lovely new seasons like the flowers and trees and all the sweet things that grow and bear leaves and fruit. are you glad i came if you are glad say happy new year each in his own way i say it to you all now in my way. happy new year when the child turned to leave the wood the joyful chorus followed her and she went smiling home and told her mother all about it. said the pan. said the cake. said the pan. the cake went on his way and soon he passed by a cottage door where sat a woman spinning and her ten children playing about her. and she put out her hand to take him. said the cake. said the woman. and put out his hand to take it. said the cake. said the child. cried the cake. consider my size and yours said the child. and he fixed greedy eyes on the cake and stretched forth his hand again. cried the cake. said the pan. oh dear oh dear he said it till everybody was tired of hearing it. any more. i dont know anything else to say. oh dear oh dear one day his mother could not bear it any longer and she sent for his fairy godmother and told her all about it. said the fairy godmother. for he was rather afraid of her. said the godmother sharply and she put on her spectacles and looked at him. he said. said the fairy godmother. said the fairy. observed the fairy. it is still some hours before noon so i advise you to be careful. said the fairy godmother with a nod. goodby. and away she flew out of the window. i wont have it oh dear oh dear oh dear oh dear he was silent for some time and when his mother called him to his lessons he tried very hard not to say the dangerous words. he was afraid to open his lips for whenever he did the words would slip out in spite of him. repeated his father. oh dear oh dear ive done it again oh dear oh dear oh dear said his father looking much surprised. he sat amazed but was roused by his mothers calling him to breakfast. he saw plainly enough now what his punishment was to be and the thought of it made him tremble. he went out into the garden and there he met john the gardener carrying a basket of rosy apples. oh how good they looked was all the poor boy could say though he wanted an apple oh so much i will not give the whole history of that miserable day a miserable day it was from beginning to end. he knew well enough by this time but he could not tell his father so. he went to his room and sat looking out of the window a hungry and miserable boy. in the afternoon his cousin will came up to see him. he cried. asked will. never mind. ill give you half of mine if you like. i suppose you expected me to give you all of them did you goodby and he didnt. this was the one of the kings officers who had been most eager in searching for the thief. cried the king waking with a start. so the king put the coal on the table and himself into the bed and was soon sound asleep. black and red yet a third time i shall do it and this time you shall learn the name of the thief. said the coal. now listen and follow my directions closely. a good part of me will be rubbed off but there will be enough left to put in your crown. you may then go hunting or riding but not for more than an hour and when you return you must instantly call all your court together as if on business of the greatest importance. in this way he opened and closed the door many times. the astonished courtiers one and all lifted their hands high in air. the king looked and behold the flowers may sleep but the winds must wake     early and late for the flowers sake. the children may sleep but the winds must wake     early and late for the childrens sake. singing so sweet in each little ones ear     he thinks his mothers own song to hear. the three remarks 
there was once a princess the most beautiful princess that ever was seen. she was also wise graceful and gentle so that one would have thought she must be the happiest princess in the world. but alas she could make only three remarks. you may well imagine what a great misfortune this was to a young and lively princess. but this the princess could not endure for she had never yet seen a man whom she was willing to marry. nevertheless she feared her fathers anger for she knew that he always kept his word so that very night she slipped down the back stairs of the palace opened the back door and ran away out into the wide world. said everybody. after several days she came to a deep forest which she entered without hesitation for she knew no fear. he gasped. the enemy is without doubt close at hand and all is over. if this gracious lady will consent to go forward instead of returning through the wood we may yet escape with our lives. sweet princess now do i know that thou art the love for whom i have waited so long and whom i have sought through so many lands. asked his father. feeling hungry he went into a bakers shop intending to buy a loaf of bread for his supper. there was a great noise and confusion in the back part of the shop and on going to see what was the matter he found the baker on his knees beside a large box or chest which he was trying with might and main to keep shut. but there was something inside the box which was trying just as hard to get out and it screamed and kicked and pushed the lid up as often as the baker shut it down. but today she has broken the lock of the box and i know not how to keep her down. whom have you there cried the wife in terror. the sweetmeats that i make are so good that their fame has spread far and wide and the rat king hearing of them has taken up his abode in my cellar. every night he comes up and eats all the sweetmeats i have made the day before. go away and hide yourself for a few minutes and all will be well. come and see the way is free     hear my signal one two three and he scratched three times on the floor. almost immediately the head of a rat popped up through the hole. replied the man. bring me a red cotton umbrella and all will yet be well. but what does the mighty dragon want for example the dragon sat on a silver throne with a golden knife in one hand and a golden fork in the other. i must serve you myself most mighty dragon else you shall not taste of my food. therefore put down your knife and fork and open your mouth and you shall see what you shall see. i have eaten much bread though never before in a round loaf. have you anything more or shall the man take away your jacket nevertheless it is not new for i have tasted the same kind of thing before only not nearly so good. said the dragon for the ball had stuck fast being too big for him to swallow. the youth picked it up and put it on his own head and then called the people about him and addressed them. your dragon have i slain and now i am your king and if you will always do exactly what i tell you to do you will have no further trouble. and they always did exactly as he told them and had no further trouble. said the child. oh dear oh dear said the child. said the angel. said the child. said the angel. said the child. said the angel and he took the child by her shoulders and set her down. said the child. said the child. said the angel. but i stayed to hear no more for my boat had reached the shore     so very very early in the morning. said the man. said the angel. said the angel. he put out a strong white hand and taking the man by the collar tumbled him neck and crop into the ditch. do you see what you have done the burning house 
some neighbours were walking together in the cool of the day watching the fall of the twilight and talking of this and that and as they walked they saw at a little distance a light as it were a house on fire. while they were talking the house burned up. he was too old to go out so he enjoyed himself at home in a quiet way. that is what i am determined to find out. i cannot understand your going on travelling and travelling and never finding out why you do it. replied no. these are your orders. ah here was something worth living for. ah what a glorious prospect how swiftly he moved how well his tail looked even though it was still rather short what a fine fellow he was altogether and the sun how i should like to know a little more about the sun it shows how i have been enjoying myself that i have forgotten it so long but now i must certainly make a point of finding out. so he turned out to the left and waited till no. he said as soon as the other was within speaking distance. replied no. what good does it do why do we travel for weeks and months and years said the elder still more shortly. he cried. called a clear merry voice just behind him. shall we travel together said no. what have i done tell me that will you come along i say as they went no. come on he would be punished in any case and he might as well get all the pleasure he could. when the sun saw them coming he smiled and seemed much pleased. cried no. and now ah me now the sun opened his huge fiery mouth. and i believe it was. day dreams 
    white wings over the water     fluttering fluttering over the sea     white wings over the water     what are you bringing to me looking away to sea. when you had passed into his back garden you would never have fancied yourself in france. the great sight of his place however was the heros private den at the bottom of the garden. was the warning on one of the cards. greeted you from another. my word it required some pluck to move about in the den of the great tartarin. each man as he left in the morning took with him a brand new cap and when they got well into the country and were ready for sport they took their caps off threw then high in the air and shot at them as they fell. theres no mistake he was a wonder there were really two men inside the skin of tartarin. an axe not another word did tartarin utter that day. when asked if this were true his pride would not let him deny it and he pretended that it might be true. but he had let himself in for this and felt he would have to see it through. he showed no haste to be off. ii. about ten oclock the bold hero issued forth. he had slept all the evening through the night and morning and well into the next afternoon a moment later he determined to be up. he jumped on the floor and began his preparations. to his excited imagination it seemed a likely place for a lion so dropping on one knee and laying one of his guns in front of him he waited. he waited very patiently. one hour two hours but nothing stirred. but hush what was that clearly his shot had told the wounded lion had made off. he would now wait for the female to appear as he had read in books. but two or more hours passed and she did not come and the ground was damp and the night air cold so the hunter thought he would camp for the night. finally he threw it on the ground in a rage and lay on the top of it. surely i have been dreaming. there is such a difference between a lion and an ass and the poor little creature looked so innocent. she came in the form of an old french woman with a large red umbrella and it would have been better for tartarin to have faced a female lion. clearly the lions were to be looked for further south. think of it iii. his blood was up at the very idea. he was afraid he might disgrace france. he would meet the king of beasts alone it must have been two hours before he was sure that the beast was moving quite near him in the dry bed of a river. the prince had waited a whole month for such a chance but even as he wept the bushes were pushed aside a little in front of him and a huge lion presented itself. all was over in a moment for he had nearly blown the king of beasts to pieces iv. off went the train. but it had not gone far when everybody was looking out of the windows and laughing. behind the train ran the camel holding his own too the people are waving their caps in the air it is no joke they are serious. now all this was the result of sending home the skin of the blind lion. even this tartarin turned to good account. harry who happened to be near ran up and seizing the snake by the neck tore it from tommys leg and threw it to a great distance. this is my bed and that is harrys. tommy took it and thanked harry but without turning his eyes from the ground. at this tommy cried more bitterly than before. it seemed to him the most delicious fruit that he had ever tasted. ii. so when harry returned tommy took an early opportunity of asking him how he came to be able to read. asked tommy. that is no more than all the people round here continually do. iii. tommy as i am now a great deal sir for then i always had something or another the matter with me. should you harry like to go to live in some town harry indeed sir i should not for then i must leave everything i love in the world. tommy and have you ever been in any large town i went home the next day and never was better pleased in my life. when i came to the top of the great hill from which you have a prospect of our house i really thought i should have cried with joy. the fields looked all so pleasant and the very cattle when i went about to see them all seemed glad that i was come home again. but as to the fine young ladies you talk of the truth is that they neither love nor would be contented in any place. it is no wonder they dislike the country where they find neither employment nor amusement. iv. one morning the young gentlemen agreed to take a walk in the country. harry went with them. harry said he did not wish to tell but if he added he were asked he would have to tell the truth. a quarrel followed in which tommy struck his friend in the face with his fist. and so on. my mind was filled with thoughts of seeing the world and nothing could persuade me to give up my desire. our troubles were not yet over however for a few days later the wind increased till it blew a terrible storm indeed. my horror of mind put me into such a condition that i can by no words describe it. we fired guns for help and a ship who had rid it out just ahead of us ventured a boat out. i embraced the offer and went the voyage with him. it was a prosperous voyage. i was fortunate enough to fall into the hands of a master who treated me with no little kindness. one day he sent me out with a moor to catch fish for him. instead of that however i stepped forward and stooping behind the moor took him by surprise and tossed him overboard. he rose to the surface and called on me to take him in. for reply i presented a gun at him and told him if he came nearer the boat i would shoot him and that as the sea was calm he might easily swim ashore. so he turned about and swam for the shore and i make no doubt but he reached it with ease. on coming nearer they hailed me but i understood not a word. they then bade me come on board and very kindly took me in with all my goods. ii. we were all thrown into the sea and out of fifteen who were on board none escaped but myself. night coming on me i took up my lodging in a tree. i swam out to the ship and found that her stern lay lifted up on the bank. my next work was to view the country. i must not forget that i brought on shore two cats and a dog. he was a trusty servant to me many years. i wanted nothing that he could fetch me nor any company. i only wanted him to talk to me but that he could not do. later i managed to catch a parrot which did much to cheer my loneliness. i now went in search of a place where to fix my dwelling. on the side of this rock was a hollow space like the entrance of a cave before which i resolved to pitch my tent. the entrance i made to be by a short ladder to go over the top and when i was in i lifted the ladder after me. when i had done this i began to work my way into the rock. all the earth and stones i dug out i laid up within my fence and thus i made me a cave just behind my tent which served me like a cellar. i knew not how it came there. at last it occurred to me that i had shaken out the bag there. i kept all this for seed and bore the want of bread with patience. i soon found that i needed many things to make me comfortable. first i wanted a chair and a table for without them i must live like a savage. so i set to work. from the trunk of the tree i cut a log of the length my board was to be. on these i laid my tools and other things. from time to time i made many useful things. i had however one want greater than all the others bread. but for an oven i was indeed in great pain. at length i found out an experiment for that also. it need not be wondered at if all these things took up most of the third year of my abode in the island. i had now brought my state of life to be much easier than it was at first and i learned to look more upon the bright side of my condition and less on the dark. had anyone in england met such a man as i was it must have frightened them or raised great laughter. there was my majesty prince and lord of the whole island. my old dog sat at my right hand and two cats on each side of the table expecting a bit from my hand as a mark of special favour. iii. one day walking along the beach i was exceedingly surprised with the print of a mans naked foot plainly impressed on the sand. i listened i looked around but i could hear nothing nor see anything. i went up to a rising ground to look further i walked backwards and forwards on the shore but i could see only that one impression. i went to it again. there was exactly a foot toes heel and every part of a foot. i found it much larger this filled me again with all manner of fears and when i went home i began to prepare against an attack. the poor savage who fled was so frightened with the noise of my piece that he seemed inclined still to fly. i took him up and made much of him and comforted him. in a little time i began to speak to him and teach him to speak to me and first i let him know his name should be friday which was the day i saved his life. i began now to have some use for my tongue again and besides the pleasure of talking to friday i had a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself. iv. o sorrow said i. i comforted him and told him i was in as much danger as he. it was a good while before i could make him tell me what was the matter but when he came a little to himself he told me it was his father. they started up at the noise and i perceived them about to fly from me when i spoke to them in english. it now occurred to me that the time of my deliverance was come and that it would be easy to bring these fellows in to be hearty in getting possession of the ship. they seemed thankful for this and said they would much rather venture to stay than be carried to england to be hanged. i left the next day and went on board the ship with friday. and so while the girl went she carries me quite away. who my father and mother really were i have never learnt. and i was exactly fitted for their society. the captain who was made desperate by his danger tried us all and we were all condemned to die. i do not remember any great concern i was under about it only that i cried very much for i knew little then of this world and nothing at all of the next. nor did we suffer any harm from them during our whole stay on the island. ii. i only wished we could see one and come at her. we were a little fleet of three ships and an army of between twenty and thirty as dangerous fellows as ever lived. we were bound somewhere and nowhere for though we knew what we intended to do we really did not know what we were doing. we parted at the gold coast from our black companions on the best of terms. iii. i told him yes with all my heart for i did not care where i went having nothing to lose and no one to leave behind me. in short william was a most agreeable companion but he had the better of us in this part that if we were taken we were sure to be hanged and he was sure to escape. iv. at this he was startled a little and returned. for william had a sister whom he was anxious to see once more. so we came to england and some time later i married williams sister with whom i am much more happy than i deserve. what barnaby said the blacksmith. said the old man. hark she cried. he carries other lives besides his own. dont ask what it means. he is not to be followed or stopped the old man looked at her in wonder and let her draw him into the house. thats sleep eh i dreamed just now that something it was in the shape of a man followed me and wouldnt let me be. it came creeping on to worry me nearer and nearer. cried a hoarse voice. keep up your spirits the bird went on in a hoarse voice. and then he began to whistle. he listening and hiding here. barnaby first upon the spot last night. he returned. said barnaby. thats a brave crowd he talks of. cried his mother. he answered. heres a brave crowd come or wait till i come back we know nothing of these matters. he added addressing barnaby. you wear the colour do you fall in barnaby. rang out. growled mr. dennis with a strong oath and in tones of deep disgust. and well get money for her. thats all weve got to do. hes worth a dozen men in earnest as youd find if you tried a fall with him. some called to him to fly when the pole swept the air above the peoples heads and the mans saddle was empty in an instant. iii. but barnaby bold barnaby had been taken. then he sprang towards him put his arms about his neck and pressed his head against his cheek. he never learnt that his father supposed to have been murdered was himself a murderer. this was the widows dreadful secret. he had never loved his life so well as then but nothing could move him. remember the prisoners furniture from the prison lodge was piled up in a monstrous heap and set blazing oil was poured on and at last the great gate yielded to the flames. there was no need of it now for inside and out the prison was soon in flames. barnaby and his father were quickly released and passed from hand to hand into the street. iv. said barnaby. dont you cry for me. he was to die. there was no hope. they had tried to save him. but the well was not one of mercy and barnaby was to die. from the first his mother had never left him save at night and with her beside him he was contented. nobody comes near us. dont you think theres a good chance yet dont you the clock struck. barnaby looked in his mothers face and saw that the time had come. a man can die but once. the time wore on. five oclock had struck six seven and eight. im quite happy. look at me am i afraid to die you were not to blame. you have always been very good to me. no man alive knows what it means. it has passed into a joke. it has been death to many but it is a joke in the profession. what did i say to this he was not altered but he was surprised to see how altered i was and appeared quite pleased. she came to meet me with a smile of welcome and her hand extended but seemed to change her mind in a moment and kissed me. our all three coming together for the first time in such an unusual place was a thing to talk about and we talked about it. richard bowed and stepped forward. very happy i am sure to have the honour. whispered richard not thinking she could hear him. i was not mad at that time. i had youth and hope i believe beauty. it matters very little now. neither of the three served or saved me. i expect a judgment. on the day of judgment. shortly. on the day of judgment. we left her at the bottom of the stairs. and hope. and beauty. inside was an old man in spectacles and a hair cap and entering the shop the little old lady presented him to us. ii. a word in earnest is as good as a speech. i am heartily glad to see you. you are at home. while he spoke i glanced at his face. so this was our coming to bleak house. he said. i shook my head. it was about a will when it was about anything. and we cant get out of the suit on any terms for we are made parties to it and must be parties to it whether we like it or not. but it wont do to think of it on the day of judgment. always the same number. one for every day in the week. iii. i had thought sometimes that if he had done so i should have been glad. i read the letter. but i read it through three times before i laid it down. it asked me would i be the mistress of bleak house. i thought he might speak to me about the letter but he never did. i put my two arms around his neck and kissed him and he said was this the mistress of bleak house the second you know what. knowing i had done no good by coming down i prepared to return to london on the morrow. i met him in the hotel where i was staying and he seemed quite pleased to see me. iv. then he took a few turns up and down and sank upon the sofa. never any more. i am going to stay with my dear husband. we have been married above two months. but i had to tell him that i could never forget how proud and glad i was at having been beloved by him. he took my hand and kissed it and was like himself again. my guardian said gaily. at the end of the month my guardian went away to yorkshire and asked me to follow him. it was a beautiful summer morning when we went out to look at the house and there over the porch was written. hear me my love but do not speak. one more last word. he was to come and tell me all that passed and he did. i have no more to say. this is bleak house. he rose and raised me with him. we were no longer alone. my husband i have called him by that name full seven happy years now stood at my side. he kissed me once again. i know that my mistake has caused you some distress. we all three went home together next day. we asked a gentleman by us if he knew what case was on. over for the day richard was lying on the sofa with his eyes closed when i went in. when he opened them i fully saw for the first time how worn he was. but he spoke cheerfully and said how glad he was to think of our intended marriage. in the evening my guardian came in and laid his hand softly on richards. and burst into tears. my guardian sat down beside him keeping his hand on richards. we can see now. he sought to raise himself a little. i have married you to poverty and trouble i have scattered your means to the winds. a smile lit up his face as she bent to kiss him. not this oh not this my fathers eyes had been closed upon the light of this world six months when mine opened upon it. i remember a few years later a gentleman with beautiful black hair and whiskers walking home from church on sunday with us and somehow i didnt like him or his deep voice and i was jealous that his hand should touch my mothers in touching me which it did. cried my mother. they were sitting by the fire in the best parlour when i came in. i gave him my hand. i could not look at her i could not look at him i knew quite well he was looking at us both. as soon as i could creep away i crept upstairs and cried myself to sleep. i soon fell into disgrace over my lessons. at the first stroke i caught the hand with which he held me in my mouth between my teeth and bit it through. he beat me then as if he would have beaten me to death. and when he had gone i was kept a close prisoner in my room and was not allowed to see my mother and was only permitted to walk in the garden for half an hour every day. i saw my mother before i left. they had persuaded her i was a wicked fellow and she was more sorry for that than for my going. ii. so will your washing and your clothes will be looked after for you too. there were three or four boys counting me. my own mind was now made up. iii. fortunately it was summer weather for i was obliged to part with coat and waistcoat to buy food. my hair had known no comb or brush since i left london. said my aunt and sat flat down in the garden path. i have been very unhappy since my mother died. i have been taught nothing and put to work not fit for me. the first thing my aunt did was to pour the contents of several bottles down my throat. said my aunt. thus i began my new life in a new name and with everything new about me. my aunt was as happy as i was in this arrangement. never be mean in anything never be false never be cruel. iv. i said after looking at him for some time. i asked. how much have i to be thankful for in living with mr. how much i have to be thankful for in that that little fellow seems to be no part of me i remember him as something left behind upon the road of life and almost think of him as of someone else. gone also. the years pass. i have come out in another way. my record is nearly finished. let me look back once more for the last time before i close these leaves. i have advanced in fame and fortune. i have been married ten years and i see my children playing in the room. one face is above all these and beyond them all. the earth was made for dombey and son to trade in and the sun and moon were made to give them light. of those years he had been married ten married as some said to a lady with no heart to give him. but such idle talk never reached the ears of mr. dombey. but what was that girl to dombey and son still no answer. cried the child sobbing aloud. but now he was ill at ease about her. he saw nothing of this. ii. he was not fond of her he was not afraid of her. once she asked him when they were alone what he was thinking about. asked paul. said paul. nobody can go and whisper secrets to a mad bull. as paul had not considered the subject in that light he allowed himself to be put down for the present. she told him that it was only the noise of the rolling waves. always the same thing. he rose up looking eagerly at the horizon. she told him that there was another country opposite but he said he didnt mean that he meant farther away farther away iii. the doctor was sitting in his study when mr. dombey and paul arrived. he said to mr. dombey. over and over again. which paul of course would immediately do. the time arrived for taking leave. iv. he would sometimes ask her. and he could not forget it now. he liked him for it. he was not afraid. paul looked it in the face and thought was that his father the next time he observed the figure at the bottom of the bed he called to it. that was the beginning of his always saying in the morning that he was a great deal better and that they were to tell his father so. how many times the golden water danced upon the wall how many nights the dark dark river rolled towards the sea paul never counted never sought to know. one night he had been thinking of his mother and her picture in the drawingroom downstairs. paul fell asleep and when he awoke the sun was high. but its very near the sea. i hear the waves. and now there was a shore before him. who stood on the bank he put his hands together as he had been used to do at his prayers. he did not remove his arms to do it but they saw him fold them so behind her neck. i know her by the face the old old fashion the old old fashion death he was fallen now never to be raised up any more. in his pride for he was proud yet he let the world go from him freely. as it fell away he shook it off. dombey and son was no more his children no more. he felt her draw his arms about her neck. he felt her kisses on his face he felt oh how deeply all that he had done. i prayed to god to spare me that i might come. the moment i could land i came to you. a fearful man all in coarse grey with a great iron on his leg. said he and looked down at his leg. then he took me by the arms. you do it and you never dare to say a word concerning your having seen me and you shall be let to live. as soon as the darkness outside my little window was shot with grey i got up and went downstairs. i touched him on the shoulder and he instantly jumped up and it was not the same man but another man dressed in coarse grey too with a great iron on his leg. he was awfully cold. and his eyes looked awfully hungry. he exclaimed striking his left cheek. ii. he left me at the courtyard and a young lady who was very pretty and seemed very proud let me in and i noticed that the passages were all dark and that there was a candle burning. said the lady at the table. she said laying her hands one upon the other on her left side. what was an unfortunate boy to do i didnt know how to play. and what coarse hands he has i was very glad to get away. joe and i gasped and looked at one another. iii. i called out. and the man came on. i saw nothing that in the least explained him but i saw that he was holding out both his hands to me. he sat down on a chair that stood before the fire and covered his forehead with his large brown hands. i told him that i hoped he had mended his way of life and was doing well. and then he asked me if i was doing well. and when i mentioned that i had been chosen to succeed to some property he asked whose property im your second father. youre my son more to me nor any son. ive put away money only for you to spend. you aint looked slowly forward to this as i have. it warnt easy pip for me to leave them parts nor it wasnt safe. i said. its death to come back. thats the man wrapped in the cloak. at once there was great confusion. but i knowed you couldnt be that. i pressed his hand in silence. he had spoken his last words and holding my hand in his passed away. nothing was left of the old house but the garden wall and as i stood looking along the desolate garden walk a solitary figure came up. i saw it stop and half turn away and then let me come up to it. it was his school and he intended it to be a model. teach these boys and girls nothing but facts. facts alone are wanted in life. asked the astonished father. at the first mention of the name his daughter a child of fifteen or sixteen now but at no distant day to become a woman all at once stole a look at him remarkable for its intense and searching character. he saw nothing of it for before he looked at her she had again cast down her eyes. mr. bounderby was at stone lodge when they arrived. i wonder at you. i declare youre enough to make one regret ever having had a family at all. i have a great mind to say i wish i hadnt. then what would you have done i should like to know im sure you have enough to do if thats what you want. ii. he waited as if he would have been glad that she said something. now i should advise you to consider this question simply as one of fact. now what are the facts of this case you are we will say in round numbers twenty years of age. mr. bounderby is we will say in round numbers fifty. what does it matter let it be so. since mr. bounderby likes to take me thus i am satisfied to accept his proposal. tell him father as soon as you please that this was my answer. i must call him something. its impossible to be constantly addressing him and never giving him a name. you yourself wouldnt hear of joe you very well know. i am very glad to be so. it has long been my wish to be so. i have watched her bringing up and i believe she is worthy of me. at the same time i believe i am worthy of her. as the bride passed downstairs her brother tom whispered to her. iii. youre a man of family. said bounderby. i were sent for. look round town so rich as tis. i am quite ready to go in for it to the same extent as if i believed it. iv. i dont know what it is i shall never get its name now. but your father may. it makes me restless. she urged him to go away she commanded him to go away but she neither turned her face to him nor raised it but sat as still as though she were a statue. all this and more he said and pleaded for a further meeting. how could you give me life and take from me all the things that raise it from the state of conscious death now hear what i have come to say. i knew and father you knew and he knew that i never did. i was not wholly indifferent for i had a hope of being pleasant and useful to tom. but tom had been the subject of all the little tenderness of my life perhaps he became so because i knew so well how to pity him. father chance has thrown into my way a new acquaintance a man such as i had had no experience of light polished easy. i only wondered it should be worth his while who cared for nothing else to care so much for me. it matters little how he gained my confidence. father he did gain it. this night my husband being away he has been with me. i do not know that i am sorry or ashamed. father you have brought me to this. but no such change of mind took place in mr. bounderby. he retorted. i have got no more to say. which he did. these things were to be. these things were to be. such a thing was never to be. it had stood there many years before and it remained there some years afterwards but it is gone now and the world is none the worse without it. and he grew to be proud of the title. ii. one day he came back and said he was in for good that he had been taken for forty pounds odd. for the first time in all those years she sank under her cares. but are you familiar with the place the young woman whom you saw go in is my brothers child. you say you have seen her at your mothers and have felt an interest in her and wish to know what she does here. dont judge him sir as you would judge others outside the gates. they had walked some way before they returned. may i say it may i miss amy i know very well your family is far above mine. it were vain to conceal it. gasped young john. and goodbye john. and i hope you will have a good wife one day and be a happy man. iii. he slowly stretched out the hand that had been upon his heart and pointed at the wall. and in its place are the means to possess and enjoy the utmost that they have so long shut out. they had to fetch wine for the old man and when he had swallowed a little he leaned back in his chair and cried. everybody shall be remembered. i will not go away from here in anybodys debt. he returned in a sudden passion. and now the final hour arrived when he and his family were to leave the prison for ever. the carriage was reported ready in the outer courtyard. her father had thought she was with her sister. her sister had thought she was somewhere or other. they had all trusted to find her as they had always done quietly in the right place at the right moment. here is that child amy in her ugly old shabby dress. iv. the prisoner followed young john up the old staircase into the old room. but still she came and often read to him. i am as poor as when i lived here. inquired tom. i have had no parents these many years. now i come to the cream of my story and the occasion of my being here. i am in love with one of the most beautiful girls the sun ever shone upon. ii. the intentions that i bear towards you now are of another kind. i have been extremely well disposed towards that young man. horrible cried tom. asked tom. iii. we are no longer master and servant. a man advanced towards them when they landed walking slowly leaning on a stick. he exclaimed. my eldest son has a chill upon him. said mark. the rest have gone away. said mark. when they had brought up their chest martin gave way and lay down on the ground and wept aloud. anything but that their own land was mere forest. martin was by this time stirring but he had greatly changed even in one night. and now it was martins turn to work and sit beside the bed and watch and listen through the long long nights to every sound in the gloomy wilderness. the only thing to be done was to return to england. iv. presently came a knock at the door and young martin entered. the old man pointed to a distant chair. they all knew it. he cried upon the upper landing. leave him leave him i say you had better be off as he came smiling on and got within his reach old martin burning with indignation rose up and struck him to the ground. said martin. come hither my dear martin why did we ever part how could we ever part how could you fly from me to him the fault was mine no less than yours. mark has told me so and i have known it long. she trembled and was very pale but he sat her in his own chair and stood beside it holding her hand martin standing by him. her hand is trembling strangely. hold it if he clasped it half as tightly as he did her waist well well said ralph. ii. but the pupils when the boy knows this out of a book he goes and does it. in a furious voice. iii. nicholas caught the old gentlemans eye and began to wonder whether the stranger could by any possibility be looking for a clerk or secretary. returned the old gentleman. yes it is it is. it was a wilderness to me once. said the old man laying his hand on the shoulder of nicholas and walking him up the street. laying his finger on the sleeve of his black coat. nicholas nodded. educations a great thing. i never had any. i admire it the more in others. a very fine thing. tell me more of your history all of it. then brother charles related what nicholas had told him. im not going to the country either. ive opened the safe all that time every morning at nine and ive never slept out of the back attic one single night. if he wont listen to reason we must do it against his will. but in the meantime we are keeping our young friend and the poor lady and her daughter will be anxious for his return. and at that the brothers hurried nicholas out of the office shaking hands with him all the way. every night when nicholas came home something new had been found. there aint such a young man in all london. the city cant produce his equal. iv. the old gentleman took them aside. frank look here cried brother charles. he should have your sisters little hand sir if she had refused it a score of times ay he should and he shall what you are the children of a worthy gentleman. who needs to be told that they were happy the first act of nicholas when he became a rich and prosperous merchant was to buy his fathers old house. this was a t twist i named him. a council was held lots were cast who should walk up to the master after supper that evening and ask for more and it fell to oliver twist. the evening arrived the boys took their places. the master was a fat healthy man but he turned very pale. there was a general start. he left the house in the early morning before anyone was stirring struck across fields and gained the high road outside the town. ii. the strange boy whistled. the room that oliver was taken into was black with age and dirt. a good supper oliver had that night and a heavy sleep and a hearty breakfast next morning. it was so very funny that oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face. a few days later and he understood the full meaning of the game. so intent was he over his book that he might have been sitting in an easy chair in his study. then both boys ran away round the corner at full speed. was raised. dont take him away i saw it all iii. what connection could there be between the original of the portrait and this poor child he had hardly looked up when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his neck. cried oliver struggling. who is it oh oliver oliver oh you naughty boy to make me suffer such distress on your account come home dear come. oh ive found him the young woman burst out crying and a couple of women standing by asked what was the matter. said one woman. i havent any sister or father or mother. i dont know them cried oliver struggling in the mans powerful grasp. repeated the man. what books are these the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if there were any traces of oliver. but no oliver returned. iv. startled the boy dropped the lantern uncertain whether to advance or fly. theyve hit him. quick and then the noises grew confused in the distance and oliver saw and heard no more. it was morning when oliver awoke. the only house in sight was the one he had entered a few hours earlier and he bent his steps towards it. wounded miss you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did. come out with it heres a boy comes to that very same house next morning and because he happens to have his arm tied up these men lay violent hands upon him place his life in danger and swear he is the thief. if you could youd have done it long ago. i am poor. you have chosen your own path follow it. he put his hand into his breast and pulled out a bag. he said no more but taking the money locked it in an iron safe. the house was no longer theirs. ii. said the old man. thats it the long low white house there. whispered the landlord. its very plain besides that theyre not used to this way of life. i know better. the old man aint in his right mind. perhaps you havent thought so but its me thats your friend not him. the child was puzzled and could not tell what to say. recollect the friend. iii. know them do i look as if i knowed em it was granted immediately. he saw men playing cards and allowed to join them lost. flight was now the only thing possible before her grandfather should steal. how else could he get the money iv. beyond the pale 
flight by water a penny loaf was all they had had that day and very weak and spent the child felt. on her lips. he did not return at the usual hour and they went to seek him and found him lying dead upon the stone. his will is found. they quickly come out again. likewise could swear to clothes. ii. said the old fellow. think it over. dont you think we might do something for her have her to live with us we have come into a great fortune and we must act up to it. ii. she admitted as much to her father. that is another secret. and now there is only one more and it is very hard to tell it. not to me he is always the same to me but to others about him. a man of property like me is bound to consider the market price. if i pay for a sheep i buy it out and out. then he turned to his secretary. this young lady who was far above you. said the secretary quietly. go away and you can never come back. a few minutes later she went out of the house. iv. but for all that a change came in their affairs. and then he began. inquired mr. pickwick. to tell you the truth i have made up my mind. how thoughtful said mr. pickwick. cried the astonished mr. pickwick. dear me what a situation said sam. ii. inquired the little judge. exclaimed the little judge. inquired the judge. inquired the judge. said the little judge looking up. said the judge. i suppose you went to have a little talk about this trial eh mr. iii. he soon learnt that money was in the fleet just what money was out of it and that if he wished it he could have a room to himself if he was willing to pay for it. lord the matter was soon arranged and in a short time the room was furnished. iv. said sam. what for i see some good in this. heres a game one is a history that is more than a      history the other a tale that is more than a tale. i. recalled to life 
a large cask of wine had been dropped and broken in the street. it had stained many hands too and many faces and many naked feet and many wooden shoes. the master of the wineshop outside of which the cask had been broken turned back to his shop when the struggle for the wine was ended. three men who had been drinking at the counter paid for their wine and left. it had not lasted a minute when monsieur defarge nodded and went out followed by mr. lorry and the young lady. defarge repeated his words. it contained a little quantity of hair. he took the girls hair into his hand again. how can it be she had a fear of my going that night. she fell on her knees and clasped his neck. she cried. and as the darkness closed in they left father and daughter together. they came back at night. a coach stood outside the courtyard and the lately released prisoner in scared blank wonder began the journey that was to end in england and rest. ii. as he watched them go a person who had been leaning against the wall stepped up to him. carton drank but ate nothing. what the two drank together would have floated a kings ship. stryver never had a case in hand but what carton was there with his hands in his pockets staring at the ceiling. each had bottles and glasses ready to his hand. climbing to a high chamber in a well of houses carton threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed. sadly sadly the sun rose. iii. dr. manette turned towards him in his chair but did not look at him or raise his eyes. he asked. the name i bear at present is not my own. the doctor laid his two hands on darnays lips. go on a day shortly before the marriage while lucie was sitting at her work alone sydney carton entered. he covered her eyes with his hand. he continued. and left her. but lucie heard in the echoes none but friendly and soothing sounds. her husbands step was strong and prosperous among them her fathers firm and equal. the time came when a little lucie lay on her bosom. asked darnay. as mr. lorry spoke a letter was laid before him. darnay saw the direction it was to himself. he had told his secret to dr. manette on the wedding morning and to none other. asked mr. lorry. when alone darnay opened the letter. could he resist his old servants appeal he knew the peril of it but his honour was at stake he must go. on the next night he went out pretending he would be back byandby. iv. by him sat dr. manette lucie and her child were in an inner room. they had hastened after darnay to paris. darnay was indeed in danger. a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard. mr.
lorry put his hand on the doctors arm and they looked out. dr. manette hastened out of the room and down into the courtyard. there was a pause a murmur and the sound of his voice. it was long ere he returned. for fifteen months charles darnay remained in prison. during all that time lucie was never sure but that her husbands head would be struck off next day. that night he sat by the fire with his family a free man. lucie at last was at ease. she cried suddenly. there was a knock at the door four armed men in red caps entered the room. he asked with his wife and child clinging to him. he had come to paris he said on business his business was now completed he was about to return and he had obtained his leave to pass. asked the president. rapidly defarge told his story. the doctor had come too late both the woman and her brother died. a terrible sound arose in the court when the reading was done. death in twentyfour hours that night carton again came to mr. lorry. it was dr.
manette. be ready to start at two oclock tomorrow afternoon. see them into their seats take your own seat. the moment i come to you take me in and drive away. he bent down touched her face with his lips and murmured some words. the final hour he knew was three and he expected to be summoned at two. he heard footsteps. the door was opened and there stood before him quiet intent and smiling sydney carton. he came back with two men. they raised the unconscious figure and carried it away. the door closed and carton was left alone. there was none. he murmured an answer. as the patient eyes were lifted to his face he saw a sudden doubt in them. she whispered. demanded the guard. the papers are handed out and read. he is in bad health. crash crash and the women count two. she goes next before him is gone. i see her with a child upon her bosom who bears my name. on the other hand lord monmouth hated his younger son who had married against his consent a woman to whom that son was devoted. coningsby had never seen his grandfather. he heard things from millbank which were new to him. ii. a cloud passed over the countenance of millbank as the name of lord monmouth was mentioned but he said nothing only turning towards coningsby with an air of kindness to beg him since to stay longer was impossible to dine with him. she started blushed very much and then put forth her hand. opposite coningsby at dinner that night was a portrait which greatly attracted his attention. it represented a woman extremely young and of a rare beauty. the countenance of millbank became disturbed his expression was agitated almost angry. iii. the lady too though more prepared was not without confusion. in the morning his first thought was of her of whom he had dreamed. coningsby loved. coningsby gazed on the countenance of his companion. she turned her head and met his glance. the lovers returned late for dinner to find that mr. millbank was at home. i would appeal to my grandfather. in vain coningsby pleaded his suit. it was his mothers portrait he had looked upon that night at millbank and he understood the cause of the hatred. iv. he was weary of paris every day he found it more difficult to be amused. these are not times when young men should be out of sight. my information is from the highest quarter. we cant give a point. go now the game is before you she awaited with some excitement his return. in that same month other important circumstances also occurred. he seized the occasion to walk some distance by her side. said coningsby after some time. she was alone when coningsby entered the room. this fortune is yours. have confidence in yourself. the young couple stand now on the threshold of public life. what will be their fate it had been a religious house. ii. they were my fathers. i had no capital. iii. iv. the best blood in england and yet with all my wealth and power what memory shall i leave ah i have seen her. let me see what can be done. you are a leader of the people. let us have another meeting on the moor you forget what i am. i am not used to such passages in life. a union between the child and brother of nobles and a daughter of the people is impossible. his manner was strange and unusual. i can endure no longer the anguish of my life. i love you and if you will not be mine i care for no ones fate. i can save your father. she was found with her father and taken with him and six other men to bow street police station. in the evening the duke summoned his son into his library. he exclaimed. yes i have duties to perform in nothing in our religion our government our manners do i find faith. and if there is no faith how can there be any duty we have ceased to be a nation. said the duke pale with anxiety. oh let me save myself father said the duke. six centuries and more have gone by since then. how all our towns are growing ii. it is remarkable how quickly news travels in the east. the marks are fresh. he cried to his men. he shouted. the brother of the queen of the english is a mighty warrior. iii. what was this word to be tell them that they are the children of god. iv. what is their religion we do not care what goes on in the world around. cried the queen. you cannot guess what influence you have had on my fate. you came into my life like another messenger from god. as her head fell upon his shoulder the negro came running to the fountain. i stand well with you you stand well with me. replied henry. asked henry. you are a true daughter of france. he kissed his wifes hand and then with a quick step the king went down the corridor to his own apartment. exclaimed henry. turned away to the open window. said henry to himself. she said anxiously. i myself owe my life to chance for this very night they all but killed me in seeking you. directly i knew of your danger i sought you. she gave her hand to her husband and he seized it eagerly. ii. certainly became more friendly. shouted the king. charles rose with difficulty and seemed for a moment as if about to fall by the dead boar. he said. but for him henry iii. instead of henry it was one of his followers who was killed. iii. replied catherine. cried charles. the poison did its deadly work. the king turned pale. many things flashed across his memory and he knew his life was doomed. the book was in harrys room. the queen drew from under her mantle a figure of yellow wax about ten inches high wearing a robe covered with golden stars and over this a royal mantle. said charles. its power ends with his life. but henry is safe. for a crime has been committed and i have not three months to live. let your friend die. his death alone can save the honour of our family. i read this book too much so fond was i of the chase. a stream of blood choked his speech. he has been summoned by the queen. said the queen. cried catherine joyfully. you are just in time. said catherine crossing herself. all repeated the cry. poured in only to find the prisoner had escaped. ii. he almost choked with envy and from the moment of his discovery lived under continual fear. he had made out where they were growing and he plunged his hands into the soft soil only to find nothing. iii. the day came. to comfort the prisoner they assured him he would certainly be shot within twelve hours. iv. replied the president. certainly not and with that the president took up his pen and went on writing for he was busy over his report. he was ready with his tale. however he had recovered it. she asked. the prince asked. he said. then he entered his coach and was driven away. but i found it quite impossible to make my guide understand my feelings. we soon arrived at the house we sought. in the corridor a beautiful woman tall and dressed in black met me. she bade me welcome and promised me that of her son telling me that the house was at my service. my room was evidently that of the absent son and the most comfortable in the house. he went on to speak of his brother for whom he had a profound affection. they had already been parted for ten months and it was three or four years before louis was expected home. i was amazed. neither of them seemed to express the slightest doubt or surprise at this extraordinary statement. i accepted the invitation with pleasure. ii. his brother louis on the other hand had never touched either gun or pistol. iii. i was relieved to find that he was not suffering from illness and i told him of the anxiety of his family concerning his health. at five minutes to four he had not arrived and louis smiled at me over his wine. at that very moment the bell rang. d   went to the door and we could hear some argument going on in the hall. louis at once sprang forward. louis replied by telling the story of the quarrel. a friend of his a sea captain had married a beautiful woman so beautiful and so young that louis could not help falling in love with her. but you must promise to carry out my wishes and then my family may be saved a second misfortune. i read the letter louis had written. it was to his mother and it said that he was dying of brain fever. to prevent that i have written this letter. he paused. i knew that my own strange fear was his. i rushed to louis and raised him up. blood came to his lips. said louis. the dying man spoke with difficulty. he reminded me of my promise and asked me as he fell back to look at my watch. it was exactly ten minutes past nine and louis was dead. iv. i said in astonishment. i at once thought of the letter i had sent. i cried. i cried. and i have come to paris to kill the man who killed my brother. my brother had never touched a pistol in his life and it was as easy to kill him as to kill a tame stag. my mother knows why i have come. he dropped his pistol and threw himself into my arms. he cried. but his good fortune excited envy. he approached the fire and cast the fatal letter in. napoleon returned. again mounted the throne. ii. he muttered. placing it on his own bed he covered it with the rags he wore himself. on passing through this the noise of the waves was heard as they dashed on the rocks below. iii. everything he said he would do was done precisely. iv. he addressed her with passionate words of reproach as he turned to leave her. but this was the bargain they made. he sat down and waited. first on the palace stairs he ran violently into athos who was suffering from a wounded shoulder. and you think that sufficient. dartagnan had already passed on but this remark made him stop short. said dartagnan. cried dartagnan. i am ready. monsieur i love men of your stamp and i can tell that if we dont kill each other i shall enjoy your society. but it was too late. well duty before everything. he turned towards athos and his friends. you said you were but three but it appears to me we are four. ii. from this time the life of the four young men became common for dartagnan fell quite easily into the habits of his three friends. athos who was scarcely thirty years old was of great personal beauty and intelligence of mind. what the real names of his comrades were dartagnan had no idea. that the names they bore had been assumed was all he knew. said the king severely when in the middle of the ball he found to his joy that the queen was already wearing twelve diamonds. the man dartagnan to whom the queen owed this extraordinary triumph over her enemy stood unknown in the crowd that gathered round the doors. it was only when the queen retired that someone touched him on the shoulder and bade him follow. dartagnan felt that this was his reward. iii. the noise reached the cardinals ears and he inquired its meaning. muttered the cardinal. athos recognised him and the cardinal bade the three men escort him to a lonely inn. at the door they all alighted. the landlord of the inn received the cardinal for he had been expecting an officer to visit a lady who was within. a small vessel is waiting for you at the mouth of the river. you will go on board tonight and set sail tomorrow morning for england. half an hour after i have gone you will leave here. why then he must be got rid of. for a few seconds there was silence while the cardinal was writing a note. athos at once got up and told his companions he would go out to see if the road was safe and left the house. she said. said athos. athos slowly raised his pistol until the weapon almost touched the womans forehead. she drew the paper out of her bosom and handed it to athos. iv. the deadly poison did its work. they cried in a loud voice. then the cardinal summoned dartagnan to his presence. exclaimed the cardinal. said the cardinal in astonishment. for a time the cardinal sat looking at the paper before him. then he slowly tore it up. thought dartagnan. but i do not deserve this. cried dartagnan. said dartagnan. said dartagnan. dartagnan equally moved held him closely while tears stood in his eyes. the same night athos and his son also left for paris. ii. but hear me. my husband king of england is leading so wretched a life that death would be a welcome exchange for him. said athos. i ask much too much perhaps for i have no title to ask it. replied athos. said athos. believe me aramis there is little left to regret. just as they were leaving paris a letter came from athos who had already gone. may god and the remembrance of our friendship support you always. iii. at the same instant a tremendous shout filled the air and thirty swords flashed before them. athos exclaimed anxiously. the king who was entirely surrounded walked alone on foot. he caught sight of athos and aramis and greeted them. the day has been unfortunate but it is not your fault thank god charles shuddered. he saw a corpse at his feet. it was winters. said dartagnan. ah if we had you with us said athos. replied dartagnan bitterly. and the others agreed. iv. athos engaged to get everything ready for leaving england. he will answer you. asked the king. the four old friends met once more in paris before they separated. then all four embraced with tears in their eyes. and after that they departed on their various ways not knowing whether they were ever to see each other again. i.
     how and about little margery and her brother. they cried poor things and she sighed away her soul and i hope is happy. it would both have excited your pity and have done your heart good to have seen how fond these two little ones were of each other and how hand in hand they trotted about. pray see them. they were both very ragged and tommy had two shoes but margery had but one. our relations and friends seldom take notice of us when we are poor but as we grow rich they grow fond. chap. ii. how and about mr. smith. pray look at him. after some days the gentleman intended to go to london and take little tommy with him of whom you will know more by and by for we shall at a proper time present you with some part of his history his travels and adventures. at last tommy thus wiped off her tears with the end of his jacket and bid her cry no more for that he would come to her again when he returned from sea. however as they were so very fond the gentleman would not suffer them to take leave of each other but told tommy he should ride out with him and come back at night. when night came little margery grew very uneasy about her brother and after sitting up as late as mr. smith would let her she went crying to bed. chap. iii. as soon as little margery got up in the morning which was very early she ran all round the village crying for her brother and after some time returned greatly distressed. this so distressed mr. smith that he shed tears and cried lord have mercy on the poor she kissed her and cried as also did mr. smith but they were obliged to send her away for the people who had ruined her father could at any time have ruined them. chap. iv. how little margery learned to read                   and by degrees taught others. little margery saw how good and how wise mr. smith was and concluded that this was owing to his great learning therefore she wanted of all things to learn to read. you know what a sentence is my dear i will be good is a sentence and is made up as you see of several words. see here it is. here margery stopped and ran up to the door tap tap tap. whos there then out came the little boy. answered the other have you learned your lesson and pronounced them likewise. here a number of poor children were met to learn who all came round little margery at once and having pulled out her letters she asked the little boy next her what he had for dinner who answered bread. the poor children in many places live very hard well then says she set the first letter. and what had you polly comb for your dinner she then set them another task and we proceeded. i have been teaching says she longer than i intended and am afraid i am come too soon for you now. the letters being brought upon the table one of the little ones set up the following sentence. the lord have mercy upon me and grant that i may be always good and say my prayers and love the lord my god with all my heart with all my soul and with all my strength and honour the king and all good men in authority under him. then the next took the letters and composed this sentence. the third composed the following sentence. the fourth composed the following. i pray god to bless this whole company and all our friends and all our enemies. not pray for your enemies says little margery yes you must you are no christian if you dont forgive your enemies and do good for evil. tell me with whom you go   and ill tell what you do. a friend in your need   is a friend indeed. lesson ii. a wise head makes a close mouth. wit is folly unless a wise man hath the keeping of it. to forget a wrong is the best revenge. where pride goes shame will follow. lesson iii. a lie stands upon one leg but truth upon two. when a man talks much believe but half what he says. a contented mind is a continual feast. a lesson in religion. love god for he is good. fear god for he is just. pray to god for all good things come from him. praise god for great is his mercy towards us and wonderful     are all his works. those who have god for their friend shall want nothing. remember that all you do is done in the presence of god. the time will come my friends when we must give   account to god how we on earth did live. a moral lesson. a good boy will make a good man. honour your parents and the world will honour you. love your friends and your friends will love you. learn to live as you would wish to die. as you expect all men should deal by you

the man in the moon. you are not to wonder my dear reader that this little dog should have more sense than you or your father or your grandfather. you know this little bird sweet jug jug jug tis a nightingale. you would not think ralph the raven half so wise and so good as he is though you see him here reading his book. on sin. chap. iv. now pray tell me john and tell me martha when you have had a quarrel the over night are you not both sorry for it the next day they both declared that they were why then says she ill tell you how to prevent this for the future if you will both promise to take my advice. they both promised her. you should get up in the morning says she and to conduct yourselves as if that day was to be your last and lie down at night as if you never expected to see this world any more. ii. chap. peace and happiness depend so much upon the state of a mans own mind and upon the use of the considering cap that it is generally his own fault if he is miserable. chap. how mrs. margery was taken up for a witch                 and what happened on that occasion. and so it is true and they have taken up mrs. margery then and accused her of being a witch only because she was wiser than some of her neighbours mercy upon me the whole world ought to be made acquainted with her case and here it is at their service. the case of mrs. margery. a witch stop chap. and last. the true use of riches. in short she was a mother to the poor a physician to the sick and a friend to all who were in distress. the end. who can say why not paul bunyan it stands for the quality and service you have the right to expect from paul bunyan. babe could pull anything that had two ends to it. next morning the barn was gone. some were good and others just able to get by. paul never kept a poor one very long. they had to have colored boys to stand the heat. to call the men who came in at noon was another problem. they appeared to be rolling logs into a trap door from which poured clouds of steam. there was one man who was no good anywhere. he had failed at every job. he filled up a big kettle with beans and added some water. there was no way to get into the place to cook anything else so the whole crew turned in to eat up the half cooked beans. after that no one seemed to care much for beans. even in those days they had to watch out for forest fires. this saw worked all right in a level country in spite of the fact that all the trees fell back on the saw but in rough country only the trees on the hill tops were cut. the two oxen had been in pauls possession for a long time before lucy arrived on the scene. maybe so. the family life of paul bunyan from all accounts has been very happy. what is camp without a dog paul bunyan loved dogs as well as the next man but never would have one around that could not earn its keep. pauls dogs had to work hunt or catch rats. he was part wolf and part elephant hound and was raised on bear milk. because of this he never tired and anything he started after got caught. he was also a good fisherman. with this gun he could shoot geese so high in the air they would spoil before reaching the ground. then paul came on the job himself and got busy. the logs came up river faster than they went down. no job in iron or steel was too big or too difficult for him. thats the fellow. finally he met up with him. time is so valuable to paul he has no time to fool around at sixty miles an hour. in the early days he rode on the back of babe the big blue ox. this made it necessary for him to travel an extra three hundred miles north. sam brought them through without losing a bee. the cure was worse than the original trouble. they destroyed the ships but ate so much sugar they could not fly and all were drowned. the winter of the deep snow everything was buried. the next spring was the year the rain came up from china. the reason for this was soon apparent. hundreds of straw hats were used to make a lunch for babe. he decided to cut out labor altogether. the object of the game is to get the trees to the landing aint it he wanted to see if he could grow the same kind of white pine down there. when i come to collect they said this man was gone looking for a fountain of youth or some fool thing. i never seen them again. their search covered several years and reached all the important stands in the western states. whats the use when every letter that comes in is about things that happened the year before here is an instance. make ready aim the little girl came into her papas study as she always did saturday morning before breakfast and asked for a story. he tried to beg off that morning for he was very busy but she would not let him. its getting to be the season. her papa roused himself from his writing by a great effort. and at this her papa darted off like lightning and began to tell the story as fast as he could. so then she began to send her   letters and in about three weeks or just the day before christmas   it was she got a letter from the fairy saying she might have it   christmas every day for a year and then they would see about having   it longer. she just resolved to keep it to   herself and surprise everybody with it as it kept coming true and   then it slipped out of her mind altogether. she had a splendid christmas. she had a splendid christmas all day. said the little girl and she rubbed her eyes and tried   to rise up in bed. christmas they all shouted and waved their   stockings. her brothers and sisters just laughed. its   christmas today anyway. there it was again by that time people didnt carry presents around nicely any more. but it was nearly eight oclock   before the first boy in the united states woke up and then he found   out what the trouble was. there are about twenty   million boys in the united states and so you can imagine what a noise   they made. some men got together before night with a little powder   that hadnt turned into purple sugar yet and they said they would   fire off one cannon anyway. it was perfectly   awful. the little girl drew a deep sigh of satisfaction. her papa hesitated. the little girl had suffered so much that she had   talked about it in her sleep and after that hardly anybody would play   with her. wasnt it dreadful said her papa. the little girl held her papa fast around the neck. the people met together everywhere and   kissed and cried for joy. they had the   greatest time the little girl went to thank the old fairy because she had stopped   its being christmas and she said she hoped she would keep her promise   and see that christmas never never came again. then the fairy   frowned and asked her if she was sure she knew what she meant and   the little girl asked her why not this made the little girl think it all over carefully again and she   said she would be willing to have it christmas about once in a   thousand years and then she said a hundred and then she said ten   and at last she got down to one. then the fairy said that was the good   old way that had pleased people ever since christmas began and she   was agreed. asked the papa. said the little girl but she hated to have the story stop and was rather sober. the little girl caught him around the neck again. dont you tell what papa turkeys turning the tables. all the relations in the neighborhood had come to dinner and then   gone back to their own houses but some of the relations had come from   a distance and these had to stay all night at the grandfathers. but   whether they went or whether they stayed they all told the   grandmother that they did believe it was the best thanksgiving dinner   they had ever eaten in their born days. pleaded the little girl. sighed the little girl. well but the greatest thing of all was the turkey that they had. she was apt to lie awake thinking and some of her thinks were pretty   dismal. well that night instead of thinking and tossing and turning   and counting a thousand it seemed to this other little girl that she   began to see things as soon as she had got warm in bed and before   even. no indeed he made a long speech with his hat on and kept pointing at her   with one of his wings while he told the other turkeys that it was her   grandfather who had done it and now it was their turn. he said that   human beings had been eating turkeys ever since the discovery of   america and it was time for the turkeys to begin paying them back if   they were ever going to. he said she was pretty young but she was as   big as he was and he had no doubt they would enjoy her. the other little girl tried to tell him that she was not to blame and   that she only took a very very little piece. well she didnt know what to say thats a fact. you see she never   thought of it in that light before. where was i shouted the little girl. the little girl turned round and knelt in her papas lap so as to take him by the shoulders and give him a good shaking. says the papa. till it was   worse than the turkeys ten times. she knew that they meant her and she tried to explain that she just   had to promise and that if they had been in her place they would   have promised too and of course they could do as they pleased about   keeping her word but she was going to keep it anyway and never   never never eat another piece of turkey either at thanksgiving or at   christmas. the papa stopped. cried the little girl. the pony engine and the pacific express. then he saw that he would have to mind for they were awfully severe with him and always made him do exactly what they told him it was the way they had brought him up. he tried his best to get out of it for a while but after they had shaken him first this side and then that side and pulled him backward and forward till he did not know where he was he began to think perhaps he had better begin. and that made them just perfectly boiling for they understood his tricks and they knew he was trying to pretend that he had told part of the story already and they said he had not left off anywhere because he had not commenced and he saw it was no use. so he commenced. asked the boy. then he would put it softly down and be off again in the morning before it was awake. i tell you those were happy days for poor no. the boy lifted his head and looked at the little girl who suddenly hid her face in the papas other shoulder. said the little girl. and then she sobbed. asked the little girl gently. for she did not choose to be told by her brother he was only two years older than she was anyway. asked the boy. asked the little girl somewhat shocked and yet pleased. itll be as much as i can do to get through this story without going over any of it again. my but its mother was scared the little pony engine could not get it out of its head. the boy lifted his head. said the papa and he laughed. and never stopped to explain. the boy asked. and kept on. and the express kept gaining on it. and the express kept gaining on it. pacific express and the express kept gaining on it. said the boy. asked the boy. the little girl was almost afraid to ask. said the papa. whos telling this story anyway now i shall have to go back to the beginning. the express kept gaining on it. and the express kept gaining on it. express and then press and the express kept gaining on it. the little girl was crying and so he tried to comfort her by keeping her in his lap. the boy cleared his throat. pursued the boy. the boy thought awhile. said the boy. the papa set the little girl down and started to run out of the room and both of the children ran after him to pound him. sometimes he would go wrong on purpose or would pretend to forget and then they had a perfect right to pound him till he quit it. he usually quit pretty soon. the children liked it because it was very exciting and at the same time it had no moral so that when it was all over they could feel that they had not been excited just for the moral. the first time the little girl heard it she began to cry when it came to the worst part but the boy had heard it so much by that time that he did not mind it in the least and just laughed. says the farmer. im just going to cover myself with blossoms and blossoms that wont shut up either when the sun comes out but ll stay open as if they hadnt anything to be ashamed of and that wont drop off the first day either. said the papa. it was very fond of all its blossoms and it couldnt bear hardly to think of losing any of them but it knew they couldnt every one grow up to be a very large pumpkin and so it let them gradually drop off till it only had one left and then it just gave all its attention to that one and did everything it could to make it grow into the kind of pumpkin it said it would. so the bad little pumpkin vine began to pull and stretch towards the fence and sometimes it thought it would surely snap in two it pulled and stretched so hard. but besides the pulling and stretching it had to hide and go round because if it had been seen it wouldnt have been allowed to go to the fence. when it got to the fence at last it thought it was going to die. the question was how can a pumpkin vine climb a fence anyway thats the way it looked in the fall hanging from the vine on the fence when the first light frost came and killed the vine. asked the boy. heres that little fool pumpkin. what are you going to do with it asked the little girl. the little girl entreated and she clasped her hands to show how anxious she was. when the papa said anything like this the children had a right to pound him but they were so anxious not to have him stop that this time they did not do it. well i should think so the tables stretched from the kitchen into the diningroom and clear through that out into the hall and across into the parlor. said the boy. asked the little girl. all this time the boys were out in the barn waiting for the second table and playing round. as it was they were pretty hungry and they began on the pumpkin pie at once so as to keep eating till the mother and the other mothers that were helping could get some of the things out of the oven that they had been keeping hot for the boys. the pie was so nice that they kept eating at it all along and the mother told them about the good little pumpkin that it was made of and how the good little pumpkin had never had any wish from the time it was nothing but a seed except to grow up and be made into pies and eaten at thanksgiving and they must all try to be good too and grow up and do likewise. said the boy. well well. thats a good one what is it when the old grandmother got up close it thought it would do something extra to please her or else the heat of the candle had dried it up so that it cracked without intending to. the children were both silent for a moment. as if he were all bewildered. they shouted and they acted as if they were afraid he would try to get away from them by the way they held on to his arms. said the nephew. asked the papa. for she thought that would be a pretty good chance to get what they had come for. she returned. said the niece. i had to ask him. as soon as they stopped he opened his eyes. said the niece. the papa could not help laughing because that was just the very thing he was going to say. what about that story the papa was very contrary that morning. said the niece and she clapped her hands in great delight. the papa lay quiet a while. went both of the children and then they stopped themselves and stuffed the covering into their mouths. the papa lifted himself on his elbow and stared severely at them first at one and then at the other. he asked as if they had interrupted him but he really wanted to gain time so as to think up a story of some kind. this story is about a prince and a princess but the thing of it is that they had names almost exactly alike. the papa rubbed his forehead. hold on wait a minute i remember now of course he had just thought up the names. they knew he was just setting a trap for them and the same thought struck them both at once. the papa had heard every word they were laughing so that they whispered almost as loud as talking but he pretended that he had not understood and he made up his mind that he would have them yet. this was another of the papas tricks to gain time. i remember make ready aim dust and then the place would be cleaned up. ill guess ill go to sleep again. said the niece. that is about the only use there is in having a royal family. said the nephew running all his words together he was so anxious to know. the niece inquired rather faintly. but what did i say about asking questions because im waiting to find out. you have to wait and see how they will act. asked the nephew. perhaps when they meet the prince and princess we shall find out. she said that now something had got to be done she had stood it long enough and she was going to take the case into her own hands. marry them all just as they are right away right away right away she had to anyway. so she set out to return to the city with all the court following her diamond chariot and i can tell you she felt pretty gloomy. the cow that wont work. ive had that sort of thing tried on me before and it never works. the nephew stretched himself and then sat up in bed. the nephew lay down again in considerable dismay. how high was the tower anyway uncle this made the nephew so mad that he began to dig the papa with his fist and the papa began to laugh. the nephew had been lying quiet a moment. now he began to laugh. demanded his uncle. just like a girl. the tears came into the nieces eyes she had a great many feelings and they were easily hurt especially her feelings about girls. the children sprang out of bed and tried which could beat to the door. they forgot to thank the uncle but he did not seem to have expected any thanks. this view of things did not suit the king. in his very ears. then taking leave of the king she and her cat set out for their home. it was no small affair. mother mitchel did not like to lose her time. there were plenty of these as you may suppose in the country of the greedy mother mitchel had her pick of them. what a noise they made deep was the emotion of the fowls. and now mother mitchel called for a thousand pounds of the best butter. such energy had never been known before. perhaps also they were a little afraid of the cat whose great green eyes were always shining upon them like two round lamps and never lost sight of them for one moment. she had the patience to look through every egg to see if it were fresh. the number of eggs was complete and again mother mitchel and her cat had nothing to complain of. there was no need for her to examine so carefully the butter and the milk. but all was perfectly fresh. in that golden age they did not understand the art now so well known of making milk out of flour and water. if they had been let alone they would never have stopped till the sugar was all gone. some little people hidden in the corners took pains to find this out. and now the preparations were finished. there was no time to lose before setting to work. it was a great chance for the bold little things. the weather was so pleasant that the girls sat out of doors upon the ground in long rows. the sun looked down upon them with a merry face. one would never have expected to find all the thousand pounds of sugar again. it was all there but the experience of mother mitchel had counted upon such things and it may truly be said that there were never so many eggs broken at once or ever could be again. but this was not all. now began the real labour of mother mitchel. with mother mitchel there was no such word as fail. not only did these take less time to fill but they were safe from the children. but there was little toto who thought this was not enough. that could be heard for miles. the walls were no less than four feet thick. all went on well. it was not a quarter of an inch out of place. but all was not over. behind them stood mother mitchel with a box of matches ready to fire each oven as it was filled. but they did not really believe a word of this. one day was still wanting to complete the month. in the twinkling of an eye the thing was done. her fame was complete and a noble pride shone on her countenance. the royal procession arrived. very well. eat as much as you like. here is one big enough to satisfy you. why leave them open why indeed down with soup down with bread such cries came from every lip. as for the doctors they felt a joy beyond expression. they had reflected. they understood. but my friends at last the signal was given. who can tell how long the feast would have lasted if the king had not given his command that it should cease do not forget. yes marks of universal joy and emotion. noon and six oclock the second feast was as gay as the first and as long. said he with pretended indifference to the court physician. who would have thought it a single one answered to the call. truly he was big enough. but the next day even he the very last appeared no more. mother mitchel was in despair. it was dreadful as for the king he held his tongue and shut himself up in his palace but a secret joy shone in his eyes to the wonder of every one. he waited three days without a word. the good king went to every house without forgetting a single one. he visited small and great rich and poor. better were dry bread. your majesty for mercys sake a little dry bread thought these poor people. built upon a height it commanded the town. but this would not do they knew they felt it was there. it was a proof that they had learned something already that they understood this. the next day more soup. how this good soup comforted all the town the next day there was a little more bread in it and a little soup meat. then for a few days the kind prince gave them roast beef and vegetables. the cure was complete. it promised to last longer. the greedy people never fell back into their old ways. it is charming to see the red lips and the beautiful teeth of the people. if they have still a king he may well be proud to be their ruler. no but there is reason in all things. ask no more about mother mitchel. to complete her misfortune she lost her cat. alas for mother mitchel the king received the reward of his wisdom. thankful was about ten inches long made of the finest linen with little rosy cheeks and a fine little wig of flax. sarah held her close. our thanksgiving turkey is twice as big. sarah lowered her chin and shook her head with a decision that was beyond words. submit nodded violently. sarah shook her head again. sarah stared at submit. sarahs beautiful young aunt rose from boston was the special admiration of both the little girls. she returned. its just made out of a piece of old linen anyhow. inquired sarah. sarah hesitated. she inquired suddenly. what for i dont see anything to ask your mother for. sarah reflected. sarah tucked thankful closer under her shawl. just then the great turkey came swinging through the yard. his every feather stood out in the wind. he seemed enormous a perfect giant among turkeys. submit slowly got down from the wall. submit had been taught to obey her mother promptly. sarah looked after submit then she gathered thankful closer and also went into the house. sarah was her only child. said she. i aint set eyes on their turkey lately. she was so full of anxiety that she could not bear to put her away. her mother looked at her. i suppose you want to get out and gossip with sarah again at the wall but i cant let you waste any more time today. submit had cut her thumb quite severely. said her mother. and submit did not let the tears fall. she came from a brave race. cried submit. submits face fell. submit said no more. afterward she wiped dishes while her mother washed. all the time she was listening. her father and brothers had gone out presently she started. said she. called her mother. submit went in and swept the kitchen floor. the turkey lay there on the broad shelf before the window. submit looked at him. she thought he was small. then she got a needle and thread from her mothers basket sewed up the crop carefully and set the empty dish back in the cupboard. submit flew to her spinning wheel in the corner. submit left her spinning wheel. but they did not. that night when she went to bed she could not say her prayers. when she woke in the morning it was with a strange terrified feeling as if she had climbed a wall into some unknown dreadful land. she wondered if sarah would bring thankful over she dreaded to see her coming but she did not come. submit herself did not stir out of the house all that day or the next and sarah did not bring thankful until next morning. they were all out in the kitchen about an hour before dinner. submit was a little happier this morning. she said not a word to anybody but her little face was full of woe. her father asked. submit looked at him trembling. her lips felt stiff. her father looked very sober and stern. he turned to his father. there was silence. she did not cry. she was not so unhappy as she had been. she wondered if her father would whip her and she made up her mind not to cry if he did. all of a sudden sarahs face appeared there. presently sarah raised her window and put a stick under it then submit did the same. they put their faces out and looked at each other a minute before speaking. called submit softly. yours weighed the most. answering tears sprang to submits eyes. there was a touch on her shoulder. she looked around and there stood the grandmother. she looked across and there beside sarahs face in the window was another beautiful smiling one. called back submit. the beautiful smiling face opposite leaned close to sarahs for a minute. his strength had returned however and lately something of his old courage for he had found work. its cold. the old woman shook her head and muttered over the little pile of wood but she fed the fire and then turned and looked down the long white trail. but the night came down and the evening passed while the women waited anxiously. the wife asked anxiously. he asked anxiously. itll be weeks before i can do a stroke of work again. whatll they think the hard look grew deeper on his face. everythings against me everything following me like grim death. theres not wood enough cut to last a week. but his wife put her hand on his softly. he muttered. he glanced at the dark woods and drew up suddenly. he said. there was no doubt about it the horse was gone and the snow had covered every trace. muttered the cook in disgust. beetle ring rose to its feet as one man. a sudden sharp impatient whistle roused him and he strode hastily back to the waiting men. and the men rode back to camp silently. i had to. ill surely make it right. thanksgiving morning was a cold one but clear. you youll die if you try joe alone in the woods. his wife gave a sharp cry. its the horse she caught her husbands arm. say we want you powerful. youll come wont you big tears were in the womans eyes as she turned toward her husband. the young mother was soon placed carefully in the sleigh the old woman following. the latter stopped short with a curious expression on his face. he said softly. and the big fellow went out and closed the door gently. such a state of things had never been known since the town was settled. she burst out as soon as the door was opened at her knock. i say i wont have it put off oh dear if you are going to wait till next week i want to know it. we can bake enough for them with whats in the house. it is in her back kitchen. i saw it right by the door. mean old thing it was of course supposed that the calf had devoured the whole of the mighty cake as well as the pies. they had planted and cared for their first fields of corn. in the forest just back of the village wild turkeys and deer were easily shot. the summer had been warm with a good deal of rain and much sunshine and so when the autumn came there was a fine crop of corn. in his belt he carried a long knife. this was no matter for it was one of those warm weeks in the season we call indian summer. to supply meat for the occasion four men had already been sent out to hunt wild turkeys. they killed enough in one day to last the whole company almost a week. let us remember two of the fair girls who waited on the tables. what a merry time everybody had during that week and so the fun went on. the third day came. so the pipe of peace was silently passed around. the first thanksgiving took place nearly three hundred years ago. the no. echoed eph with delight. last of all came fisherman jones. and with the words fisherman jones went backward over the log waving the pole and a pair of stiff legs in air. roared eph rushing up. shouted eph. come back eph but when he reached the barn he saw the trouble. and in the midst of all this the clock stopped. and now ive got it. and there came a knock at the door. even eph looked a trifle blank at this. if it should be company he called. we all are. we want you to try some of our thanksgiving. it was mothers birthday and we cooked extra for that and weve got so much. we cant get all ours onto the table. its nothing more than you deserve and not half so much either. aint you always doing something for everybody and helping every one of these neighbours in all sorts of ways id like to know what the whole place would do without you we cant have it. he shouted. come in youre the folks we are waiting for eat fall to and now came on the week in earnest. and so of course it fell out. said my grandmother. it was a sort of family history going over and touching upon the various events which had happened. exclaimed donald observing graces expression of disappointment. and then donald thought he would go out in the air and play because his great dinner made him feel very uncomfortable. asked donald. it was now dusk and donald didnt like the idea of going to such a place. every turkey fixed its eyes upon the trembling boy who was beside himself with fear. there was one quiet turkey who had taken no part in the proceedings. donalds father bought me at a store. asked his little sister grace. asked donald with a laugh. there was a snap in his eyes and a look on his face that were certain proof of this. well well this was bold talk get you gone i will have none of your words. thanksgiving for the breaking up of school i do even now seek to bring you speedily the teaching you do so much stand in need of. and you did say that this thanksgiving was all our work. out upon you say i the widow november was very busy indeed this year. he at which grandfather time gave george a quarter and said he should always remember what a good boy he was. after dinner the fun increased all trying to do something for the general amusement. cried all the children. the fun was at its height when suddenly the clock in the corner struck twelve. the visit
a story of the children of the tower 
    the children went back to spend thanksgiving at     grandfathers farm. they got into some trouble and were     afraid that they would miss their dinner. he said as he drove through the big gate. the old horses pricked up their ears when they heard this and trotted away as fast as they could down the country road until they came to town. they had come to spend thanksgiving day on the farm. and so she was. said the sheep when they saw the children but then they always said that no matter what happened. said john and mary virginia began to cry. the shed had a long wide roof and there was a ladder leaning against it. when john saw that he thought he must go up on the roof and then of course the twins went too. and there they all sat in a row on the roof. cried the twins. said something down below and when they looked there was one of the cows rubbing her head against the ladder. and somebody i dont know who kicked the ladder and it fell down and lay in the dry grass. grandfather till he was tired but no grandfather answered. grandfather and when nobody heard that they began to feel frightened and lonely. cried the twins. and then they all called together once more but this time with such a weak little cry that not even the sheep heard it. so grandfather went out to look for them. and when nobody answered he made haste to the pasture. the children saw him coming and long before he had reached the gate they began to call with all their might. and i cannot tell you how glad they were. in another minute he had set the ladder up again and they all came down. mary virginia came first because she was the youngest girl and john came last because he was the biggest boy. grandfather put his arms around each one as he helped them down and carried mary virginia home on his back. when they got to the house dinner was just ready. it was a long hard way to go. there were rough roads to travel and steep hills to climb. and i want my dinner. said the old man. perhaps hes no home. a boy like me can stand it but i guess it must be hard for him. he wont come now its so late. so much the worse for him poor people if they behave themselves are just as respectable to me as rich folks. and the old man smiled again and seemed to look relieved. of course i dont do this way every day in the year. but mothers glad to have me once in a while. the little man asked. ill tell you why i dont. ive got the best mother in the world. some boys want one thing some another. everybody likes her and she has enough to do. we couldnt be with her of course. said the little old man. what i should have liked would have been some nice place where i could do light work and stand a chance of learning a good business. said the old man. dont this soup smell good and dont it taste good too they havent put so much chicken in yours as they have in mine. dont be afraid ill pay for it. thanksgiving dont come but once a year. you wont but the man shook his head. life isnt what we think it will be when we are young. youll find that out soon enough. it must be so lonely at your age come and see me and ill tell you all about my business and perhaps help you to such a place as you want for i know several business men. the pie was excellent not any more thank you and i hope youll come and see me. now wont you let me pay for my dinner i believe i have money enough. when he looked around again the little old man was gone. he offered him a chair then turned to lock up the money in a safe. ive money enough. i own houses in the city. they give me something to think of and so keep me alive. i like you i believe in you and ive an offer to make to you
i want a trusty bright boy in this office somebody i can bring up to my business and leave it with as i get too old to attend to it myself. it was nearly time for thanksgiving day. after school was over they ran home to their mother and asked her when thanksgiving day would be. she told them in about two weeks then they began to talk about what they wanted for dinner and asked their mother a great many questions. she told them she hoped they would have turkey and even the pumpkin pie they wanted so much but that thanksgiving day was not given us so that we might have a good dinner but that god had been a great many days and weeks preparing for thanksgiving. and thanksgiving day was for glad and happy thoughts about god as well as for good things to eat. then she told john but they agreed to keep it a secret till the day came. now what do you think they did well i will tell you. what for why for the birds. only these four had kept new englands festival beneath that roof. but there was another grief which he would fain have torn from his heart or since that could never be have buried it too deep for others to behold or for his own remembrance. within the past year another member of his household had gone from him but not to the grave. her brother was the next that greeted her. there is not one of these beloved faces that i shall ever hope to behold again on this earth. but as she listened to the familiar voice while the face grew more and more familiar she forgot everything save that prudence had come back. at that very instant however prudence started from her chair and held out both her hands with a warning gesture. but we miss your mother sadly prudence sadly. it was now the hour for domestic worship. cried they all with one voice. as prudence passed out of the door she turned toward them and flung back her hand with a gesture of farewell. but her face was so changed that they hardly recognized it. but sin alas at home he had no trouble. if next years a failure well go back if we can raise money enough to go with. he bent down and patted her shoulder his favourite way of soothing beast or human being. dont you go back on us. we can stand everything as long as you are all right. dont feel bad well pick up again. ive just wished that something would happen so wed have to go back east and its happened and we might have all been killed. and im going to stop just where i am. each had feared to appear weak to the other. they would buy a charge or two of powder and shot and he still had a few caps. it was a rare thing for his family to get a letter but then they seldom sent one. he would write to his uncle tomorrow and his brain began fairly to hum with what he would say. i hope you are well. dear me he waited patiently. finally the small wooden window was flung open. the little group got its papers and letters and gradually retired. sign your name on that line. odd name youve got. there was something wrapped in neat white paper and feeling very solid. he opened it. asked his mother as soon as he was inside the door. ma opened the box and then the purse and then the fourteen round objects wrapped in white paper. give my love to your parents and little sister and     if you look the purse through closely i think you will     find something of interest to your mother. be a good boy. my he asked. and so they were. he did not even look up when his sister minty came up the hill toward him. pursued minty. you dont know what an awful hard world it is. mintys face grew so long that it looked like the reflection of a face in a spoon and the tears came into her eyes. it must be a hard world since jason found it so. all these troubles jason bore bravely. it generally was aunt kittredge. continued jason with almost a break in his voice. gasped minty. he cried. jason stared at her in amazement. perhaps the high forehead meant something after all. certainly the high forehead meant something. the new minister and his daughter came to dinner and jason and minty were glad that the children had seats at the far end of the table. seems kind of a pity to kill her she was so handsome. but she eats real well. minty had never shown herself a leading spirit before. and when she does notice she wont know what became of it. there was another dreadful moment when the ministers daughter went home. just then the voice of the new ministers daughter came to their ears. it was so great a relief that tears sprang to mintys eyes when after a little more conversation the ministers daughter went away. and aunt kittredge was quite capable of asking the ministers daughter to return it. but suddenly a bright idea struck her. the feather on her summer sunday hat but as she was going out of the house there stood the ministers daughter in the doorway talking with aunt kittredge. she demanded sternly. poor minty there was no hope of keeping a secret from aunt kittredge when once she had discovered that there was one. but alas she found that lot was not to be persuaded. jason who had been very anxious met her at the corner. he said only a girl would be so foolish as to send that feather to the ministers daughter. he hoped she was going to have sense enough not to tell no matter what aunt kittredge did. minty gave him a little grateful glance but she could not speak. there was a visitor. exclaimed uncle kittredge. minty broke away from jason who would have held her back not feeling sure that it was quite time to speak and rushed into the room. i paid with my own money aunt kittredge said uncle kittredge. gasped aunt kittredge. the thanksgiving goose
    how a little boy learned to be thankful. a charming     story even though it has a moral. turkey is best for thanksgiving anyway. guys mother did not answer. five others all alike and all marked alike lay beside it. never mind the rest of the things that you dont like. tell her that i shall have a days work for her on friday and i thought she might like to have part of the pay in advance to help make thanksgiving with. she wont like that. the little ones almost never cry and i never have seen the older ones quarrel. my room isnt big enough but i dont believe theres a room in this house as big as mine. i shouldnt have a bit of fun ever if i lived here. then he knocked on the front door for there was no bell. no one came. he could hear people talking in the distance so he knew some of the family were at home. some one always was at home here to look after the little children. he walked around to the kitchen door it stood open. the children were talking so fast they did not hear his knock. they were very busy. what they were saying seemed so funny it was some time before guy could understand it. at last he was sure it was some kind of a game. the children fairly roared at that. guy knocked very loudly at that. he had not thought that he was listening. the children started but did not leave their work. they looked at their mother. asked guy forgetting his errand. dont you want to play i thought that was work. i meant what you were saying. it sounds so funny we always play it at thanksgiving time. you think of something that people dont like and the one who can think first tells what he is thankful for about it. guy stayed for an hour and played both games. in the afternoon guy spent some time writing a note to his mother. it was badly written but it made his mother happy. but my old ones are     nice. i am thankful for the goose we are going to have. now the great ceremony of the evening was to begin the harvest song in which every man must join he might be in tune if he liked to be singular but he must not sit with closed lips. the ceremony connected with the song was a drinking ceremony. but in vain. a small boy in the city did     his best to satisfy them. this is at once a story of     thanksgiving and of christmas. what do you suppose ellen found in the turkey you never could guess. see what ive found in the turkey my so freddie all excitement rushed upstairs and into his mothers room shouting as we have read. his mother took the letter from him. freddie listened very much interested sometimes helping to make out the letters while his mother read this remarkable letter. at its conclusion he dropped upon a chair in deep thought while in his imagination he saw a small black house surrounded by turkeys running wildly about while a little girl tried to catch the largest. he seemed to think the house was little because the girl was little. and if we cant get a new one wont you tell beth to send one of hers there was no time to lose if the doll was to be sent for christmas so both letters were written that very evening and freddie begged to put them in the post box himself that there might be no mistake in that. then came a long time of waiting for master fred. it right away as you wish     by this mornings mail which i must put up pretty soon     so this letter must be short. didnt have no show while the old man was alive. i dont think of     anything more to say so will close. shouted both children at once. mrs. page was only too willing so she promised only adding that she hoped the minister would give an equally good account. first beths dolls were looked at to see if one of them would do to take a trip into the country but although there were quite a number of them none seemed to just suit their ideas of what lucys doll should be. we wish you all a merry christmas and a happy new year. beth page                                              fred page. but the children cared little for this letter their faith in lucy was not shaken and they were very happy that they had answered her letter. murmured the young man. but oh how my cheeks burn we forget all about the cold. the turkeys got to be stuffed yet then how we all fly around then i get nervous and worried. how fresh an sweet they smell how you talk jest as if mother doesnt know mother. the little     lady called hearts delight saw to that. everybody felt very thankful. silence was always wishing beautiful things like that. just nuts hearts delight had guessed it the very first guess. laughed all the little grand girls and boys. why of course he would rather have just nuts for thanksgiving dinner cried silence. it was the shy little voice of hearts delight. a soft pink colour had come into her round cheeks. he cried. and sure enough it was. hearts delights little shy face nearly hid itself over her plate. this was dreadful it was necessary to change the subject at once and a dear little thought came to her aid. are we not doing our best are we idle are we indifferent shall we not be found waiting and watching of all this however the master of the harvest heard nothing so the gloom did not pass away from his face. and still thinking thus he laid his head on his pillow and presently fell asleep. after which the good woman knelt down to pray and as she prayed she wept for she knew that she was very ill.
but what she prayed that night was heard only in heaven. to which her husband made no answer but turned away and spoke of something else. and day by day the master of the harvest saw them and was satisfied but because he was satisfied and his anxiety was gone he spoke of other things and forgot to rejoice. what more does he want have we not done our best are we not doing it minute by minute hour by hour day by day and so it came to pass that they went out together. but of all this he knew nothing and what he thought as he listened was that she was as weak in mind as in body and what he said was that a man must be an idiot who would not complain when he saw the bread taken from under his very eyes and why does she weep are we not doing all we can shall we not be found ready at last why does he murmur and why does she weep as best it could would the master of the harvest ask more alas but of all this the master of the harvest heard nothing so he did not cease to complain. and such a storm ears over ears they bowed down ears above ears they rose up. they bowed down as if they knew that to resist was destruction they rose up as if they had a hope beyond the storm. oh husband pray for the corn and for me that it may go well with us at the last but whether he prayed for either the corn or her that night she never knew. and presently came a new distress for when the days of rain had accomplished their gracious work and every one was satisfied behold they did not cease. and has not mercy been with us sooner or later all along why does he always complain but of all this the master of the harvest heard nothing. but his wife had risen no more from her bed where she lay in sickness and suffering yet in patient trust watching the sky through the window that faced her pillow looking for the relief that came at last. but the master of the harvest was bending over the bed of his dying wife. and then she laid her hand in his and so fell asleep in hope. in a few minutes he had finished and was quite satisfied with his appearance but for his shoes. he looked with longing eyes from one dish to another. he exclaimed. but his heart sank the front seat how ever was his lunch to come in now but what was that what had he done with it oh there it was at last way down in the depths of his right trousers pocket. to his surprise the service seemed to go right on as usual. in a twinkling she was back again this time however she was not alone. what could he mean but they neednt be looking for another next year. there is plenty of humour in this tale of a     turkey hunt. all of them raised their heads and looked at him as he passed them by. the long years seemed suddenly to have rolled away leaving him once more a boy. he almost wondered why dick had not whistled to him as he used to do. after a pause he repeated the call then came another pause another call and over in the distance there sounded an answer. there it was again. it was coming nearer but very slowly. he wondered how many were in the flock and called once more. exclaimed the other. asked one of them and the other readily agreed that they had as they once more grasped hands before parting. for boys or girls. there is one sound that i shall always remember. the cottage stood in from the road. there was a long meadow in front of it. it was a sunny day and my heart was light. my heart gave a bound where did that sound come from it seemed to have no head. i knew however that it had a head. i had seen it it had seized me once in the previous summer and i had been in terror of it during all the rest of the season. it was coming toward me and faster and faster as it approached. it was a call of triumph. the head was high in the air now. i stood with beating heart after my retreat. he bit one. it was good. this was too much. he stopped immediately. his head was in the air again. if i were to be whipped i should choose a broom not the stick. i was expecting you and had been looking out for you but missed sight of you. his tone of voice was very proud and he did not seem to be speaking well of me. i was suspicious that he did not think me a very brave lad. they started up the walk upon the run as though they expected to be followed and haste was necessary to prevent the failure of their plans. they stopped. it was a voice of authority. said the bride. the latter seemed to think he had been attacked by dragons. as soon as he could shake him off he ran. what became of the bridegroom or how the matter ended we never knew. said i one evening as we were sitting on the lawn before the door. he knows something that no one else knows. i could not have him killed or sent away. he was a good boy to me. he loved his mother. it was on my account that he went away. we worked hard and had a hard time. asked i in surprise. how i felt i took them into the house at first but afterward made a pen for them out in the yard. i havent got much i have done all i can for him poor boy. i think of him now as one who disappeared. it was a terrible month on the coast that year. i could not sleep on the nights of those high winds. it was like a wild goose. i listened it was repeated. i was lying in bed. i started up i thought i had been dreaming. the moon was full the air was calm and still. it was almost as light as day. could it be he seemed to know me. i was so faint that i sat down on the meal chest. the door opened. it was thanksgiving. the church bell would soon be ringing as on sunday. where was the vessel you know i waited and waited for my boy to come back. i wish he could talk poor bird i wish he could talk. although poor he was a man of a kind and contented disposition. he was always thankful to the great spirit for everything he received. in the meantime he prepared himself and immediately went into it and commenced his fast. but could he not make it easier for us to get our food than by hunting animals and taking fish on the third day he became weak and faint and kept his bed. he fancied while thus lying that he saw a handsome young man coming down from the sky and advancing toward him. for the first time he entered the lodge and sitting down beside the youth he began to deliver his instructions to him telling him in what manner he should proceed to take advantage of his victory. i know this and now tell you what you must do to benefit your family and your tribe. once a month cover me with fresh earth. he then shook him by the hand and disappeared. if the great spirit will favour you he will do it now. it is seven days since you have tasted food and you must not sacrifice your life. but he never for a moment forgot the grave of his friend. days and weeks had passed in this way. he then pulled an ear. so corn came into the world. something very mysterious was going on in the jarvis kitchen. jessie went often to the door leading into the hall and listened and if there came a knock on the floor she snatched off her apron hastily wiped her hands rolled down her sleeves asked betty if there was any flour on her and then hurried away into another part of the house trying to look cool and quiet as if she had not been doing anything. asked betty as soon as she could speak. mrs. jarvis couldnt have had any nose at all if she didnt smell that. jessie hesitated. nothing was said about them either and it was not thanksgiving nor christmas though it was only a few days before the former. it was certainly odd and stranger things happened that night. in the first place jessie sat up in her room and wrote a letter and then after her mother was in bed and everything still she stole down the back stairs with a candle quietly as though she was doing some mischief. betty opened it and there stood a man. said he. not one of those good things ever went into the jarvis diningroom the next morning things went on just as usual in the house. jessie resumed her study and especially her practice for she hoped some day to be a great musician. let us see where it went. evidently luck had not been good for the whole place appeared run down and the two looked absolutely hungry. both were sad and the younger one almost hopeless. jack started up. jack stood staring at the box as if he had lost his wits. it could not be from home for no one knew where he went when he stole out of the house one night six months ago and ran away to seek his fortune. not a line had he ever written not even when very ill as he had been not even when without a roof to cover his head as he had been more than once not even when he had not eaten for two days as also alas had been his experience. but no smile followed. it was from home on the very top was a letter addressed to jack jarvis in a hand that he well knew. as one by one these things were lifted out and placed on the bench a deep silence reigned in the cabin. he did not feel hungry either. he sat and stared for some time. then he remembered his letter. he drew it from his pocket and opened it. this was another shock that brought something to his eyes that made him see the others through a mist. at last he read the letter. it began
    dear jack ive just found out where you are and     im so glad. i send you this thanksgiving dinner. it     was too bad for you to go off so. you dont know how     dreadful it was for mamma she was sick a long time     and we were scared to death about her but shes better     now she can sit up most all day. oh jack father cried im sure he did and he     almost ran out of the room and didnt say anything to     anybody all day. but i was determined id find you. i     shant tell you how i did it but uncle john helped     me and now jack he says he wants just such a fellow     as you to learn his business and hell make you a very     good offer. i didnt tell     anybody because i want to surprise them and besides     let them think you came home because you got ready. its nobodys business where you got the money anyway. now do come right home jack. you can get here in a     weeks time i know. your affectionate sister                                                     jessie. he sat there for hours he knew nothing of time. she had often talked it over with jack. on toms entrance he roused himself. there was a new light in his eye. but not to sleep at least not jack who tumbled and tossed all night and got up in the morning with an energy and life he had not shown for weeks. you may have my     share of everything. jack. the table was spread in the diningroom with the best silver and linen. jessie went around with a shining face that no one understood and she could not explain. jessie heard the train she had decided to be the important one. you all know how it happened. the door opened and jack walked in. jack fell on his knees with his face in his mothers lap though he had not thought a moment before of doing any such thing. there is little more to tell. who ate the dollys dinner asked polly pine. said polly pine. the doll house stood in the nursery. it was very big and very beautiful. then she set the table in the diningroom with the very best dishes and the finest silver. polly pine just hopped up and down with delight when she saw it. then polly remembered and she jumped down from her chair and asked mamma if she might go upstairs and see if the dolls had eaten their dinner. when mamma told about the doll house thanksgiving all the family wanted to go too to find out if the dolls had enjoyed their dinner. the front door of the doll house was open and there sat the dolls just as their little mistress had left them only they had eaten nearly all the dinner in a minute he was gone nobody knew where. there was another tiny mouse in the doll house under the parlour sofa and a third one under lavinias bed with a poor frightened gray tail sticking out. they all got away safe. papa would not allow mamma to go for the cat. it will be most enjoyed     by the older children. goodbye folks bright. this was their wedding journey. but hannah did not cry about it. hannah was going to her own home to a much easier life and going with john. why should she cry but none of these things worried hannah. and by sunset next day the little party drew up at the door of the log hut they called home. it looked very pretty to hannah. aint it real pleasant here the old cabin had disappeared entirely. poor enough they were still. hannah kept up her smiling courage through it all. if her heart gave way nobody knew it but god and john. then she set them all to work. at least they each knew how to read and most of them to write after a very uncertain fashion. so the summer went on. father and the boys were fighting now and mothers merry words were more rare though her bright face still wore its smiling courage. hard times these were. hannah was thankful and grateful beyond expression. after that she always thought her mother saw the sun when nobody else could. you must submit you must submit. i dont know much about that kind o vessel. ive got to submit because there aint anything else to do as i see. her father was old and feeble. he would be glad to have her with him and betty. hannahs face grew brighter still. not from the army though. only once since had news reached them from that quarter. it was only when her eight children rejoiced in the hearing that she dared to be happy. only to think of it they would wait a year before thinking of marriage both for better acquaintance and on account of the troubled times. ah he could afford to wait a year for such a spring blossom as that surely. so the summer rolled away. poor hannah there was great excitement as hannah read aloud the madams note. why oh do and dollys the oldest. dollys goin sure. mother had to laugh. now lets see. thats the good o good cloth. itll last most forever. but my stars you cant wear that anyhow. ive fixed that. aint our dolly smart hannah could scarce believe her eyes. the parson however abruptly put an end to the scene. my dear friends let us recollect ourselves. there is a time for all things. johns story was quickly told. so they burst in upon the wedding. i tell you i was glad ont. i knew how he felt. was a question which distressed more than one household that year. indeed it was often a question what to have for dinner supper or breakfast on any day. heavy weather and head winds held him back on his voyage home. he cried. shoot him the sight roused the boys to save their horse. moreover the boys had to run fast through the brush to keep them in sight. there it stood still shaking its head. there was no time to search for it. the boys shouted to frighten him off. the crazy creature appeared neither to hear nor heed. the boys could no more have moved it than they could move a mountain. moreover it was now beginning to snow fine and fast. the end
