    <h1>What is a Language Model (LLM)?</h1>
    <p>A Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence that is trained to understand, interpret, and
        generate human language. These models are trained on large datasets of text and learn to predict the likelihood
        of a sequence of words. This enables them to perform a variety of language-related tasks such as translation,
        summarization, question answering, and more.</p>
